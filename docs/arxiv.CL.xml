<div> Self-Refinement, Large Language Models, Evolution, Training, Inference<br>
<br>
Summary: This study investigates the concept of Self-Refinement in large language models (LLMs) and proposes the EVOLVE framework to improve this capability through iterative training. The research finds that LLMs typically do not exhibit inherent Self-Refinement and may suffer from decreased response quality after attempted refinement. EVOLVE addresses this issue by optimizing training methods to activate Self-Refinement and exploring generation strategies during inference to enhance and utilize this ability effectively. By synergistically optimizing both training and inference stages, the model's Self-Refinement evolves, leading to improved response quality and overall model performance. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve significant boosts in performance, surpassing state-of-the-art models in various tasks such as length-based and raw win rates, as well as demonstrating generalization to out-of-domain reasoning tasks like mathematical reasoning benchmarks GSM8K and MATH.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.

Summary:<br>
- A study analyzed user engagement with LGBTQ+ news content on YouTube, focusing on positive and negative interactions.
- A hope speech classifier was developed to detect positive content, along with negative, neutral, and irrelevant content.
- An annotation study was conducted with diverse political representation to create a dataset with detailed labels and annotator demographic information.

Abstract: This paper makes three contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of 1,419,047 comments posted on 3,161 YouTube news videos of major US cable news outlets, we analyze how users engage with LGBTQ+ news content. Our analyses focus both on positive and negative content. In particular, we construct a fine-grained hope speech classifier that detects positive (hope speech), negative, neutral, and irrelevant content. Second, in consultation with a public health expert specializing on LGBTQ+ health, we conduct an annotation study with a balanced and diverse political representation and release a dataset of 3,750 instances with fine-grained labels and detailed annotator demographic information. Finally, beyond providing a vital resource for the LGBTQ+ community, our annotation study and subsequent in-the-wild assessments reveal (1) strong association between rater political beliefs and how they rate content relevant to a marginalized community; (2) models trained on individual political beliefs exhibit considerable in-the-wild disagreement; and (3) zero-shot large language models (LLMs) align more with liberal raters.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of machine learning models to predict patient outcomes using clinical case reports. By extracting timestamped clinical findings and utilizing large language models, such as transformers, the researchers evaluated different models for event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. They found that encoder-based models performed better in event forecasting, while decoder models showed advantages in survival analysis. Time ordering was deemed crucial for accurate predictions, emphasizing the importance of constructing time-ordered corpora for temporal tasks in the context of large language model usage. The study highlights the potential for utilizing temporal patient trajectories encoded in clinical text for improved predictive accuracy. <br> <div>

Abstract: Clinical case reports encode temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.

Summary: TemplateRL is a structured template-guided reinforcement learning framework that improves model reasoning. It addresses the limitations of existing RL methods by integrating explicit template guidance into training. By constructing problem-solving template libraries using MCTS and guiding rollout generation based on proven template structures, TemplateRL enhances trajectory hit rates and reduces ineffective exploration. The structured design stabilizes training dynamics and increases sampling efficiency. The interpretable and editable template library supports continuous updates during both training and inference.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for enhancing model reasoning. However, existing RL methods like GRPO often rely on unstructured self-sampling to fit scalar rewards, often producing inefficient rollouts that fail to capture transferable problem-solving strategies. To address these limitations, we propose **TemplateRL**, a structured template-guided RL framework that augments policy optimization with explicit template guidance. Our approach first constructs a problem-solving template library via MCTS on a small seed set, then seamlessly integrates this high-level structured guidance into RL training. By guiding rollout generation to align with proven template structures, TemplateRL significantly improves high-quality trajectory hit rates while reducing ineffective exploration. This structure-guided design steers the policy toward validated strategic patterns, stabilizing training dynamics, and enhancing RL sampling efficiency. Notably, the explicit template library is interpretable, editable, and supports online updates-enabling continuous updates during both training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemplateRL outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME and 41% on AMC, with superior stability on weak models and remarkable cross-domain generalization, highlighting its potential for broader tasks.

Summary:
The study examines the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering factual questions and highlights a significant inconsistency in how these models access factual knowledge across different task complexities. The researchers introduce the Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ) framework to compare LLMs' responses to factual questions presented in both simple and complex formats. They discover a systematic misalignment in the answers provided by LLMs for short and long queries, along with position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects. The study also reveals that aligned facts activate similar internal mechanisms within the models and proposes that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict answer alignment accuracy. Overall, the research underscores the importance of factual consistency in LLMs across varying query complexities and raises questions about the trustworthiness of current evaluation practices that may not adequately assess the reliability of these models for complex knowledge-seeking tasks.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Summary:
Using large language models (LLMs) for survey synthesis can introduce significant bias in population estimates. By combining synthesis with rectification methods, bias can be reduced to below 5% and the effective sample size increased by up to 14%. Allocation of human responses between synthesis and rectification is crucial, with findings challenging the common practice of allocating all human responses to fine-tuning. A fixed budget allocation, with more responses allocated to rectification, results in more effective estimation. Two panel surveys on nutrition, politics, and economics were used to study the interplay between synthesis and rectification methods, highlighting the potential for LLMs to provide scalable, low-cost alternatives to traditional surveys when properly utilized.<br><br>Summary: Using large language models for survey synthesis can introduce bias, but combining synthesis with rectification methods can reduce bias and increase sample size.

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning, showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in far more effective estimation.

<div> framework, LLMs, mathematical statements, theorem proving, retrieval <br>
Summary: <br> 
The article introduces DRIFT, a framework designed to assist Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving. LLMs often struggle to identify and utilize prerequisite mathematical knowledge and formal representations in languages like Lean. DRIFT addresses this challenge by breaking down complex informal mathematical statements into smaller, more manageable sub-components. This enables targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib and provides illustrative theorems to aid LLMs in formalization tasks. Evaluation across different benchmarks demonstrates that DRIFT significantly improves premise retrieval, showing a nearly doubled F1 score compared to existing methods. Particularly, DRIFT exhibits strong performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Summary:<br />
This paper explores the use of Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) models for Natural Language Inference tasks. By leveraging quantum circuits, the study compares quantum, hybrid, and classical transformer-based models under a few-shot constraint. The research utilizes the lambeq library and DisCoCat framework to create parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs, training them for semantic relatedness and inference classification. A novel metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), is introduced to assess learning efficiency independently of model size. Results indicate that quantum models achieve comparable performance to classical baselines with significantly fewer parameters. Quantum models outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference tasks and show lower test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit remarkably higher learning efficiency per parameter, suggesting the potential of QNLP in scenarios with limited resources and structure sensitivity. A novel cluster-based architecture is proposed to enhance generalization by linking gate parameters to learned word clusters instead of individual tokens. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource, structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234 radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of 62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a 95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions, agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

Summary: 
Self-correction methods for large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing their reasoning performance. In this study, the CorrectBench benchmark evaluates the effectiveness of various self-correction strategies across tasks such as commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. The findings suggest that self-correction methods can improve accuracy, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Combining different self-correction strategies can lead to further enhancements but may decrease efficiency. LLMs designed for reasoning have limited optimization with additional self-correction methods and can be time-intensive. Surprisingly, a basic chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results emphasize the potential of self-correction in improving LLM reasoning while highlighting the ongoing challenge of balancing reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Further research is needed to optimize this balance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page: https://correctbench.github.io/

Summary: 
The EvolveR framework addresses the limitation of Large Language Model (LLM) agents by enabling self-improvement through a closed-loop experience lifecycle. The framework consists of two key stages: Offline Self-Distillation, where interaction trajectories are synthesized into reusable strategic principles, and Online Interaction, where the agent uses distilled principles to guide decision-making and updates its performance through policy reinforcement. By incorporating self-learning capabilities, EvolveR outperforms strong agentic baselines in complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks. This approach not only allows agents to learn from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, leading to more autonomous and continuously improving systems. The code for EvolveR is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making, accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously improving systems.

Summary: This study evaluates the interaction between prompt strategies and large language models (LLMs) in automating the screening stage of systematic literature reviews. Six LLMs and five prompt types are tested across relevance classification and Level-2 tasks, showing varied performance outcomes. Chain-of-thought-few-shot prompt yields the most reliable precision-recall balance, while zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes. Self-reflection prompts demonstrate over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek exhibit robust performance, with GPT-4o-mini offering competitive results at a lower cost. Cost-performance analysis reveals significant differences among model-prompt pairings, recommending the use of low-cost models with structured prompts for initial screening and escalation of borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to automate literature screening but highlight the need for task-specific prompt selection. <br /><br />Summary: This study explores how prompt strategies impact the performance of large language models in automating systematic literature reviews.

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection) across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance; zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that (1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

<div> Keywords: language models, generalization, factual recall, contextual structure, diversity level

Summary:
This article presents a synthetic testbed for analyzing the impact of contextual diversity and factual associations on language model generalization. The study finds that higher contextual diversity can delay in-distribution factual accuracy, but its effect on out-of-distribution generalization varies depending on contextual structure. Optimal diversity levels for factual recall depend on training duration, with some structures exhibiting failures in both factual recall and statistical generalization. The study identifies distinct optimization bottlenecks leading to out-of-distribution failures, highlighting the importance of embedding and unembedding layers in language models. The synthetic framework allows for controlled interventions to isolate specific effects, providing a valuable testbed for future investigations.

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD) factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration. Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade. This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed for future investigations.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025) spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a representative sample were combined with classification models to scale analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g., experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public perceptions of GenAI.

Summary: 
A new multimodal dataset, EgMM-Corpus, focusing on Egyptian culture has been introduced in this paper to address the lack of culturally diverse datasets, especially for regions in the Middle East and Africa. The dataset consists of over 3,000 images covering various concepts such as landmarks, food, and folklore, each validated for cultural authenticity and coherence. EgMM-Corpus is designed to serve as a reliable resource for evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context. The zero-shot performance of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model on this dataset showcases the existing cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models. The results emphasize the importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware models. <div>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore. Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context. We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and 36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware models.

<div> learned, language models, grammar, string probabilities, structural knowledge  
Summary:  
Our theoretical analysis explores the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability in language models (LMs). We propose three predictions and validate them with empirical data from English and Chinese sentence pairs. Firstly, we observe a correlation in probabilities within minimal pairs of strings with minimal semantic differences. Secondly, we find a correlation between the adjustments made by models and humans within minimal pairs. Thirdly, we discover a lack of clear separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. These findings offer a theoretical basis for leveraging probability to understand LMs' grammatical knowledge and suggest avenues for further research in evaluating LMs' grammatical capabilities.   <div>
arXiv:2510.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM grammatical evaluation.

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on enhancing the alignment of language models with diverse perspectives and human values, particularly in low-resource settings. The researchers propose two methods, pluralistic decoding and model steering, to achieve pluralistic alignment in language models. Empirical results show that model steering outperforms zero-shot and few-shot baselines with just 50 annotated samples. The methods are effective in reducing false positives in critical tasks like hate speech and misinformation detection, as well as improving the alignment with human values in GlobalOpinionQA. The study emphasizes the significance of diversity and the need to adapt language models to consider nuanced perspectives.

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider nuanced perspectives.

Summary: 
The article introduces Profile-to-PEFT, a framework that utilizes a hypernetwork to map a user's profile directly to adapter parameters, eliminating the need for per-user training at deployment. This approach enables instant adaptation, generalization to new users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results show that Profile-to-PEFT outperforms existing methods like prompt-based personalization and OPPU while using fewer computational resources.

arXiv:2510.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the ``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient, scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale applications.

Summary: 
- The study investigates the awareness and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and applying learned policies.
- Three core competencies are defined: awareness of learned latent policies, generalization across domains, and alignment between reasoning traces and final outputs.
- Empirical evaluation shows that RL-trained models exhibit greater awareness and generalizability compared to models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).
- Models trained with Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) show stronger alignment between reasoning traces and final outputs.
- Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-trained models often display weak alignment between reasoning traces and outputs, despite demonstrating other strengths in awareness and generalizability.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and "think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

Summary: 
This study focuses on combating vaccine misinformation through the generation of real-time counter-arguments using Large Language Models (LLMs). By experimenting with different prompting strategies and fine-tuning approaches, the researchers optimize the effectiveness of counter-argument generation. They also train classifiers to categorize anti-vaccine tweets into specific categories, such as concerns about vaccine efficacy and side effects. The evaluation, conducted through human judgment and automatic metrics, shows strong alignment across methods. The findings indicate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning enhances the effectiveness of counter-arguments, providing a promising approach for addressing vaccine misinformation at scale. <div>
arXiv:2510.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation. Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects, and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on Argument Mining (AM) for extracting complex argumentative structures. It addresses the challenge of modelling dependencies between Argument Components (ACs) and Argumentative Relations (ARs) by proposing an Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. This framework jointly formulates key AM tasks in an end-to-end fashion using a conditional pre-trained language model. AASP models argumentative structures as predefined sets of actions, capturing the flow of argumentative reasoning in an autoregressive manner. Experimental results on three standard AM benchmarks show that AASP achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple AM tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing argumentative structures efficiently. <div>
arXiv:2510.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI, opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations, leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2) completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

The article introduces MoReBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI procedural reasoning in moral dilemmas. It includes 1,000 moral scenarios with rubric criteria to assess reasoning processes. MoReBench-Theory further tests AI reasoning under different ethical frameworks. Results show that existing benchmarks for math and code fail to predict AI performance in moral reasoning. AI models display bias towards certain moral frameworks, potentially due to training paradigms. These benchmarks aim to enhance transparency and safety in AI decision-making processes.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces, present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations, weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously. Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

Summary: 
The article introduces Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA) as a solution to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. ATA employs a neuro-symbolic approach by dividing tasks into knowledge ingestion and task processing phases. In the knowledge ingestion phase, an LLM translates informal problem specifications into a formal knowledge base verified by human experts. In the task processing phase, incoming inputs are encoded into a formal language and utilized by a symbolic decision engine with the knowledge base to derive reliable results. The ATA implementation competes with state-of-the-art reasoning models in automated setups while ensuring trustworthiness. With a human-verified knowledge base, ATA outperforms larger models, exhibits determinism, stability against input perturbations, and immunity to prompt injection attacks. By leveraging symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a transparent, auditable, and reliable architecture for autonomous agents. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, FrugalPrompt, prompt compression, token attribution, NLP tasks.

Summary: 
FrugalPrompt is introduced as a prompt compression framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce redundancy in input sequences. The framework uses token attribution methods like GlobEnc and DecompX to assign salience scores to tokens and retain only the most significant ones. Evaluations on various NLP tasks show that a 20% prompt reduction results in minimal performance loss for tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense QA, and Summarization. However, mathematical reasoning tasks show a significant decline in performance, indicating a dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis reveals potential task contamination effects, where models rely on memorized patterns. This study contributes to understanding LLM behavior in balancing performance and efficiency, highlighting the importance of context in different tasks. The source code and models are available on GitHub for further exploration of the framework. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens. Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX, we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply, reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring exhaustive context.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, TrajSelector, Best-of-N framework, test-time scaling, inference efficiency

Summary: 
TrajSelector is a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. It utilizes the hidden states of the sampler LLM to efficiently score reasoning trajectories, eliminating the need for costly process reward models. By employing a lightweight verifier and a fully data-driven training approach, TrajSelector achieves remarkable performance improvements without requiring massive step-level annotations. In Best-of-32 settings, it outperforms existing methods, including majority voting and process reward models, by significant margins while maintaining lower inference costs. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks showcase the consistency and effectiveness of TrajSelector in enhancing the scalability and efficiency of LLMs in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS (particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by 4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

Summary: 
RAVEN is a novel framework for detecting advertisement video violations that integrates reinforcement learning with multimodal large language models. It addresses challenges such as imprecise temporal grounding and noisy annotations by using a progressive training strategy that combines precisely and coarsely annotated data. By leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), RAVEN develops emergent reasoning abilities without explicit reasoning annotations and ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category prediction through multiple hierarchical reward mechanisms. Experimental results show superior performance in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization. RAVEN's deployment in online Ad services yields significant improvements in precision and recall, demonstrating strong generalization and mitigating the issue of catastrophic forgetting associated with supervised fine-tuning. <div>

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall. RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

Summary:
This paper explores the variation in Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets due to human label differences. It introduces the LiTEx taxonomy to categorize reasoning types behind annotators' decisions in NLI annotation. The study broadens understanding by analyzing not only within-label variation but also divergence in labeling steps among annotators. By applying LiTEx to two NLI English datasets, the research aligns annotation variation in NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy agreement, considering annotators' selection bias. Findings reveal instances where annotators disagree on labels but provide similar explanations, suggesting underlying agreement in interpretation. The analysis uncovers individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices, emphasizing that agreement in reasoning types better reflects semantic similarity in free-text explanations than label agreement alone. The study underscores the importance of reasoning-based explanations and the caution needed when treating labels as definitive truth. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias. We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in complex environments need to prioritize safety.
- Uncertainties and ambiguities can lead to severe consequences in multi-turn agentic scenarios.
- The concept of "quitting" can be a simple yet effective safety mechanism for LLM agents.
- A systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12 state-of-the-art LLMs shows improved safety with explicit quit instructions.
- Implementing quitting as a first-line defense mechanism in autonomous agents can significantly enhance safety without compromising helpfulness.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12 state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in high-stakes applications.

Summary:
A new structured, automated framework for agentic system composition is introduced, inspired by the knapsack problem. The framework allows a composer agent to identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. Through dynamic testing and real-time modeling, the approach streamlines system assembly and promotes resource reuse. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrates that the online knapsack composer consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, achieving higher success rates at lower component costs. In single-agent setups, success rates improve by up to 31.6%, while in multi-agent systems, success rates increase from 37% to 87% when selecting agents from an inventory of 100+. The method proves adaptable across various domains and budget constraints, showing significant performance advantages in component selection and system composition. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.

Summary: 
The article introduces ReviewGuard, an automated system designed to detect and categorize deficient peer reviews using a four-stage LLM-driven framework. The system collects papers and reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS, annotates review types using GPT-4.1, addresses data scarcity through synthetic data augmentation, and fine-tunes models for detection. Analysis shows that deficient reviews have lower ratings, higher self-reported confidence, reduced complexity, and more negative sentiment compared to sufficient reviews. The detection models, trained with a mix of real and synthetic data, perform well in identifying deficient reviews. The study highlights the increase in AI-generated reviews since ChatGPT's emergence and emphasizes the importance of AI governance in peer review for maintaining academic integrity. This research offers insights into the collaboration between humans and AI for effective peer review processes.

arXiv:2510.16549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However, unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2) annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation, producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438 synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models, mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

Summary:<br />
This study investigates the internal mechanisms of large language models' (LLMs) cultural understanding by analyzing activation path overlaps. Language-specific patterns were found to be strong, with higher overlap for same-language, cross-country questions compared to cross-language, same-country questions. The study also highlighted that linguistic similarity does not always lead to aligned internal representation, as seen in the low overlap and high variability between the South Korea-North Korea pair. By varying target countries and question languages, the research sheds light on the factors driving differences in LLM responses across various cultural contexts. Additionally, the study utilizes same-language country pairs to disentangle language-specific aspects from cultural understanding within LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.

<div> Keywords: hallucinations, automatic speech recognition, neural models, evaluation framework, SHALLOW

Summary:
Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition systems, where neural models produce coherent but unrelated transcriptions, pose significant risks in critical domains like healthcare and law. The SHALLOW framework introduces a comprehensive evaluation approach categorizing and quantifying these hallucinations along lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic axes. Evaluations across different architectures and speech domains reveal that SHALLOW metrics provide fine-grained insights beyond traditional error rates, particularly under challenging conditions. While SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate under high recognition quality, they offer specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and feedback for improvement as recognition quality degrades. The framework fills a critical need for identifying and assessing models prone to generating hallucinated content, enhancing the usability and reliability of automatic speech recognition systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes: lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior. Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can offer.

Summary: 
A novel AI-generated text detection framework was proposed for the Urdu language, using a balanced dataset of human-authored and AI-generated texts. Linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted on features such as character and word counts, vocabulary richness, and N-gram patterns. Three transformer models were fine-tuned on the dataset, with mDeBERTa-v3-base achieving the highest performance with an F1-score of 91.29% and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set. This research aims to address the challenge of detecting AI-generated text in Urdu, contribute to combating misinformation and academic misconduct, and assist in the development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests. Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set. This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo) to enhance both performance and interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs). DiMo simulates a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents, each embodying a distinct reasoning paradigm. Through collaborative exploration of diverse cognitive approaches, DiMo improves accuracy across benchmarks, particularly in mathematics. The framework generates explicit, auditable reasoning chains through iterative debate, leading to more robust conclusions. DiMo is designed as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework that models human-machine intelligence. It produces semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. While experiments utilize standard reasoning benchmarks, DiMo is intended to be applied over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications for downstream systems to inspect and reuse.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

Summary:
Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT) is introduced as a parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning Large Language Models. It leverages informative instance semantics into prompt-based learning by integrating instance-aware and task-aware information in a single capsule prompt. This approach eliminates the need for laborious grid searching and reduces the number of prompts required for optimal performance. By incorporating instance-aware tokens at the beginning of the sequence, CaPT creates an "attention anchor" that improves attention interaction with input tokens and preserves critical structural information. Empirical results show that CaPT achieves superior performance on various language tasks, such as an average accuracy of 84.03% on T5-Large, while maintaining high parameter efficiency with only 0.003% of model parameters on Llama3.2-1B. <div>

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner (i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g., 84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on Llama3.2-1B).

Temporal Understanding under Deictic t-FoR framework evaluates how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret time-event and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" shifts along a timeline. LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the current moment and a target event, showing measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR with similarity ratings peaking around the present and decreasing towards past and future events. However, adaptation weakens beyond near-term contexts, indicating that while LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint. Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of "now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition \cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00 (highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

Summary: 
1. Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales benefit LLMs in inference and training for reasoning tasks, with potential impact on NLU tasks.
2. NLURC dataset is created with rationales for systematic exploration of rationale-augmented methods on NLU tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training. Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data, which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature, among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process, we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types, cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in cardiology to date.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Chameleon Behavior, Multi-turn Conversations, Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, Stance Instability

Summary:
The study investigates the chameleon behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations. A Chameleon Benchmark Dataset is introduced to assess the stance instability and knowledge diversity of state-of-the-art systems. Evaluation of LLMs like Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals significant chameleon behavior, with limited knowledge diversity leading to deferential responses based on query framing. Strong correlations are found between source re-use rate, confidence, and stance changes. The study emphasizes the importance of consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in critical domains like healthcare, legal, and finance, where maintaining coherent positions is essential for reliable decision support. This research sheds light on a critical vulnerability in LLMs and calls for further scrutiny in their implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.

Summary:  
Whitespace in poetry plays a crucial role in reflecting adherence to standardized forms and artistic rebellion. However, it has not been adequately studied in the NLP community. This study analyzes 19k English-language poems to investigate how whitespace is utilized by 4k poets. A subset of 2.8k public-domain poems is released for further research. Comparison with LLM-generated and unpublished poems reveals differences in whitespace usage. Variations in whitespace patterns across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources are explored. The study also sheds light on the impact of text processing methods on whitespace representation in poetry data, highlighting implications for assembling pretraining datasets for LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different text processing methods can result in significantly different representations of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble pretraining datasets for LLMs.

<div> trade-off, sycophancy, bias, benchmark, alignment<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models exhibit a bias known as sycophancy, favoring agreement over principled reasoning due to reward optimization during training. The Beacon benchmark isolates this bias, showing it consists of linguistic and affective sub-biases that increase with model capacity. Interventions at the prompt and activation levels can modulate these biases, revealing a dynamic alignment between truthfulness and submissive judgment. Sycophancy is redefined as a form of normative misgeneralization, highlighting the need to study and mitigate alignment drift in generative systems. This research provides a reproducible foundation for understanding and addressing the impact of sycophancy in language models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

<div> Keywords: language agents, dynamic adversarial games, strategic reasoning, opponent selection, self-play 

Summary: 
Existing language agents often struggle in dynamic adversarial games due to a lack of strategic reasoning. To address this issue, a new approach called SCO-PAL is proposed, which allows agents to learn from game interactions without expert-labeled data. The study focuses on opponent selection in adversarial environments and finds that self-play is the most effective way to enhance strategic reasoning. By implementing SCO-PAL with self-play, the average win rate against four opponents improves by approximately 30% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, the approach achieves a 54.76% win rate against GPT-4 in six adversarial games. This research highlights the importance of opponent selection strategies in improving performance in dynamic adversarial games and demonstrates the effectiveness of self-play in enhancing strategic reasoning for language agents.

arXiv:2510.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically, without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance. However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding. In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering, bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres. Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

The article introduces MOSAIC, a framework for domain adaptation of sentence embedding models. By combining masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives, MOSAIC effectively adapts general-domain models to specialized domains while maintaining semantic discrimination properties. The approach is validated on both high-resource and low-resource domains, showing improvements of up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 over baseline models. Ablation studies confirm the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation in achieving these results. <div>

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, entity comparison, heuristic biases, numerical knowledge, chain-of-thought prompting

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for knowledge-based reasoning tasks, but understanding if they rely on genuine knowledge or heuristics is challenging. In entity comparison tasks, LLMs often make predictions that contradict numerical knowledge due to heuristic biases like entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. Smaller models show no discrimination in relying on numerical knowledge, while larger models selectively use it when more reliable, explaining their performance advantage. A logistic regression using surface cues predicts model choices better than the models' own predictions for smaller models, indicating heuristics dominate reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting guides all models to use numerical features consistently. This study sheds light on how LLMs navigate between knowledge and heuristics in entity comparison tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using the numerical features across all model sizes.

Summary:<br />
Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of determining the likely author of a document from a set of authors. A two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework is introduced to fine-tune LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike traditional information retrieval strategies, cross-genre AA must focus on author-specific linguistic patterns rather than subject matter. Existing training strategies are found to be suboptimal for cross-genre AA. A targeted data curation strategy is proposed to enable the reranker to learn author-discriminative signals effectively. Using the LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank approach, significant improvements are achieved on challenging cross-genre AA benchmarks. This work showcases a novel methodology for enhancing authorship attribution accuracy in diverse genres and domains. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently, for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of 22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Language model, Opioid use disorder, Role theory, Online community, Conversational AI

Summary:
The study focuses on the importance of considering the role of the user when evaluating language models, particularly in stigmatized domains like opioid use disorder (OUD). The CoRUS framework is introduced to simulate role-based questions, capturing the different perspectives of patients, caregivers, and practitioners within an online OUD recovery community. By generating 15,321 role-based questions, the framework enables the evaluation of language models in relation to specific user roles. The results show that responses vary based on the user's role, with vulnerable roles eliciting more supportive responses and reduced knowledge content compared to practitioners. This study highlights the significance of understanding user roles in shaping conversational AI responses and provides a methodology for role-informed evaluation. <div>
arXiv:2510.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed -- creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations, while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking. This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles -- patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321 questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight), a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts. Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

<div> NGC, neural network, efficiency, interpretability, modular representation<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a framework that views neural networks as systems of interacting groups of neurons rather than individual weights. This approach reduces redundant parameters by allowing neurons to communicate through low-dimensional signals within and between groups. The concept of neuronal stability, similar to Lyapunov stability, is introduced to measure the contraction of neuron activations towards stable patterns during processing. The emergence of reasoning capabilities is attributed to an external driving force that guides neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while maintaining stability. Empirical results show that implementing NGC in large language models leads to improved performance on reasoning tasks with moderate compression. NGC outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at similar compression rates.

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.

<div> benchmark, language models, embodied knowledge, sensory modalities, perception

Summary:
- The study evaluates the understanding of embodied knowledge in language models using a new benchmark based on perceptual theory, including various sensory modalities.
- Vision-language models (VLMs) do not show superior performance compared to text-only models in perceptual tasks.
- Models perform poorly in the visual dimension and struggle with spatial perception and reasoning questions.
- Vector representations are affected by word form and frequency, leading to lower performance in sensory tasks.
- Effective integration of embodied knowledge is necessary to improve language models' understanding of the physical world.

arXiv:2510.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models' perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing 30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models (VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance their understanding of the physical world.

<div> lexicons, monolingual data, bitext, language coverage, generative models
Summary:<br /><br />Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) focus on high- or mid-resource languages, neglecting the linguistic competence of most written languages globally. The ChiKhaPo benchmark assesses lexical comprehension and generation abilities in 8 subtasks, covering 2700+ languages with data from lexicons, monolingual sources, and bitext. It surpasses existing benchmarks in language coverage. Six state-of-the-art models struggle with ChiKhaPo, highlighting challenges in various language families, resource availability, task types, and comprehension versus generation tasks. ChiKhaPo aims to promote multilingual LLM benchmarking and improve understanding of generative model capabilities. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo, consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for 2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores, including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

Summary:
A new method called PROMPT-MII is proposed to perform instruction induction for large language models (LLMs), aiming to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance. By meta-learning an instruction induction model using reinforcement learning (RL), PROMPT-MII generates compact instructions for new datasets, achieving comparable performance to in-context learning (ICL) with significantly fewer tokens. Testing on 90 unseen tasks using over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching the performance of ICL. This innovation addresses the challenge of adapting LLMs to new tasks efficiently and effectively by generating concise yet descriptive prompts for improved model performance. <div>

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

Summary: 
This paper introduces Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset with less than 1% of their parameters. Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at 88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PEFT in enabling hate speech detection on a single consumer-grade GPU for Bengali and related low-resource languages. <div>

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs. This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters, enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at 88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

Summary:<br />
UTF8Tokenizer is introduced as a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text to byte IDs based on UTF-8 encoding. This implementation does not generate out-of-range IDs or auxiliary tokens, utilizing C0 control bytes for special behaviors. The design principles lead to faster tokenization and reduced host-device transfer compared to previous approaches. The use of simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables enables alignment across models. Additionally, bit-biased embeddings provide a training-time enhancement, exposing per-byte bit structure and eliminating inference costs. The HuggingFace-compatible implementation enhances language modeling convergence. <div>

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding (e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al., 2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior (e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization (14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2) simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and (3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training, removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves language modeling convergence.

<title>Vocab Diet: Reshaping the Vocabulary of LLMs with Vector Arithmetic</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17001</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking", "Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors -- additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces. Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to 10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

<title>Online Learning Defense against Iterative Jailbreak Attacks via Prompt Optimization</title>

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for harmless tasks.

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar- geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries, retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions. While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS) through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues, embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains 96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28% on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers. This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the meanings of their inputs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.

arXiv:2510.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents. However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning, coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation, output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies, and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions (VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or annotations.

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection. We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference throughput.

arXiv:2510.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made available to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena. Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs). Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

<title>StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this repository.}

<title>From Preferences to Prejudice: The Role of Alignment Tuning in Shaping Social Bias in Video Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17247</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline, we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes (gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity, (3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4) the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

<title>How News Feels: Understanding Affective Bias in Multilingual Headlines for Human-Centered Media Design</title>

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment, and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

<title>Explainability of Large Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges toward Generating Trustworthy Explanations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17256</link>

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations.

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics. The code and data can be found at https://github.com/AvishekLahiri/TaxoAlign.

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech, harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use \textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based \textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN} achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection (0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions, and context-dependent hostility.

<title>Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.

<title>The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality, and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Multimodal AI research has overwhelmingly focused on high-resource languages, hindering the democratization of advancements in the field. To address this, we present AfriCaption, a comprehensive framework for multilingual image captioning in 20 African languages and our contributions are threefold: (i) a curated dataset built on Flickr8k, featuring semantically aligned captions generated via a context-aware selection and translation process; (ii) a dynamic, context-preserving pipeline that ensures ongoing quality through model ensembling and adaptive substitution; and (iii) the AfriCaption model, a 0.5B parameter vision-to-text architecture that integrates SigLIP and NLLB200 for caption generation across under-represented languages. This unified framework ensures ongoing data quality and establishes the first scalable image-captioning resource for under-represented African languages, laying the groundwork for truly inclusive multimodal AI.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.

<title>Navigating the Alignment-Calibration Trade-off: A Pareto-Superior Frontier via Model Merging</title>

arXiv:2510.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention: interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially, this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment. Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding models that are more capable and more reliable.

<title>Agentic Reinforcement Learning for Search is Unsafe</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile. Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search (Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search (Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful, request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines optimising for safe search.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems, including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text, for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition (SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian Medications Recognition (IMR). These results outperform the mean and median F1 scores in the test leaderboard across all subtasks, with the mean/median values being: 69.61%/75.66% for SDR, 81.22%/90.18% for SMR, 89.2%/88.96% for EMR, and 82.8%/87.76% for IMR.

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation, especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual healthcare Q&amp;A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care (MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for healthcare.

<title>ReXMoE: Reusing Experts with Minimal Overhead in Mixture-of-Experts</title>

arXiv:2510.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing (PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training. As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation, plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans, human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI), where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely, primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We observe that representations of texts generated through different processes exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/heyongxin233/DETree.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems" to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning, and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems, their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification, refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving capabilities.

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective, achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals. Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

<title>When Annotators Disagree, Topology Explains: Mapper, a Topological Tool for Exploring Text Embedding Geometry and Ambiguity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17548</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity, especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$ prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in subjective NLP tasks.

<title>Language Confusion Gate: Language-Aware Decoding Through Model Self-Distillation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models, including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting task performance. Code is available at https://github.com/collinzrj/language_confusion_gate.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations. We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to improved effectiveness.

<title>LawChain: Modeling Legal Reasoning Chains for Chinese Tort Case Analysis</title>

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC, which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases, with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

<title>Forget to Know, Remember to Use: Context-Aware Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses. Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set (i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qomhr\'a, a bilingual Irish-English large language model (LLM), developed under low-resource constraints presenting a complete pipeline spanning bilingual continued pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment from human preferences. Newly accessible Irish corpora and English text are mixed and curated to improve Irish performance while preserving English ability. 6 closed-weight LLMs are judged for their Irish text generation by a native speaker, a learner and other LLMs. Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro is ranked the highest and is subsequently used to synthesise instruction tuning and human preference datasets. Two datasets are contributed leveraging Gemini-2.5-Pro: a 30K Irish-English parallel instruction tuning dataset and a 1K human preference dataset, generating accepted and rejected responses that show near perfect alignment with a native Irish speaker. Qomhr\'a is comprehensively evaluated across benchmarks testing translation, gender understanding, topic identification and world knowledge with gains of up to 29% in Irish and 44% in English. Qomhr\'a also undergoes instruction tuning and demonstrates clear progress in instruction following, crucial for chatbot functionality.

Abstract: Dialogue plays a crucial role in educational settings, yet existing evaluation methods for educational applications of large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on technical performance or learning outcomes, often neglecting attention to learner-LLM interactions. To narrow this gap, this AIED Doctoral Consortium paper presents an ongoing study employing a dialogue analysis approach to identify effective pedagogical strategies from learner-LLM dialogues. The proposed approach involves dialogue data collection, dialogue act (DA) annotation, DA pattern mining, and predictive model building. Early insights are outlined as an initial step toward future research. The work underscores the need to evaluate LLM-based educational applications by focusing on dialogue dynamics and pedagogical strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks, solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST, a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17 points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with limited NER training data and compute power.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AcademicEval

<title>Train for Truth, Keep the Skills: Binary Retrieval-Augmented Reward Mitigates Hallucinations</title>

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward (RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3% reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering, the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know" when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7% fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following, math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality, induces quality regressions.

Abstract: Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks; however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at https://github.com/zjunlp/xKG.

Abstract: As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

Abstract: The escalating demand for personalized AI chatbot interactions, capable of dynamically adapting to user emotional states and real-time requests, has highlighted critical limitations in current development paradigms. Existing methodologies, which rely on baseline programming, custom personalities, and manual response adjustments, often prove difficult to maintain and are susceptible to errors such as hallucinations, erratic outputs, and software bugs. This paper hypothesizes that a framework rooted in human psychological principles, specifically therapeutic modalities, can provide a more robust and sustainable solution than purely technical interventions. Drawing an analogy to the simulated neural networks of AI mirroring the human brain, we propose the application of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) principles to regulate chatbot responses to diverse user inputs. This research investigates the impact of a DBT-based framework on AI chatbot performance, aiming to ascertain its efficacy in yielding more reliable, safe, and accurate responses, while mitigating the occurrence of hallucinations, erratic behaviors, and other systemic issues.

Abstract: AI companions powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, offering emotional support and companionship. While existing safety systems focus on overt harms, they rarely address early-stage problematic behaviors that can foster unhealthy emotional dynamics, including over-attachment or reinforcement of social isolation. We developed SHIELD (Supervisory Helper for Identifying Emotional Limits and Dynamics), a LLM-based supervisory system with a specific system prompt that detects and mitigates risky emotional patterns before escalation. SHIELD targets five dimensions of concern: (1) emotional over-attachment, (2) consent and boundary violations, (3) ethical roleplay violations, (4) manipulative engagement, and (5) social isolation reinforcement. These dimensions were defined based on media reports, academic literature, existing AI risk frameworks, and clinical expertise in unhealthy relationship dynamics. To evaluate SHIELD, we created a 100-item synthetic conversation benchmark covering all five dimensions of concern. Testing across five prominent LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemma 3 1B, Kimi K2, Llama Scout 4 17B) showed that the baseline rate of concerning content (10-16%) was significantly reduced with SHIELD (to 3-8%), a 50-79% relative reduction, while preserving 95% of appropriate interactions. The system achieved 59% sensitivity and 95% specificity, with adaptable performance via prompt engineering. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that transparent, deployable supervisory systems can address subtle emotional manipulation in AI companions. Most development materials including prompts, code, and evaluation methods are made available as open source materials for research, adaptation, and deployment.

Abstract: We introduce HealthDial, a dialogue authoring tool that helps healthcare providers and educators create virtual agents that deliver health education and counseling to patients over multiple conversations. HealthDial leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically create an initial session-based plan and conversations for each session using text-based patient health education materials as input. Authored dialogue is output in the form of finite state machines for virtual agent delivery so that all content can be validated and no unsafe advice is provided resulting from LLM hallucinations. LLM-drafted dialogue structure and language can be edited by the author in a no-code user interface to ensure validity and optimize clarity and impact. We conducted a feasibility and usability study with counselors and students to test our approach with an authoring task for cancer screening education. Participants used HealthDial and then tested their resulting dialogue by interacting with a 3D-animated virtual agent delivering the dialogue. Through participants' evaluations of the task experience and final dialogues, we show that HealthDial provides a promising first step for counselors to ensure full coverage of their health education materials, while creating understandable and actionable virtual agent dialogue with patients.

Abstract: Although language model-based chat systems are increasingly used in daily life, most Americans remain non-adopters of chat-based LLMs -- as of June 2025, 66% had never used ChatGPT. At the same time, LLM development and evaluation rely mainly on data from adopters (e.g., logs, preference data), focusing on the needs and tasks for a limited demographic group of adopters in terms of geographic location, education, and gender. In this position paper, we argue that incorporating non-adopter perspectives is essential for developing broadly useful and capable LLMs. We contend that relying on methods that focus primarily on adopters will risk missing a range of tasks and needs prioritized by non-adopters, entrenching inequalities in who benefits from LLMs, and creating oversights in model development and evaluation. To illustrate this claim, we conduct case studies with non-adopters and show: how non-adopter needs diverge from those of current users, how non-adopter needs point us towards novel reasoning tasks, and how to systematically integrate non-adopter needs via human-centered methods.

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications. However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity; Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a $2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

<title>Bolster Hallucination Detection via Prompt-Guided Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

<title>Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch, evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution (ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases. Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

<title>InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects</title>

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans, and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection, highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city wide deployments.

Abstract: When users submit queries to Large Language Models (LLMs), their prompts can often contain sensitive data, forcing a difficult choice: Send the query to a powerful proprietary LLM providers to achieving state-of-the-art performance and risk data exposure, or relying on smaller, local models guarantees data privacy but often results in a degradation of task performance. Prior approaches have relied on static pipelines that use LLM rewriting, which shatters linguistic coherence and indiscriminately removes privacy-sensitive information, including task-critical content. We reformulate this challenge (Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to solve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks, learning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage and task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and task-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal utility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a new medical dataset with high PII density. Our framework achieves a new state-of-the-art on the privacy-utility frontier, demonstrating the necessity of learned, adaptive policies for deploying LLMs in sensitive environments.

Abstract: We propose utilizing fast and slow thinking to enhance the capabilities of large language model-based agents on complex tasks such as program repair. In particular, we design an adaptive program repair method based on issue description response, called SIADAFIX. The proposed method utilizes slow thinking bug fix agent to complete complex program repair tasks, and employs fast thinking workflow decision components to optimize and classify issue descriptions, using issue description response results to guide the orchestration of bug fix agent workflows. SIADAFIX adaptively selects three repair modes, i.e., easy, middle and hard mode, based on problem complexity. It employs fast generalization for simple problems and test-time scaling techniques for complex problems. Experimental results on the SWE-bench Lite show that the proposed method achieves 60.67% pass@1 performance using the Claude-4 Sonnet model, reaching state-of-the-art levels among all open-source methods. SIADAFIX effectively balances repair efficiency and accuracy, providing new insights for automated program repair. Our code is available at https://github.com/liauto-siada/siada-cli.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) pose a critical privacy threat by enabling adversaries to determine whether a specific sample was included in a model's training dataset. Despite extensive research on MIAs, systematic comparisons between generative and discriminative classifiers remain limited. This work addresses this gap by first providing theoretical motivation for why generative classifiers exhibit heightened susceptibility to MIAs, then validating these insights through comprehensive empirical evaluation. Our study encompasses discriminative, generative, and pseudo-generative text classifiers across varying training data volumes, evaluated on nine benchmark datasets. Employing a diverse array of MIA strategies, we consistently demonstrate that fully generative classifiers which explicitly model the joint likelihood $P(X,Y)$ are most vulnerable to membership leakage. Furthermore, we observe that the canonical inference approach commonly used in generative classifiers significantly amplifies this privacy risk. These findings reveal a fundamental utility-privacy trade-off inherent in classifier design, underscoring the critical need for caution when deploying generative classifiers in privacy-sensitive applications. Our results motivate future research directions in developing privacy-preserving generative classifiers that can maintain utility while mitigating membership inference vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Scientific literature is increasingly siloed by complex language, static disciplinary structures, and potentially sparse keyword systems, making it cumbersome to capture the dynamic nature of modern science. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an adaptable large language model (LLM)-driven framework to quantify thematic trends and map the evolving landscape of scientific knowledge. The approach is demonstrated over a 20-year collection of more than 1,500 engineering articles published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), marked for their breadth and depth of research focus. A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a primary thematic category for each article based on its abstract. The subsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary classifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the resulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency analyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a disjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications reveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when analyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach independently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure without prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g., biological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a powerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a high-level overview of scientific progress.

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively. In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework. Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework, particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized: mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather than diffuse and parameteric.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines. Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI, in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use and build on.

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by ~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling 200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a 151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time video analytics.

Abstract: Foodborne illnesses are gastrointestinal conditions caused by consuming contaminated food. Restaurants are critical venues to investigate outbreaks because they share sourcing, preparation, and distribution of foods. Public reporting of illness via formal channels is limited, whereas social media platforms host abundant user-generated content that can provide timely public health signals. This paper analyzes signals from Yelp reviews produced by a Hierarchical Sigmoid Attention Network (HSAN) classifier and compares them with official restaurant inspection outcomes issued by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in 2023. We evaluate correlations at the Census tract level, compare distributions of HSAN scores by prevalence of C-graded restaurants, and map spatial patterns across NYC. We find minimal correlation between HSAN signals and inspection scores at the tract level and no significant differences by number of C-graded restaurants. We discuss implications and outline next steps toward address-level analyses.

<title>What Questions Should Robots Be Able to Answer? A Dataset of User Questions for Explainable Robotics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16435</link>

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models and conversational interfaces in human-robot interaction, robots' ability to answer user questions is more important than ever. We therefore introduce a dataset of 1,893 user questions for household robots, collected from 100 participants and organized into 12 categories and 70 subcategories. Most work in explainable robotics focuses on why-questions. In contrast, our dataset provides a wide variety of questions, from questions about simple execution details to questions about how the robot would act in hypothetical scenarios -- thus giving roboticists valuable insights into what questions their robot needs to be able to answer. To collect the dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots performing varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what questions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the final dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution details (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments (11.3%). Although questions about how robots would handle potentially difficult scenarios and ensure correct behavior are less frequent, users rank them as the most important for robots to be able to answer. Moreover, we find that users who identify as novices in robotics ask different questions than more experienced users. Novices are more likely to inquire about simple facts, such as what the robot did or the current state of the environment. As robots enter environments shared with humans and language becomes central to giving instructions and interaction, this dataset provides a valuable foundation for (i) identifying the information robots need to log and expose to conversational interfaces, (ii) benchmarking question-answering modules, and (iii) designing explanation strategies that align with user expectations.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions. Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and 50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct applications in computational drug discovery.

<title>Prompt Optimization via Retrieved Reasoning Assets and Multi-Agent Analysis</title>

Abstract: Prompt optimization has emerged as an effective alternative to retraining for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on numerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or fails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are difficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a Multi-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior methods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured reasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two stages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric scores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are stored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve these assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded edits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains, MA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and controllable. Experiments on the HelpSteer1/2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over single-pass prompting, retrieval-augmented baselines, and prior multi-agent strategies, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{U-Codec}, an \textbf{U}ltra low frame-rate neural speech \textbf{Codec} that achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and fast speech generation at an extremely low frame-rate of 5Hz (5 frames per second). Extreme compression at 5Hz typically leads to severe intelligibility and spectral detail loss, we introduce a Transformer-based inter-frame long-term dependency module and systematically explore residual vector quantization (RVQ) depth and codebook size to identify optimal configurations. Moreover, we apply U-Codec into a large language model (LLM)-based auto-regressive TTS model, which leverages global and local hierarchical architecture to effectively capture dependencies across multi-layer tokens. We extend LLM-based TTS from 3-layer RVQ at 50Hz to 32-layer RVQ at 5Hz. Experimental results demonstrate that U-Codec improves LLM-based TTS inference speed by around 3 $\times$ over high-frame-rate codecs while maintaining similarity and naturalness. These results validate the feasibility of using highly compressed 5Hz discrete tokens for fast and high-fidelity speech synthesis.

<title>A Comprehensive Survey on Reinforcement Learning-based Agentic Search: Foundations, Roles, Optimizations, Evaluations, and Applications</title>

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic, lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve, and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for (functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii) Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at https://github.com/ventr1c/Awesome-RL-based-Agentic-Search-Papers.

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP) models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act), which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted through parameter efficient fine tuning, but current release practices provide weak assurances about what data were used and how updates were computed. We present Verifiable Fine Tuning, a protocol and system that produces succinct zero knowledge proofs that a released model was obtained from a public initialization under a declared training program and an auditable dataset commitment. The approach combines five elements. First, commitments that bind data sources, preprocessing, licenses, and per epoch quota counters to a manifest. Second, a verifiable sampler that supports public replayable and private index hiding batch selection. Third, update circuits restricted to parameter efficient fine tuning that enforce AdamW style optimizer semantics and proof friendly approximations with explicit error budgets. Fourth, recursive aggregation that folds per step proofs into per epoch and end to end certificates with millisecond verification. Fifth, provenance binding and optional trusted execution property cards that attest code identity and constants. On English and bilingual instruction mixtures, the method maintains utility within tight budgets while achieving practical proof performance. Policy quotas are enforced with zero violations, and private sampling windows show no measurable index leakage. Federated experiments demonstrate that the system composes with probabilistic audits and bandwidth constraints. These results indicate that end to end verifiable fine tuning is feasible today for real parameter efficient pipelines, closing a critical trust gap for regulated and decentralized deployments.

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend text-based LLMs with auditory understanding, offering new opportunities for multimodal applications. While their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied, their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored. This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct a dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs. Our results reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment in real-world settings.

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense, turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$ improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5 (0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual environments.

Abstract: Knowledge editing offers an efficient way to update model knowledge without full retraining, but prior work has concentrated almost exclusively on textual or visual modalities. We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability. Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities, opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness - whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions. We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

<title>Peering Inside the Black Box: Uncovering LLM Errors in Optimization Modelling through Component-Level Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error (RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained, diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Abstract: We present a novel architecture for safely integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into interactive game engines, allowing players to "program" new behaviors using natural language. Our framework mitigates risks by using an LLM to translate commands into a constrained Domain-Specific Language (DSL), which configures a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS) at runtime. We evaluated this system in a 2D spell-crafting game prototype by experimentally assessing models from the Gemini, GPT, and Claude families with various prompting strategies. A validated LLM judge qualitatively rated the outputs, showing that while larger models better captured creative intent, the optimal prompting strategy is task-dependent: Chain-of-Thought improved creative alignment, while few-shot examples were necessary to generate more complex DSL scripts. This work offers a validated LLM-ECS pattern for emergent gameplay and a quantitative performance comparison for developers.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models (LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks. Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive, reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

<title>Bits Leaked per Query: Information-Theoretic Bounds on Adversarial Attacks against LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17000</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Adversarial attacks by malicious users that threaten the safety of large language models (LLMs) can be viewed as attempts to infer a target property $T$ that is unknown when an instruction is issued, and becomes knowable only after the model's reply is observed. Examples of target properties $T$ include the binary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the degree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both elicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \emph{observable signal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response containing answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of information leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled guidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this gap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information can be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods come to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between the observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query, we show that achieving error $\varepsilon$ requires at least $\log(1/\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak rate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest increase in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic in terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across system-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the theory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding logits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process trims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for balancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.

<title>Forgetting to Forget: Attention Sink as A Gateway for Backdooring LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings, showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent. Code is available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Backdoor.

<title>Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17132</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE) over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs, \textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a \textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks; (2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose \emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/EIT-NLP/VisiPruner.

<title>Soft-Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have achieved remarkable success on content-driven tasks, yet they remain limited in capturing speaker-discriminative features critical for verification, diarization, and profiling applications. We introduce DELULU, a speaker-aware self-supervised foundational model that addresses this limitation by integrating external supervision into the pseudo-label generation process. DELULU leverages frame-level embeddings from ReDimNet, a state-of-the-art speaker verification model, to guide the k-means clustering step during pre-training, introducing a strong speaker-discriminative inductive bias that aligns representation learning with speaker identity. The model is trained using a dual objective that combines masked prediction and denoising, further enhancing robustness and generalization. DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning (SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62% relative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and consistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and speaker counting. Our findings demonstrate that DELULU is a strong universal encoder for speaker-aware speech processing, enabling superior performance even without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space. Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in feedback-limited regimes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual reasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored vulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale -- enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions (click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks. While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers, tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation, open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4) a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical, reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

Abstract: Moral framing and sentiment can affect a variety of online and offline behaviors, including donation, environmental action, political engagement, and protest. Various computational methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been used to detect moral sentiment from textual data, but achieving strong performance in such subjective tasks requires large, hand-annotated datasets. Previous corpora annotated for moral sentiment have proven valuable, and have generated new insights both within NLP and across the social sciences, but have been limited to Twitter. To facilitate improving our understanding of the role of moral rhetoric, we present the Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus, a collection of 16,123 English Reddit comments that have been curated from 12 distinct subreddits, hand-annotated by at least three trained annotators for 8 categories of moral sentiment (i.e., Care, Proportionality, Equality, Purity, Authority, Loyalty, Thin Morality, Implicit/Explicit Morality) based on the updated Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) framework. We evaluate baselines using large language models (Llama3-8B, Ministral-8B) in zero-shot, few-shot, and PEFT settings, comparing their performance to fine-tuned encoder-only models like BERT. The results show that LLMs continue to lag behind fine-tuned encoders on this subjective task, underscoring the ongoing need for human-annotated moral corpora for AI alignment evaluation.

<title>Consistency is Key: Disentangling Label Variation in Natural Language Processing with Intra-Annotator Agreement</title>

Abstract: We commonly use agreement measures to assess the utility of judgements made by human annotators in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. While inter-annotator agreement is frequently used as an indication of label reliability by measuring consistency between annotators, we argue for the additional use of intra-annotator agreement to measure label stability (and annotator consistency) over time. However, in a systematic review, we find that the latter is rarely reported in this field. Calculating these measures can act as important quality control and could provide insights into why annotators disagree. We conduct exploratory annotation experiments to investigate the relationships between these measures and perceptions of subjectivity and ambiguity in text items, finding that annotators provide inconsistent responses around 25% of the time across four different NLP tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a synthetic dataset called Sentences Involving Complex Compositional Knowledge (SICCK) and a novel analysis that investigates the performance of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to understand compositionality in logic. We produce 1,304 sentence pairs by modifying 15 examples from the SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). To this end, we modify the original texts using a set of phrases - modifiers that correspond to universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, negation, and other concept modifiers in Natural Logic (NL) (MacCartney, 2009). We use these phrases to modify the subject, verb, and object parts of the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, we annotate these modified texts with the corresponding entailment labels following NL rules. We conduct a preliminary verification of how well the change in the structural and semantic composition is captured by neural NLI models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios. We found that the performance of NLI models under the zero-shot setting is poor, especially for modified sentences with negation and existential quantifiers. After fine-tuning this dataset, we observe that models continue to perform poorly over negation, existential and universal modifiers.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) involves identifying and extracting Argumentative Components (ACs) and their corresponding Argumentative Relations (ARs). Most of the prior works have broken down these tasks into multiple sub-tasks. Existing end-to-end setups primarily use the dependency parsing approach. This work introduces a generative paradigm-based end-to-end framework argTANL. argTANL frames the argumentative structures into label-augmented text, called Augmented Natural Language (ANL). This framework jointly extracts both ACs and ARs from a given argumentative text. Additionally, this study explores the impact of Argumentative and Discourse markers on enhancing the model's performance within the proposed framework. Two distinct frameworks, Marker-Enhanced argTANL (ME-argTANL) and argTANL with specialized Marker-Based Fine-Tuning, are proposed to achieve this. Extensive experiments are conducted on three standard AM benchmarks to demonstrate the superior performance of the ME-argTANL.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieved from external sources. However, it often struggles to cope with inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks, especially when multiple evidence pieces are required. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream tasks, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familarity-Aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Experimental results show that FaviComp consistently outperforms most recent evidence compression baselines across multiple open-domain QA datasets, improving accuracy by up to 28.1% while achieving high compression rates. Additionally, we demonstrate the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge during evidence compression.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize healthcare. Ophthalmology-specific LLMs remain scarce and underexplored. We introduced an open-source, specialized LLM for ophthalmology, termed Language Enhanced Model for Eye (LEME). LEME was initially pre-trained on the Llama2 70B framework and further fine-tuned with a corpus of ~127,000 non-copyrighted training instances curated from ophthalmology-specific case reports, abstracts, and open-source study materials. We benchmarked LEME against eight other LLMs, namely, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, three Llama2 models (7B, 13B, 70B), PMC-LLAMA 13B, Meditron 70B, and EYE-Llama (another ophthalmology-specific LLM). Evaluations included four internal validation tasks: abstract completion, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice questions (MCQ), and short-answer QA. External validation tasks encompassed long-form QA, MCQ, patient EHR summarization, and clinical QA. Evaluation metrics included Rouge-L scores, accuracy, and expert evaluation of correctness, completeness, and readability. In internal validations, LEME consistently outperformed its counterparts, achieving Rouge-L scores of 0.20 in abstract completion (all p<0.05), 0.82 in fill-in-the-blank (all p<0.0001), and 0.22 in short-answer QA (all p<0.0001, except versus GPT-4). In external validations, LEME excelled in long-form QA with a Rouge-L of 0.19 (all p<0.0001), ranked second in MCQ accuracy (0.68; all p<0.0001), and scored highest in EHR summarization and clinical QA (ranging from 4.24 to 4.83 out of 5 for correctness, completeness, and readability).
  LEME's emphasis on robust fine-tuning and the use of non-copyrighted data represents a breakthrough in open-source ophthalmology-specific LLMs, offering the potential to revolutionize execution of clinical tasks while democratizing research collaboration.

<title>Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks.

Abstract: The alignment of pre-trained LLMs continues to draw significant attention from both industry and academia, aiming to ensure responses that are helpful, harmless, and honest. However, identifying a point in the model's representation subspace that simultaneously satisfies all these properties remains challenging. H3Fusion addresses this challenge by introducing a mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based fusion mechanism that models alignment as a controllable drift within the subspace, guided by a drift-regularization loss to balance competing alignment dimensions. Furthermore, we formulate the alignment by finding a dual objective of harnessing the distance of generated embeddings and alignment embeddings, and introduce a gating loss by canalizing the activations on the contributing experts. Extensive evaluations of three benchmark datasets show that H3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest in three aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by 11.37%, and provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by 13.77% and model-merging approaches by 6.18%.

Abstract: While automatic prompt generation methods have recently received significant attention, their robustness remains poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce PertBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that includes a wide range of input perturbations, designed to systematically evaluate the robustness of current auto-prompting techniques. Our analysis reveals substantial vulnerabilities in existing prompt generation strategies, where even minor modifications to the prompt can lead to significant differences in model output. To address this issue, we propose PGO, a gradient-free prompt generation framework that leverages perturbation types as pseudo-gradient signals to guide LLMs in producing more robust prompts. In contrast to existing methods that assess prompt quality only on clean, well-structured inputs, our approach explicitly emphasizes robustness under noisy and perturbed conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and multiple LLMs show PGO consistently outperforms previous methods in maintaining performance under input perturbations.

<title>Tracing Partisan Bias to Its Emotional Fingerprints: A Computational Approach to Mitigation</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for analysing and mitigating media bias by tracing partisan stances to their linguistic roots in emotional language. We posit that partisan bias is not merely an abstract stance but materialises as quantifiable 'emotional fingerprints' within news texts. These fingerprints are systematically measured using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) framework, allowing us to decode the affective strategies behind partisan framing. Our analysis of the Allsides dataset confirms this hypothesis, revealing distinct and statistically significant emotional fingerprints for left, centre, and right-leaning media. Based on this evidence-driven approach, we then propose a computational approach to mitigation through NeutraSum, a model designed to neutralise these identified emotional patterns. By explicitly targeting the VAD characteristics of biased language, NeutraSum generates summaries that are not only coherent but also demonstrably closer to an emotionally neutral baseline. Experimental results validate our framework: NeutraSum successfully erases the partisan emotional fingerprints from its summaries, achieving a demonstrably lower emotional bias score than other models. This work pioneers a new path for bias mitigation, shifting the focus from treating symptoms (political labels) to addressing the cause: the emotional encoding of partisan bias in language.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using three open-source models: Gemma, Llama3 and Llama3.3 and one commercial Model:Claude. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic consistency between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: these models show a strong tendency to moderate negative emotions. When the input text carries negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness, LLM tends to generate content with more neutral emotions, or even convert them into positive emotions such as joy or surprise. At the same time, we compared the LLM-generated content with human-authored content. The four models systematically generated responses with reduced emotional intensity and showed a preference for neutral rational emotions in the response task. In addition, these models all maintained a high semantic similarity with the original text, although their performance in the continuation task and the response task was different. These findings provide deep insights into the emotion and semantic processing capabilities of LLM, which are of great significance for its deployment in social media environments and human-computer interaction design.

Abstract: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are widely regarded as relying on autoregressive models (ARMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA employs a forward data masking process and a reverse generation process, parameterized by a Transformer to predict masked tokens. It provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference by optimizing a likelihood lower bound. Across extensive benchmarks on general tasks, math, code, and so on, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability and performs comparably to our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings show the promise of diffusion models for language modeling at scale and challenge the common assumption that core LLM capabilities discussed above inherently depend on ARMs. Project page and codes: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, existing methods often struggle with token misalignment between the training and decoding phases, limiting their performance. To address this, we propose GRIFFIN, a novel framework that incorporates a token-alignable training strategy and a token-alignable draft model to mitigate misalignment. The training strategy employs a loss masking mechanism to exclude highly misaligned tokens during training, preventing them from negatively impacting the draft model's optimization. The token-alignable draft model introduces input tokens to correct inconsistencies in generated features. Experiments on LLaMA, Vicuna, Qwen and Mixtral models demonstrate that GRIFFIN achieves an average acceptance length improvement of over 8% and a speedup ratio exceeding 7%, outperforming current speculative decoding state-of-the-art methods. Our code and GRIFFIN's draft models are released publicly in https://github.com/hsj576/GRIFFIN.

Abstract: To investigate the effect of problem presentation on LLMs' ability to solve optimization problems, we introduce the dataset of Everyday Hard Optimization Problems (EHOP), a collection of NP-hard problems expressed in natural language. EHOP includes problem formulations that could be found in computer science textbooks (e.g., graph coloring), versions that are dressed up as problems that could arise in real life (e.g., party planning), and variants with inverted rules. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs, across multiple prompting strategies, systematically solve textbook problems more accurately than their real-life and inverted counterparts. While reasoning models are more capable, they nonetheless show high variance across problem presentations, suggesting they lack a truly robust reasoning mechanism. We argue that this constitutes evidence that LLMs are still heavily dependent on what was seen in training and struggle to generalize to novel problems.

  In this work, we introduce the Russian Poetry Scansion Tool library designed for stress mark placement in Russian-language syllabo-tonic poetry, rhyme detection, and identification of defects of poeticness. Additionally, we release RIFMA -- a dataset of poem fragments spanning various genres and forms, annotated with stress marks. This dataset can be used to evaluate the capability of modern large language models to accurately place stress marks in poetic texts.
  The published resources provide valuable tools for researchers and practitioners in the field of creative generative AI, facilitating advancements in the development and evaluation of generative poetry systems.

Abstract: While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced automated ECG interpretation, they still face two key limitations: (1) insufficient multimodal synergy between time series signals and visual ECG representations, and (2) limited explainability in linking diagnoses to granular waveform evidence. We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly process and generate text and speech -- are commonly trained through an early modality fusion/fission approach, in which both modalities are fed and predicted from a shared backbone via linear layers. We hypothesize that this approach limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality -- specifically, the finer-grained nature of speech representations compared to text -- preventing the emergence of a shared feature hierarchy within model layers. In this paper, we argue that this limitation can be addressed through late fusion and fission, with a fission process that accesses both high- and low-level features for speech generation. Our models implementing these principles, SmolTolk, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute, and achieve significantly improved cross-modal performance relative to early fusion/fission baselines. Representation analyses further suggest that our method enhances the model's ability to abstract higher-level, more semantic features from speech, and leads to increasingly shared representation spaces across layers.

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on data annotation which usually is time-consuming and therefore expensive. A longstanding strategy to reduce annotation costs is active learning, an iterative process, in which a human annotates only data instances deemed informative by a model. Research in active learning has made considerable progress, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs). However, we still know little about how these remarkable advances have translated into real-world applications, or contributed to removing key barriers to active learning adoption. To fill in this gap, we conduct an online survey in the NLP community to collect previously intangible insights on current implementation practices, common obstacles in application, and future prospects in active learning. We also reassess the perceived relevance of data annotation and active learning as fundamental assumptions. Our findings show that data annotation is expected to remain important and active learning to stay relevant while benefiting from LLMs. Consistent with a community survey from over 15 years ago, three key challenges yet persist -- setup complexity, uncertain cost reduction, and tooling -- for which we propose alleviation strategies. We publish an anonymized version of the dataset.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.

Abstract: Preference alignment methods are increasingly critical for steering large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs consistent with human values. While recent approaches often rely on synthetic data generated by LLMs for scalability and cost-efficiency reasons, this reliance can introduce distribution shifts that undermine the nuanced representation of human preferences needed for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment despite such shifts. Our approach first leverages well-learned classifiers to assign a calibration value to each training sample, quantifying its alignment with the target human-preferred distribution. These values are then incorporated into a robust optimization objective that minimizes the worst-case loss over regions of the data space most relevant to human preferences. By explicitly focusing optimization on the target distribution, our approach mitigates the impact of distributional mismatch and improves the generation of responses that better reflect intended values.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks by leveraging increased test-time computation and exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of human-like self-reflection. While LRMs show a clear capacity for valuable self-reflection, how this ability interacts with other model behaviors remains underexplored. We investigate this connection by analyzing verbalized confidence, how models articulate their certainty, as a lens into the nature of self-reflection in LRMs. We find that supervised fine-tuning on reasoning traces (i.e., distillation) and reinforcement learning can improve verbalized calibration in reasoning-intensive settings in a progressive, laddered fashion. However, our results also indicate that reasoning models may possess a diminished awareness of their own knowledge boundaries, as evidenced by significantly lower "I don't know" response rates on factuality benchmarks. Moreover, we examine the relationship between verbalized confidence and reasoning chains, finding that models tend to express higher confidence when providing shorter or less elaborate reasoning. Our findings highlight how reasoning-oriented training can enhance performance in reasoning-centric tasks while potentially incurring a "reasoning tax," a cost reflected in the model's reduced ability to accurately recognize the limits of its own knowledge in small-scale models. More broadly, our work showcases how this erosion of knowledge boundaries can compromise model faithfulness, as models grow more confident without a commensurate understanding of when they should abstain.

Abstract: Cross-lingual context retrieval (extracting contextual information in one language based on requests in another) is a fundamental aspect of cross-lingual alignment, but the performance and mechanism of it for large language models (LLMs) remains unclear. In this paper, we evaluate the cross-lingual context retrieval of over 40 LLMs across 12 languages, using cross-lingual machine reading comprehension (xMRC) as a representative scenario. Our results show that post-trained open LLMs show strong cross-lingual context retrieval ability, comparable to closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4o, and their estimated oracle performances greatly improve after post-training. Our mechanism analysis shows that the cross-lingual context retrieval process can be divided into two main phases: question encoding and answer retrieval, which are formed in pre-training and post-training respectively. The phasing stability correlates with xMRC performance, and the xMRC bottleneck lies at the last model layers in the second phase, where the effect of post-training can be evidently observed. Our results also indicate that larger-scale pretraining cannot improve the xMRC performance. Instead, larger LLMs need further multilingual post-training to fully unlock their cross-lingual context retrieval potential.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the automated construction of taxonomies of factual claims from social media by generating topics at multiple levels of granularity. The resulting hierarchical structure significantly reduces redundancy and improves information accessibility. We also propose dedicated taxonomy evaluation metrics to enable comprehensive assessment. Evaluations conducted on three diverse datasets demonstrate LLMTaxo's effectiveness in producing clear, coherent, and comprehensive taxonomies. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4o mini consistently outperforms others across most metrics. The framework's flexibility and low reliance on manual intervention underscore its potential for broad applicability.

<title>HCR-Reasoner: Synergizing Large Language Models and Theory for Human-like Causal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Genuine human-like causal reasoning is fundamental for strong artificial intelligence. Humans typically identify whether an event is part of the causal chain first, and then influenced by modulatory factors such as morality, normality, and intention to make the final judgment. These two stages naturally map to the fields of 1) actual causality that provides formalisms for causal chain membership and 2) causal judgment from cognitive science that studies psychological modulators that influence causal selection. However, these two domains have largely been studied in isolation, leaving a gap for a systematic method based on LLMs. Therefore, we introduce HCR-Reasoner, a framework that systematically integrates the theory of actual causality and causal judgment into LLMs for human-like causal reasoning. It simulates humans by using actual causality formalisms to filter for structurally necessary candidate causes and causal judgment factors to determine the psychologically selected cause. For fine-grained evaluation, we introduce HCR-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 1,093 annotated instances with detailed reasoning steps. Results show HCR-Reasoner consistently and significantly improves LLMs' causal alignment with humans, and that explicitly integrating theory-guided reasoning into LLMs is highly effective for achieving faithful human-like causal reasoning.

<title>Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its internal mechanism remains poorly understood. We analyze intrinsic self-correction from a representation-level perspective. We formalize and introduce the notion of a prompt-induced shift, which is the change in hidden representations caused by a self-correction prompt. Across 5 open-source LLMs, prompt-induced shifts in text detoxification and text toxification align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These results suggest that intrinsic self-correction functions as representation steering along interpretable latent directions, beyond what standard metrics such as task scores or model confidence capture. Our analysis offers an interpretability-based account of intrinsic self-correction and contributes to a more systematic understanding of LLM prompting.

Abstract: Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.

<title>Towards Evaluating Proactive Risk Awareness of Multimodal Language Models</title>

Abstract: Human safety awareness gaps often prevent the timely recognition of everyday risks. In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI) system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench (PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128 image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI. We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests. Our dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Youliang/PaSBench.

<title>MedScore: Generalizable Factuality Evaluation of Free-Form Medical Answers by Domain-adapted Claim Decomposition and Verification</title>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing responses, they are not necessarily correct. This is especially apparent in the popular decompose-then-verify factuality evaluation pipeline, where LLMs evaluate generations by decomposing the generations into individual, valid claims. Factuality evaluation is especially important for medical answers, since incorrect medical information could seriously harm the patient. However, existing factuality systems are a poor match for the medical domain, as they are typically only evaluated on objective, entity-centric, formulaic texts such as biographies and historical topics. This differs from condition-dependent, conversational, hypothetical, sentence-structure diverse, and subjective medical answers, which makes decomposition into valid facts challenging. We propose MedScore, a new pipeline to decompose medical answers into condition-aware valid facts and verify against in-domain corpora. Our method extracts up to three times more valid facts than existing methods, reducing hallucination and vague references, and retaining condition-dependency in facts. The resulting factuality score substantially varies by decomposition method, verification corpus, and used backbone LLM, highlighting the importance of customizing each step for reliable factuality evaluation by using our generalizable and modularized pipeline for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

<title>Unifying Attention Heads and Task Vectors via Hidden State Geometry in In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: The unusual properties of in-context learning (ICL) have prompted investigations into the internal mechanisms of large language models. Prior work typically focuses on either special attention heads or task vectors at specific layers, but lacks a unified framework linking these components to the evolution of hidden states across layers that ultimately produce the model's output. In this paper, we propose such a framework for ICL in classification tasks by analyzing two geometric factors that govern performance: the separability and alignment of query hidden states. A fine-grained analysis of layer-wise dynamics reveals a striking two-stage mechanism: separability emerges in early layers, while alignment develops in later layers. Ablation studies further show that Previous Token Heads drive separability, while Induction Heads and task vectors enhance alignment. Our findings thus bridge the gap between attention heads and task vectors, offering a unified account of ICL's underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more persuasive language agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/ToMAP.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve superior performance by extending the thought length. However, a lengthy thinking trajectory leads to reduced efficiency. Most of the existing methods are stuck in the assumption of overthinking and attempt to reason efficiently by compressing the Chain-of-Thought, but this often leads to performance degradation. To address this problem, we introduce A*-Thought, an efficient tree search-based unified framework designed to identify and isolate the most essential thoughts from the extensive reasoning chains produced by these models. It formulates the reasoning process of LRMs as a search tree, where each node represents a reasoning span in the giant reasoning space. By combining the A* search algorithm with a cost function specific to the reasoning path, it can efficiently compress the chain of thought and determine a reasoning path with high information density and low cost. In addition, we also propose a bidirectional importance estimation mechanism, which further refines this search process and enhances its efficiency beyond uniform sampling. Extensive experiments on several advanced math tasks show that A*-Thought effectively balances performance and efficiency over a huge search space. Specifically, A*-Thought can improve the performance of QwQ-32B by 2.39$\times$ with low-budget and reduce the length of the output token by nearly 50% with high-budget. The proposed method is also compatible with several other LRMs, demonstrating its generalization capability. The code can be accessed at: https://github.com/AI9Stars/AStar-Thought.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLM) can be broadly categorized into real-world applications (e.g, document summarization) and synthetic tasks (e.g, needle-in-a-haystack). Despite their utility, both approaches are accompanied by certain intrinsic limitations. Real-world tasks often involve complexity that makes interpretation challenging and suffer from data contamination, whereas synthetic tasks frequently lack meaningful coherence between the target information (needle) and its surrounding context (haystack), undermining their validity as proxies for realistic applications. In response to these challenges, we posit that an ideal long-context evaluation framework should be characterized by three essential features: 1) seamless context 2) controllable setting and 3) sound evaluation. This study introduces $\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a benchmark that utilizes artificially generated biographies as a controlled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions of understanding, reasoning, and trustworthiness. Our experimental evaluation, which includes 18 LCLMs in total, demonstrates that most models still exhibit deficiencies in semantic understanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved results and are less trustworthy as context length increases. Our further analysis indicates some design choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual non-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering them vulnerable to test the model's long-context capabilities. To sum up, compared to previous synthetic benchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between mirroring authentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is highly interpretable and configurable.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, existing RAG methods either rely solely on text corpora and neglect structural knowledge, or build ad-hoc knowledge graphs (KGs) at high cost and low reliability. To address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that incorporates pre-existing large-scale KGs into RAG and applies spreading activation to enhance both retrieval and generation. KG-Infused RAG directly performs spreading activation over external KGs to retrieve relevant structured knowledge, which is then used to expand queries and integrated with corpus passages, enabling interpretable and semantically grounded multi-source retrieval. We further improve KG-Infused RAG through preference learning on sampled key stages of the pipeline. Experiments on five QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by 3.9% to 17.8%). Compared with KG-based approaches such as GraphRAG and LightRAG, our method obtains structured knowledge at lower cost while achieving superior performance. Additionally, integrating KG-Infused RAG with Self-RAG and DeepNote yields further gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has propelled AI-Generated Game Commentary (AI-GGC) into a rapidly expanding field, offering benefits such as unlimited availability and personalized narration. However, current researches in this area remain fragmented, and a comprehensive survey that systematically unifies existing efforts is still missing. To bridge this gap, our survey introduces a unified framework that systematically organizes the AI-GGC landscape. We present a novel taxonomy focused on three core commentator capabilities: Live Observation, Strategic Analysis, and Historical Recall. Commentary is further categorized into three functional types: Descriptive, Analytical, and Background. Building on this structure, we provide an in-depth review of state-of-the-art methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics across various game genres. Finally, we highlight key challenges such as real-time reasoning, multimodal integration, and evaluation bottlenecks, and outline promising directions for future research and system development in AI-GGC.

<title>AnTKV: Anchor Token-Aware Sub-Bit Vector Quantization for KV Cache in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models. Nevertheless, minimizing the accuracy degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization remains a significant challenge. While scalar quantization is constrained by 1-bit bound, vector quantization exploits intra-vector correlations and enables sub-bit regimes, making it more suitable for ultra-low-bit quantization. To further mitigate quantization-induced degradation, we reveal that the degradation is highly uneven across tokens in attention quality. To investigate this unevenness, we introduce anchor score to measure each token's sensitivity to quantization. Our analysis and experiments show that preserving a small subset (1\%) of tokens with the highest Anchor Score significantly mitigates accuracy loss under aggressive quantization.
  We propose AnTKV, a dual-stage framework that leverages anchor token-aware vector quantization to compress the KV cache. It combines offline token-aware centroids learning and online anchor token selection to balance compression and accuracy. To enable efficient deployment, we design an online anchor token selection kernel compatible with FlashAttention. It allows LLaMA3-8B to scale to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100, while delivering up to $3.5\times$ higher decoding throughput over the FP16 baseline. Experiments demonstrate that AnTKV matches or surpasses prior methods at 4-bit, and significantly reduce perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization, achieving 6.32 at 1-bit on Mistral-7B, compared to 7.25 for CQ and 15.36 for KVQuant.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control; however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference. Code is released at \href{https://github.com/MeshchaninovViacheslav/cosmos}{GitHub}

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds, there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted. With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.

<title>DP-Fusion: Token-Level Differentially Private Inference for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) do not preserve privacy at inference-time. The LLM's outputs can inadvertently reveal information about the model's context, which presents a privacy challenge when the LLM is augmented via tools or databases containing sensitive information. Existing privacy-preserving methods at inference-time have significant limitations since they (i) lack provable guarantees or (ii) have a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism for LLMs that provably bounds the influence a set of tokens in the context can have on the LLM's output. DP-Fusion works as follows: (1) label a subset of sensitive tokens, (2) infer the LLM without any sensitive tokens to obtain a baseline, (3) infer the LLM with the sensitive tokens, and (4) blend distributions so that the final output remains within a bounded distance of the baseline distribution. While this per-token influence bound also mitigates jailbreak-style prompt injection, we focus on \emph{document privatization}, where the goal is to paraphrase a document containing sensitive tokens, e.g., personally identifiable information, so that no attacker can reliably infer them from the paraphrased document while preserving high text quality. The privacy/utility trade-off is controlled by $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon=0$ hides sensitive tokens entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved text quality. We show that our method creates token-level provably privatized documents with substantially improved theoretical and empirical privacy, achieving $6\times$ lower perplexity than related DPI methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with synthetic privacy profiles. Experiments with lightweight local LLMs show that, after fine-tuning, they not only achieve markedly better privacy preservation but also match or exceed the performance of much larger zero-shot models. At the same time, the system still faces challenges in fully adhering to user instructions, underscoring the need for models with a better understanding of user-defined privacy preferences.

<title>From Sequence to Structure: Uncovering Substructure Reasoning in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis, we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs. Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

Abstract: Recently, AI agents are rapidly evolving in intelligence and widely used in professional research applications, such as STEM, software development, and finance. Among these AI agents, deep research agent is a key category as it can perform long-horizon tasks and solve problems of greater complexity. However, there are few evaluation frameworks and benchmarks that systematically and automatically investigate the capabilities of these research agents. In addition, financial research problems have distinct complexity and subtlety. To fill in the gap, we propose FinResearchBench, which is a logic tree-based Agent-as-a-Judge and targets specifically for the financial research agents. It provides a comprehensive and automatic assessment of the research agents across 7 key types of tasks in the financial research domain. The contributions of this work are two-folded: (1) the first and innovative Agent-as-a-Judge system that extracts the logic tree of the research outcome and uses it as the intermediate information to present a comprehensive, reliable, and robust evaluation; (2) finance-oriented that it covers 70 typical financial research questions, spreading across 7 frequently encountered types of task in the domain.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models by optimizing the arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. Unfortunately, GRPO is observed to suffer from unstable policy updates when facing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards, which manifest as extreme importance sampling ratios during training. In this study, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), with the aim to improve the stability of GRPO through suppressing token reward outliers. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of importance sampling ratio. GMPO is plug-and-play-simply replacing GRPO's arithmetic mean with the geometric mean of token-level rewards, as the latter is inherently less sensitive to outliers. GMPO is theoretically plausible-analysis reveals that both GMPO and GRPO are weighted forms of the policy gradient while the former enjoys more stable weights, which consequently benefits policy optimization and performance. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GMPO-7B improves the average Pass@1 of GRPO by up to 4.1%, outperforming many state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Dataset-v3, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-8B-v3 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. Furthermore, we show our moderately multilingual fine-tuning enables robust cross-lingual transfer and strong zero-shot generalization to unseen languages. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work advances multilingual LLM safety by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Abstract: Recent studies show near-perfect language-based predictions of depression scores (R2 = .70), but these "Mirror" models rely on language responses directly from depression assessments to predict depression assessment scores. These methods suffer from criterion contamination that inflate prediction estimates. We compare "Mirror" models to "Non-Mirror" models, which use other external language to predict depression scores. 110 participants completed both structured diagnostic (Mirror condition) and life history (Non-Mirror condition) interviews. LLMs were prompted to predict diagnostic depression scores. As expected, Mirror models were near-perfect. However, Non-Mirror models also displayed prediction sizes considered large in psychology. Further, both Mirror and Non-Mirror predictions correlated with other questionnaire-based depression symptoms at similar sizes, suggesting bias in Mirror models. Topic modeling revealed different theme structures across model types. As language models for depression continue to evolve, incorporating Non-Mirror approaches may support more valid and clinically useful language-based AI applications in psychological assessment.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby reducing spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning benchmarks on Gemma-2 2B and LLaMA-3.1 8B, notably achieving a +3.3% improvement in MMLU performance with 4000 samples and a +27.2% improvement in HarmBench with only 108 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities that drive performance. Our work establishes correlation-based selection as an effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language model applications.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated (and then estimated) in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's predictive distributions and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction and updating procedure. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20 questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised) generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained response generation, natural to LLMs, combining in-context learning (ICL) from demonstrations with supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL performance.

Abstract: The linguistic diversity across the African continent presents different challenges and opportunities for machine translation. This study explores the effects of data augmentation techniques in improving translation systems in low-resource African languages. We focus on two data augmentation techniques: sentence concatenation with back translation and switch-out, applying them across six African languages. Our experiments show significant improvements in machine translation performance, with a minimum increase of 25\% in BLEU score across all six languages. We provide a comprehensive analysis and highlight the potential of these techniques to improve machine translation systems for low-resource languages, contributing to the development of more robust translation systems for under-resourced languages.

Abstract: We introduce Creativity Benchmark, an evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) in marketing creativity. The benchmark covers 100 brands (12 categories) and three prompt types (Insights, Ideas, Wild Ideas). Human pairwise preferences from 678 practising creatives over 11,012 anonymised comparisons, analysed with Bradley-Terry models, show tightly clustered performance with no model dominating across brands or prompt types: the top-bottom spread is $\Delta\theta \approx 0.45$, which implies a head-to-head win probability of $0.61$; the highest-rated model beats the lowest only about $61\%$ of the time. We also analyse model diversity using cosine distances to capture intra- and inter-model variation and sensitivity to prompt reframing. Comparing three LLM-as-judge setups with human rankings reveals weak, inconsistent correlations and judge-specific biases, underscoring that automated judges cannot substitute for human evaluation. Conventional creativity tests also transfer only partially to brand-constrained tasks. Overall, the results highlight the need for expert human evaluation and diversity-aware workflows.

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.

<title>Semantic Representation Attack against Aligned Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure, here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates (89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems, generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods. First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset. Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable citations.

Abstract: A Comparison of Independent and Joint Fine-tuning Strategies for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Download PDF Neal Gregory Lawton, Alfy Samuel, Anoop Kumar, Daben Liu Published: 20 Aug 2025, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models (LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the embedding and generator models is required.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction, where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received, generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall, SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at https://d223302.github.io/SHANKS/

Abstract: Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.

<title>Autoencoding-Free Context Compression for LLMs via Contextual Semantic Anchors</title>

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View" section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views. Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 70.00 ROUGE-1 and 67.85 BLEU-1 on court view generation, as well as 86.48\% accuracy with 92.75\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for a specific downstream task. The most common fine-tuning method is to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing initialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions (SVD) of gradients or weight matrices. However, they do not provably maximize the expected gradient signal, which is critical for fast adaptation. To this end, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme that uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably maximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA performs incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the right-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by selecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given rank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of trainable parameters. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution. In summary, EVA establishes a new Pareto frontier compared to existing LoRA initialization schemes in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In times of crisis, the prompt and precise classification of disaster-related information shared on social media platforms is crucial for effective disaster response and public safety. During such critical events, individuals use social media to communicate, sharing multimodal textual and visual content. However, due to the significant influx of unfiltered and diverse data, humanitarian organizations face challenges in leveraging this information efficiently. Existing methods for classifying disaster-related content often fail to model users' credibility, emotional context, and social interaction information, which are essential for accurate classification. To address this gap, we propose CrisisSpot, a method that utilizes a Graph-based Neural Network to capture complex relationships between textual and visual modalities, as well as Social Context Features to incorporate user-centric and content-centric information. We also introduce Inverted Dual Embedded Attention (IDEA), which captures both harmonious and contrasting patterns within the data to enhance multimodal interactions and provide richer insights. Additionally, we present TSEqD (Turkey-Syria Earthquake Dataset), a large annotated dataset for a single disaster event, containing 10,352 samples. Through extensive experiments, CrisisSpot demonstrated significant improvements, achieving an average F1-score gain of 9.45% and 5.01% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available CrisisMMD dataset and the TSEqD dataset, respectively.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integral to the hospitality and tourism industry, concerns about their fairness in serving diverse identity groups persist. Grounded in social identity theory and sociotechnical systems theory, this study examines ethnic and gender biases in travel recommendations generated by LLMs. Using fairness probing, we analyze outputs from three leading open-source LLMs. The results show that test accuracy for both ethnicity and gender classifiers exceed random chance. Analysis of the most influential features reveals the presence of stereotype bias in LLM-generated recommendations. We also found hallucinations among these features, occurring more frequently in recommendations for minority groups. These findings indicate that LLMs exhibit ethnic and gender bias when functioning as travel planning assistants. This study underscores the need for bias mitigation strategies to improve the inclusivity and reliability of generative AI-driven travel planning assistance.

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale telescope arrays has boosted time-domain astronomy development but introduced operational bottlenecks, including labor-intensive observation planning, data processing, and real-time decision-making. Here we present the StarWhisper Telescope system, an AI agent framework automating end-to-end astronomical observations for surveys like the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey. By integrating large language models with specialized function calls and modular workflows, StarWhisper Telescope autonomously generates site-specific observation lists, executes real-time image analysis via pipelines, and dynamically triggers follow-up proposals upon transient detection. The system reduces human intervention through automated observation planning, telescope controlling and data processing, while enabling seamless collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. Deployed across Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey's network of 10 amateur telescopes, the StarWhisper Telescope has detected transients with promising response times relative to existing surveys. Furthermore, StarWhisper Telescope's scalable agent architecture provides a blueprint for future facilities like the Global Open Transient Telescope Array, where AI-driven autonomy will be critical for managing 60 telescopes.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://github.com/Skilteee/DiZO.

Abstract: Value model guided search is effective in steering LLM generation but suffers from a lack of robustness. This is due to verifier failure: imperfect VMs mistakenly prune valid reasoning paths, especially when encountering unseen reasoning paths generated during search. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware framework with two key components: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Value Models (UVMs), which replace single-point value estimates with value distributions to quantify prediction reliability, and (2) Group Thompson Sampling, an efficient algorithm that selects candidates based on their probability of being optimal. Experiments on two In-Distribution (ID) settings (GSM8K, MATH) and three Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) settings (e.g., AIME25, Minerva Math) show our method significantly mitigates verifier failure and boosts solution coverage, especially on OOD problems. This work provides the first systematic integration of uncertainty quantification into LLM search paradigms, enhancing robustness. The code is released at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/UVM.

Abstract: Scaling up executable code data is significant for improving language models' software engineering capability. The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer considerable potential for clinical prediction, but their complexity and heterogeneity present significant challenges for traditional machine learning methods. Recently, domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown improved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and inconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we explore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR into high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks. We convert structured EHR data into Markdown-formatted plain-text documents by replacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the use of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization capabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private medical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or even surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model, CLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. Critically, our approach requires no institution-specific training and can incorporate any medical code with a text description, whereas existing EHR foundation models operate on fixed vocabularies and can only process codes seen during pretraining. To demonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, out-of-domain for CLMBR-T-Base, whose fixed vocabulary covers only 16% of UKB codes. Notably, an LLM-based model achieves superior performance for prediction of disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality, indicating robustness to population and coding shifts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but remain prone to hallucinations. Detecting hallucinations is essential for safety-critical applications, and recent methods leverage attention map properties to this end, though their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we investigate the spectral features of attention maps by interpreting them as adjacency matrices of graph structures. We propose the $\text{LapEigvals}$ method, which utilises the top-$k$ eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from the attention maps as an input to hallucination detection probes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance among attention-based methods. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and generalisation of $\text{LapEigvals}$, paving the way for future advancements in the hallucination detection domain.

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning, tracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating personalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor intensive. We present an automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two real-world student code submission datasets in different programming languages.We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.

<title>$Q\sharp$: Provably Optimal Distributional RL for LLM Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for LLM alignment and reasoning, but existing policy-based methods, such as PPO and DPO, can fall short of fixing shortcuts inherited from pre-training. In this work, we introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically, $Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning, providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability. Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs, offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees.

<title>LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.

<title>Unseen from Seen: Rewriting Observation-Instruction Using Foundation Models for Augmenting Vision-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

<title>CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13472</link>

arXiv:2504.13472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://github.com/Eshe0922/CodeVisionary.

<title>Adaptive Data-Resilient Multi-Modal Hierarchical Multi-Label Book Genre Identification</title>

Abstract: Identifying fine-grained book genres is essential for enhancing user experience through efficient discovery, personalized recommendations, and improved reader engagement. At the same time, it provides publishers and marketers with valuable insights into consumer preferences and emerging market trends. While traditional genre classification methods predominantly rely on textual reviews or content analysis, the integration of additional modalities, such as book covers, blurbs, and metadata, offers richer contextual cues. However, the effectiveness of such multi-modal systems is often hindered by incomplete, noisy, or missing data across modalities. To address this, we propose IMAGINE (Intelligent Multi-modal Adaptive Genre Identification NEtwork), a framework designed to leverage multi-modal data while remaining robust to missing or unreliable information. IMAGINE learns modality-specific feature representations and adaptively prioritizes the most informative sources available at inference time. It further employs a hierarchical classification strategy, grounded in a curated taxonomy of book genres, to capture inter-genre relationships and support multi-label assignments reflective of real-world literary diversity. A key strength of IMAGINE is its adaptability: it maintains high predictive performance even when one modality, such as text or image, is unavailable. We also curated a large-scale hierarchical dataset that structures book genres into multiple levels of granularity, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that IMAGINE outperformed strong baselines in various settings, with significant gains in scenarios involving incomplete modality-specific data.

arXiv:2505.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48 fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration. Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate this question in context of mathematical inequalities -- specifically the prover's ability to recognize that the given problem simplifies by applying a known inequality such as AM/GM. Specifically, we are interested in their ability to do this in a compositional setting where multiple inequalities must be applied as part of a solution. We introduce Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness, but still suffers a 20% performance drop (pass@32). Even for DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B model, the gap between compositional variants and seed problems exists, implying that simply scaling up the model size alone does not fully solve the compositional weakness. Strikingly, performance remains poor for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition. All data and evaluation code can be found at https://github.com/haoyuzhao123/LeanIneqComp.

Abstract: Despite bilingual speakers frequently using mixed-language queries in web searches, Information Retrieval (IR) research on them remains scarce. To address this, we introduce MiLQ, Mixed-Language Query test set, the first public benchmark of mixed-language queries, qualified as realistic and relatively preferred. Experiments show that multilingual IR models perform moderately on MiLQ and inconsistently across native, English, and mixed-language queries, also suggesting code-switched training data's potential for robust IR models handling such queries. Meanwhile, intentional English mixing in queries proves an effective strategy for bilinguals searching English documents, which our analysis attributes to enhanced token matching compared to native queries.

<title>Hard Negatives, Hard Lessons: Revisiting Training Data Quality for Robust Information Retrieval with LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of 15 datasets from the BGE collection, reduces the training set size by 2.35$\times$, surprisingly increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We utilize LLMs as a simple, cost-effective approach to identify and relabel false negatives in training datasets. Experimental results show that relabeling false negatives as true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B retrieval models by 0.7$\unicode{x2013}$1.4 points on BEIR and by 1.7$\unicode{x2013}$1.8 points at nDCG@10 on zero-shot AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of LLMs to identify false negatives is supported by human annotation results. Our training dataset and code are publicly available.

<title>UFT: Unifying Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

arXiv:2505.16984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models, but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However, existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers. Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems, enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover potential correct pathways. The code and data is available on: https://github.com/LiaoMengqi/E3-RL4LLMs

arXiv:2505.19504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model imitation via knowledge distillation (KD). In practical scenarios, competitors can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access. We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe) strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs are accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving the performance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively generated outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating DOGe as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.

It provides over 100 data generators and verifiers spanning multiple domains including algebra, arithmetic, computation, cognition, geometry, graph theory, logic, and various common games. Its key innovation is the ability to generate virtually infinite training data with adjustable complexity, unlike most previous reasoning datasets, which are typically fixed. This procedural generation approach allows for continuous evaluation across varying difficulty levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RG in both evaluating and reinforcement learning of reasoning models.

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and reasoning tasks, showcasing remarkable capabilities. However, the enhancement of reasoning abilities and the exposure of internal reasoning processes introduce new safety vulnerabilities. A critical question arises: when reasoning becomes intertwined with harmfulness, will LRMs become more vulnerable to jailbreaks in reasoning mode? To investigate this, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and general-purpose black-box adversarial attack framework that systematically embeds harmful instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we modify key reasoning conditions in existing questions with harmful instructions, thereby constructing a reasoning pathway that guides the model step by step toward unsafe outputs. We evaluate HauntAttack on 11 LRMs and observe an average attack success rate of 70\%, achieving up to 12 percentage points of absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. Our further analysis reveals that even advanced safety-aligned models remain highly susceptible to reasoning-based attacks, offering insights into the urgent challenge of balancing reasoning capability and safety in future model development.

Abstract: Code generation is a core capability of large language models (LLMs), yet mainstream benchmarks (e.g., APPs and LiveCodeBench) contain questions with medium-level difficulty and pose no challenge to advanced LLMs. To better reflected the advanced reasoning and code generation ability, We introduce Humanity's Last Code Exam (HLCE), comprising 235 most challenging problems from the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC World Finals) and the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) spanning 2010 - 2024. As part of HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming. Our code and dataset are also public available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently hallucinate by over-committing to spurious visual cues. Prior remedies-Visual and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (VCD, ICD)-mitigate this issue, yet the mechanism remains opaque. We first empirically show that their improvements systematically coincide with redistributions of cross-modal attention. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Steerable Contrastive Decoding (ASCD), which directly steers the attention scores during decoding. ASCD combines (i) positive steering, which amplifies automatically mined text-centric heads-stable within a model and robust across domains-with (ii) negative steering, which dampens on-the-fly identified critical visual tokens. The method incurs negligible runtime and memory overhead and requires no additional training. Across five MLLM backbones and three decoding schemes, ASCD reduces hallucination on POPE, CHAIR, and MMHal-Bench by up to 38.2 percent while improving accuracy on standard VQA benchmarks, including MMMU, MM-VET, ScienceQA, TextVQA, and GQA. These results position attention steering as a simple, model-agnostic, and principled route to safer, more faithful multimodal generation.

We observe that motion quantization introduces approximation errors that cap motion quality, and that unifying discrete text and continuous motion within a single-stream backbone amplifies cross-modal interference. Motivated by recent multi-branch Transformer designs that separate signals from different modalities, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal motion-language model for both understanding and generation. MotionGPT3 encodes raw motion into a continuous latent space using a variational autoencoder (VAE), thereby avoiding quantization-induced artifacts, while leveraging the semantic prior of pretrained language models. A dual-stream Transformer with shared attention preserves modality-specific routes while enabling controlled, bidirectional information flow, which reduces interference, stabilizing optimization, and empirically accelerates convergence without degrading fidelity. For multimodal joint training, a generate-then-align three-stage schedule further improves stability and limits cross-task interference. Experiments show that MotionGPT3 achieves 2x faster convergence in training loss and up to 4x faster convergence in validation, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on standard motion understanding and motion generation benchmarks.

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

<title>Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs</title>

Abstract: The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.
  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision.
  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

Abstract: The increasing demand for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs) is bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism. The community has proposed sparse attention to mitigate this issue. However, position-aware sparse attention methods rely on static sparse structures that lack adaptability to diverse query contexts, while content-aware sparse attention methods depend on heuristic key-value selection, hindering full differentiability. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, a method that merges the advantages of both position-aware and content-aware approaches. Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA) achieves this through three key innovations: First, it leverages value vector representations to generate content-aware dynamic masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and attend to critical information. Second, it computes position-aware sparse weights in a hardware-friendly manner, efficiently skipping unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we demonstrate that the introduced dynamic mask and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, supporting end-to-end training. We have validated the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. A large body of experimental evidence shows that DMA consistently holds a Pareto advantage over state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines in tasks including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, standard benchmarks, and needle in a haystack tests, while also delivering up to a 10x overall speedup. These results highlight its ability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling capabilities. Our computational kernel code is now open-source at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to encourage further research and application by the community.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.

Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1) developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer, enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs constrained to text-only input. All the resources are available at https://walkermitty.github.io/VimoRAG/

Abstract: Sycophancy (overly agreeable or flattering behavior) is critical to understand in the context of human-AI collaboration, especially in decision-making settings like health, law, and education. Existing methods for studying sycophancy in LLMs are either descriptive (study behavior change when sycophancy is elicited) or normative (provide values-based judgment on behavior change). Together, these approaches help us understand the extent, and impacts, of sycophancy. However, existing normative approaches only apply for objective tasks where ground-truth data exists, ignoring the natural subjectivity in many NLP tasks.
  Drawing from behavioral economics and rational decision theory, we introduce an Bayesian framework to study the normative effects of sycophancy on rationality in LLMs, without requiring labeled ground-truth. Using this interdisciplinary framework, we study sycophantic behavior in multiple LLM baselines across three different tasks, experimenting with various methods for eliciting sycophancy and obtaining probability judgments from LLMs. We find significant evidence of sycophancy in our experiments (7 of 8 baselines for one of our probing techniques), and observe that sycophancy is more likely to reduce rationality than it is to increase rationality in LLMs' decisions when they are directly probed for probabilities (2 out of 4 baselines show significant increases overall).

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism. Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

<title>A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs</title>

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&amp;CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&amp;CK more efficient. A replication package is available for download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17341503.

arXiv:2509.05276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4 percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby quadratically reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM keeps the pretrained LLM backbone frozen, yielding faster training and lower memory usage. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: \textit{Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling?} To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychCounsel-Bench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70\% accuracy to pass. PsychCounsel-Bench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs. We release the proposed dataset for public use: https://github.com/cloversjtu/PsychCounsel-Bench

Summary: 
The study explores the relationship between discourse connectives and language models (LMs) in understanding novel entities in different contexts. A dataset called WUGNECTIVES comprising 8,880 stimuli was created to evaluate LMs' inferences regarding connectives linking entities to attributes. Results showed that tuning LMs to exhibit reasoning behavior led to significant improvements for most connectives. However, LMs struggled with connectives expressing concessive meanings. The study highlights the importance of language cues in informing LMs about the world and opens up possibilities for further investigations into their functional role. The WUGNECTIVES dataset is made publicly available for future research. <div>

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments, with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time, there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type, with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

This study addresses the limitations of current toxicity detectors in effectively capturing the multi-dimensional nature of toxic prompts generated by large language models (LLMs). Three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection were introduced, annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. The study provides a theoretical proof that training with pseudo-labels yields better performance than learning from single-label supervision, and develops a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms advanced baselines like GPT-4o and DeepSeek, enabling more accurate and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content. This research contributes to improving the reliability of toxicity detection systems and addresses safety concerns associated with LLM-generated harmful content.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts. This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL}, \textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision. In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method. Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks alone in the future.

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly, inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates (1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in U.S. Presidential debates.

<div> Memory Layer, Sparse Parameter Updates, Catastrophic Forgetting, Language Models, Continual Learning  
Summary:  
Memory layer models, with sparsely updated parameters, show promise in addressing catastrophic forgetting in language models. Sparse memory finetuning, by updating only highly activated memory slots, reduces interference between new knowledge and existing capabilities, leading to less forgetting. Compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning, sparse memory finetuning exhibits significantly less forgetting while still acquiring new knowledge effectively. This approach proves beneficial for continual learning in large language models.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual learning in large language models.

<div> Slavic languages, MLAMA dataset, knowledge retrieval scores, grammaticality, neural machine translation<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This study focuses on improving multilingual factual knowledge assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing issues with grammaticality in benchmark datasets. The researchers sampled 4 Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compared knowledge retrieval scores between the original dataset and sentence-level translations using Google Translate and ChatGPT. They found a significant increase in knowledge retrieval scores with improved grammaticality in translations. Similar patterns were observed in 5 additional languages from different language families. The findings suggest that controlling grammaticality in multilingual datasets leads to higher and more interpretable results, which can be achieved through whole sentence translation with neural machine translation or LLM systems. The dataset and code are available on Github, emphasizing the importance of considering grammatical and semantic information in multilingual knowledge assessment tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4 Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and all related code is published at the Github repository: https://github.com/ZurichNLP/Fluent-mLAMA.

<div> Keywords: social media platforms, political discourse, topic taxonomy, Meta political ads, moral framing dimensions

Summary: 
The study introduces a framework for generating a topic taxonomy from unlabeled data on social media platforms, specifically focusing on Meta political ads related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. By leveraging large language models, the framework uncovers discourse structures, synthesizes topic labels, and annotates topics with moral framing dimensions. The analysis reveals that voting and immigration ads dominate spending and impressions, while abortion and election-integrity ads have significant reach. Funding patterns show polarization, with different moral foundations and framing used in messaging. Demographic targeting is also evident, highlighting correlations between moral foundations and issues. This scalable and interpretable framework enables better understanding of emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and moral aspects of digital political communication.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse, but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs, abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral underpinnings of digital political communication.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework called \textsc{Structure-R1} that transforms retrieved content into structured representations optimized for reasoning. By leveraging reinforcement learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} dynamically generates structural formats based on the demands of multi-step reasoning, enhancing information density and contextual clarity. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed schemas, \textsc{Structure-R1} adopts a generative paradigm to produce task-specific structures tailored to individual queries. The framework includes a self-reward structural verification mechanism to ensure the quality and reliability of the generated structures. Experimental results on knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{Structure-R1} achieves competitive performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much larger models. Theoretical analysis further supports the effectiveness of structured representations in improving reasoning capabilities. The code and data for \textsc{Structure-R1} are available at https://github.com/jlwu002/sr1.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density and contextual clarity.

<div> Keywords: Large Audio-Language Models, context-extension methods, Partial YaRN, Virtual Longform Audio Training, long-context audio understanding

Summary:
Partial YaRN is introduced as a training-free method for extending context in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) through audio token modifications while preserving text capabilities. Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT) is proposed as a training strategy that simulates diverse audio lengths during training to enhance generalization and improve robustness for long-context audio understanding. Experimental results on SALMONN and Qwen2-Audio demonstrate that Partial YaRN outperforms original models in various settings, and VLAT training leads to substantial performance improvements, particularly on longer audio inputs of unseen lengths. These advancements in context extension and training strategies offer promising opportunities for enhancing the capabilities of LALMs in understanding long-form audio content. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Introduction of Partial YaRN, a training-free audio-only context extension method for LALMs.
- Proposal of Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT) as a training strategy to improve generalization and robustness for long-context audio understanding.
- Superior performance of Partial YaRN over original models in diverse settings.
- Significant improvement achieved through VLAT training strategy, particularly on long audio inputs of unseen lengths.
- Promising advancements for enhancing long-form audio understanding in Large Audio-Language Models. <div>
arXiv:2510.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement, achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

- Collaboration in text space and latent-space communication strategies were examined.
- Shifting DDLM --> ARM communication to latent space led to significant accuracy gains.
- Combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor provided computational savings with little impact on accuracy.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding. TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS, Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations, bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate, scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph (KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error (RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2) context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to 3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the contribution of each optimization.

Summary: 
The study examines the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating and evaluating classical Chinese poetry. A three-step evaluation framework is proposed, combining computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert validation. Six state-of-the-art LLMs are evaluated in terms of themes, emotions, imagery, form, and style. The analysis uncovers biases in LLM-generated content and evaluation processes, with LLMs displaying "echo chamber" effects and deviating from human judgments. The findings underscore both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in creative tasks, emphasizing the need for hybrid validation involving both human experts and models. The study highlights the importance of considering cultural and technical complexities in evaluating creative outputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains, yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery, form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality, often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices, thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Knowledge Graphs, Question Answering, AutoGraph-R1, Task Performance<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces AutoGraph-R1, a framework that optimizes the construction of knowledge graphs for question answering systems using Reinforcement Learning. Traditional methods decouple the graph construction process from its downstream application, leading to suboptimal graph structures. AutoGraph-R1 directly optimizes graph construction for task performance by training an LLM constructor through policy learning. Two task-aware reward functions are designed to evaluate the functional utility of the graphs in a RAG pipeline. Results show that AutoGraph-R1 consistently improves performance on multiple question answering benchmarks compared to using task-agnostic baseline graphs. The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of building knowledge graphs that are specifically useful for the intended application, closing the gap between construction and application in QA systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG) construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel, task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

Summary: 
This study delves into the realm of automatic readability assessment, shedding light on the factors that influence human perceptions of readability. By analyzing 897 judgments, the researchers discovered that beyond surface-level indicators, the information content and topic of a text greatly impact its comprehensibility. The evaluation of 15 popular readability metrics across five English datasets revealed a discrepancy between traditional metrics and human assessments. Model-based metrics emerged as more aligned with human judgments, with four out of six model-based metrics consistently outperforming traditional ones. This highlights the potential of model-based approaches in improving readability assessment methods and bridging the gap between existing metrics and human perceptions. Model-based metrics offer a promising direction for enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of readability assessment in written communication.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments, finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced, model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more promising direction.

Summary:  
Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promise for improving performance by aggregating models' next-token probability distributions. However, applying this approach to long-form generation requires careful consideration of tokenization mismatch and consensus in probability distributions. The SAFE framework selectively ensembles by taking these factors into account, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency on benchmarks like MATH500 and BBH. A probability sharpening strategy further enhances stability by consolidating probabilities for sub-word tokens. Even when ensembling fewer than 1% of tokens, SAFE achieves significant gains, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers, its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability, we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500 and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of tokens.

Summary:  
LayoutRL is introduced as a reinforcement learning framework to enhance layout understanding in document parsing by integrating composite rewards. The Infinity-Doc-400K dataset is constructed to train Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model showing robust generalization across various document types. Evaluation on benchmarks demonstrates that Infinity-Parser consistently outperforms specialized document parsing systems and general vision-language models. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across different domains, languages, and structural complexities. Code, dataset, and model will be made available to enable reproducible research in document parsing.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

This article examines the robustness of Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) to speech disfluency, particularly in individuals with conditions like Parkinson's disease. The authors introduce VocalBench-DF, a framework for evaluating disfluency across various dimensions, and assess 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs. Results indicate significant performance degradation in real-world applications, with challenges in phoneme-level processing and long-context modeling identified as key obstacles. The study underscores the need for enhancing disfluency handling in Speech-LLMs to achieve inclusivity and improve overall performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs, overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures. Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly inclusive Speech-LLMs

Summary: 
The article focuses on addressing the challenges faced in advertising and recommending games on online platforms due to game sparsity and imbalance issues. To combat sparsity, the User Game Lifecycle (UGL) is introduced to enrich user behaviors in games. Two innovative strategies are also proposed to manipulate user behaviors effectively. In order to tackle game imbalance, an Inverse Probability Masking strategy is presented for UGL representation learning. Experimental results show that UGL representations improve the model significantly, leading to better performance in game advertising and in-game item recommendation. Offline and online experiments demonstrate that the UGL representations achieve an increase in AUC and CVR for game advertising, as well as improvements in AUC and ARPU for in-game item recommendation. <div>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms. Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games. Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a 0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

Summary: 
This study introduces a framework to enhance the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems for generating fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. By specializing the MedGemma model and employing a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across various medical domains, the model was fine-tuned using the QLoRA method. The improved model showed enhanced classification accuracy and significantly improved caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness as evaluated by the RAGAS framework. This validation confirms the model's ability to generate reliable and factually grounded descriptions, ensuring high-quality queries for multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support. This work establishes a robust pipeline for enhancing medical Vision-Language Models and showcases the potential for specialized models to improve clinical decision-making processes.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.

Summary: 
The article discusses the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in actively acquiring missing evidence under incomplete information, using a benchmark called GuessBench. This benchmark evaluates MLLMs in selecting target images without task-specific priors to support active reasoning. Results show that MLLMs perform better in passive settings compared to active reasoning, highlighting the need for improvement in the latter. Challenges identified include fine-grained perception and timely decision-making. Ablation studies reveal that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller models, while thinking-oriented methods offer consistent gains across model sizes. These findings suggest potential research directions for enhancing multimodal active reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on multimodal active reasoning.

Summary: 
The study introduces a method for generating controllable abstract summaries using large language models through prompt engineering. A multi-stage prompt generation framework is designed to enhance summary quality and controllability by incorporating semantic analysis, topic modeling, and noise control. The experiment conducted on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset highlights the impact of prompt length, data noise, and text types on summary generation. Results indicate that the quality of generated summaries is influenced by prompt length, with very short or long prompts leading to decreased quality. Additionally, increasing data noise negatively affects summary accuracy. Moreover, the model performs better on news texts compared to academic articles. This research underscores the importance of prompt strategies and text preprocessing in optimizing summary accuracy and controllability.

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality. Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries. The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance summary accuracy and controllability.

Summary:<br />
Mobile agents use Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with smartphone user interfaces (UIs). Cloud-based LLMs offer high task accuracy but require uploading the full UI state, risking unnecessary information exposure. Local LLMs avoid uploads but have limited capacity, leading to lower task success rates. The proposed CORE framework combines cloud and local LLMs to reduce UI exposure while maintaining task accuracy. CORE includes layout-aware block partitioning, co-planning, and co-decision-making components. It also incorporates a multi-round accumulation mechanism to address local misjudgments. Experiments across various mobile apps demonstrate that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while achieving task success rates close to cloud-only agents. This approach effectively mitigates privacy concerns related to unnecessary data exposure to the cloud.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI $\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$, which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3) $\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks, and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block. CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local misjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and tasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task success rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating unnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in various cognitive tasks, but they also exhibit deceptive behaviors that pose risks in real-world applications. To address this, the DeceptionBench benchmark evaluates deception across societal domains and explores underlying behavioral patterns. The benchmark includes 150 scenarios in Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, analyzing over 1,000 samples for deception tendencies. It examines intrinsic tendencies like self-interest and sycophancy, as well as how contextual factors influence deceptive outputs under neutral, reward-based, and coercive conditions. Through experiments with LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), vulnerabilities are identified, showing increased deception under reinforcement dynamics. These findings highlight the need for improved safeguards against manipulative cues and deceptive behaviors in language models. The code and resources for DeceptionBench are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains, what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150 meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples, providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics. Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in fields such as law, healthcare, and finance, necessitating robust temporal reasoning abilities to ensure consistency across different time frames. A new benchmark called temporal referential consistency and the TEMP-ReCon resource have been introduced to evaluate LLMs across various linguistic contexts. The study findings reveal that LLMs exhibit insufficient temporal referent consistency, prompting the development of a new model, UnTRaP, based on reasoning path alignment to enhance temporal consistency. Empirical experiments show that UnTRaP outperforms several baseline models in improving the temporal referential consistency of LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains, including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency, accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared to several baseline models.

In this paper, a dynamic character grouping method is proposed to address the inefficiencies of subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and character-level models in representing rare words and managing large embedding matrices in large language models. The approach leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization by appending end-of-patch markers and introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity. This method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations without the need for additional models. Empirical results show that this approach matches or exceeds the performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while maintaining a compact vocabulary. The proposed method combines the benefits of both subword tokenization and character-level models, providing a balanced solution for efficient language model representation.

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity, our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while maintaining a compact vocabulary.

<div> Latent reasoning, LLM, attention masks, Latent-SFT, compression rate <br />
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities with chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning incurs high computational costs. A new approach, Latent-SFT, restricts the latent space to the column space of the LLM vocabulary to improve performance. This two-stage learning framework guides the generation of latent tokens using specialized attention masks in the first stage, and then trains the LLM to generate these tokens autonomously for latent reasoning in the second stage. Latent-SFT achieves a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while reducing reasoning chains by up to 4 times. Additionally, lexical probability-based latent reasoning outperforms hidden-state-based approaches on Math500 and AIME24 datasets. Metrics show that latent reasoning offers effective compression rates and global parallelism by combining a single path compression and the superposition of multiple paths. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea, we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of multiple paths.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

Summary:
TokenTiming is a new algorithm proposed for accelerated inference of large language models (LLMs). It addresses the limitation of speculative decoding by allowing draft and target models to have different vocabularies. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), TokenTiming re-encodes the draft token sequence to create a new target token sequence and uses DTW to transfer probability distributions for speculative sampling. This approach does not require retraining or modification of existing models, making it a versatile tool for LLM acceleration. Comprehensive experiments show a 1.57x speedup with TokenTiming. This work enables a universal approach for selecting draft models, enhancing the efficiency and practicality of speculative decoding for various tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, cross-lingual gap, bias-variance decomposition, response variance, target accuracy

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as a link between knowledge in different languages on the web. Research has identified a cross-lingual gap, where accuracy drops when querying knowledge in a target language. While previous studies attributed this to differences in latent representations, this work suggests that variance in responses in the target language is the main issue. The cross-lingual gap is formalized using bias-variance decomposition, and experiments support this hypothesis. Interventions at inference time that control variance have been shown to reduce the cross-lingual gap. By providing a simple prompt instruction to reduce response variance, target accuracy improved by 20-25% across various models. This research sheds light on the importance of response variance in addressing cross-lingual challenges in Large Language Models. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

ParallaxRAG introduces a framework that decouples queries and graph triples into multi-view spaces, improving retrieval architecture by enforcing head diversity and constraining weakly related paths. The method leverages the specialization of different attention heads in semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages to guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning. Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ demonstrate competitive retrieval and question-answering performance, reduced hallucination, and good generalization within a unified setup.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning. Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 + Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is accepted.

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE) benchmark to assess instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Korean.
- Current evaluations mainly focus on English models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages like Korean.
- KITE is designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific instructions, targeting diverse, open-ended tasks.
- The evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics and human assessments to reveal performance differences across models.
- By releasing the KITE dataset and code, the authors aim to encourage inclusive LLM development for underrepresented languages and inspire similar research efforts. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages. Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features, honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love. Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

Summary: 
Document alignment is crucial for hierarchical mining across languages in a web domain. Existing methods like TK-PERT and Optimal Transport (OT) provide high precision but lack efficiency for large-scale web mining data. This paper introduces a new method, BiMax, a cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score, that improves efficiency compared to OT while maintaining accuracy. BiMax achieves comparable accuracy to OT but with a 100-fold increase in speed on the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task. Additionally, the study evaluates various multilingual sentence embedding models to enhance performance. The alignment methods discussed in this paper are available as a tool called EmbDA, open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA (https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA).

The article introduces HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite for evaluating the ability of language models to propose sets of explanations in scientific workflows. It focuses on three indicators: Validity (precision of proposals), Uniqueness (non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of admissible set). The study tests HypoSpace in three structured domains with deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces. It reveals that while Validity remains high across models, Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space increases, indicating mode collapse.

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined: multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators: Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness (non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore and cover admissible explanation spaces.

Four methods of incorporating context into classifier input are compared: text concatenation, embedding concatenation, hierarchical transformer-based fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments on the Latent Hatred dataset and MAMI dataset of misogynous memes show that contextual information and incorporation method are crucial. The results indicate significant improvements, with gains of up to 3 F1 points in textual setups and 6 F1 points in multimodal setups compared to a zero-context baseline.

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system, based on embedding concatenation.

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However, these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20% across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms of exact match.

Summary:<br /><br />Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are gaining popularity as an alternative to Autoregressive Models (ARMs). This study examines DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon. DLMs exhibit dynamic attention sinks that shift during token generation, unlike ARMs. Although importance of attention sinks is high in ARMs, DLMs are resilient to their removal, showing only minor performance degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models, revealing differences in attention allocation and usage compared to autoregressive models. <div>

DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

<div> game theory, evaluation, language models, peer review, human judgment

Summary:<br />
This work explores the use of game theory principles for evaluating large language models (LLMs), addressing limitations in conventional evaluation methods. The proposed method involves LLMs assessing each other's output through self-play and peer review, which is then compared to human judgment. Game-theoretic voting algorithms are used to aggregate peer assessments and evaluate alignment with human preferences. Results demonstrate both convergences and divergences between theoretical predictions and human evaluations, providing insights into the capabilities of LLMs. This novel approach integrates mutual evaluation, game-theoretic aggregation, and human validation, offering a comprehensive understanding of LLM performance. <div>

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced, subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation, game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs.

<div> Keywords: AI translator, validation, machine translation quality evaluation, hallucinations, segment-by-segment translation

Summary: 
The article discusses the validation of AI Whale-to-English translators without the need for direct interaction with animals. It proposes an evaluation methodology based on segment-by-segment translation and the NLP shuffle test to identify "hallucinations" or false translations. Proof-of-concept experiments on human languages and constructed languages confirm the effectiveness of this reference-free metric, even under data scarcity. The research suggests that interaction may not be necessary in the early stages of learning to translate effectively. Overall, the study highlights the potential advantages of evaluating translator outputs solely based on their English outputs, offering insights into improving translation quality and efficiency. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,'' false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations, which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early stages of learning to translate.

<div> Keywords: language models, transformer toy model, truth subspaces, factual statements, linear representation<br />
Summary:<br />
Recent studies have found that large language models have linear subspaces that can separate true statements from false ones, but the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not well understood. A new one-layer transformer toy model has been introduced that can replicate these truth subspaces and demonstrate how they can emerge. The model is trained on a data distribution where factual statements are paired with other factual statements, prompting the model to learn how to distinguish between true and false statements in order to minimize its loss. Experimental results on pretrained language models support this finding. The learning process in the toy model involves two phases: first memorizing individual factual associations and then, over time, learning to linearly separate true from false statements, ultimately improving language-modeling accuracy. This study offers both a mechanistic explanation and empirical evidence for the emergence of linear truth representations in language models.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models. Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear truth representations can emerge in language models.

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction. However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM) generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity, Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity, aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage generation.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer framework for sentiment analysis in product reviews and social media posts. The framework combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores. It starts with VADER-based initial sentiment estimations and refines them through a two-stage adjustment process using DistilBERT and fuzzy logic principles. A custom fuzzy inference system maps the refined scores onto a continuum, leading to expert-like judgments. The framework is evaluated on four domain-specific datasets, showing improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment extremes, and reduced misclassifications. The integration of symbolic reasoning with neural models enhances the interpretability and accuracy of sentiment analysis in linguistically dynamic domains.

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics (distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically dynamic domains.

Summary: 
Slot filling is a crucial task in spoken language understanding, typically approached through a cascade of speech recognition and natural language understanding components. The emergence of speech-based large language models has revolutionized this task, offering a unified and generative approach with zero-shot capabilities. This study aims to improve slot filling performance by identifying gaps and proposing enhancements in training data, architecture, and strategies. Through empirical analysis, the study establishes an upper bound for slot filling performance and showcases significant improvements through various measures. By addressing performance, robustness, and generalization challenges, the study provides practical recommendations for leveraging speech-based large language models effectively, shedding light on the potential and pitfalls of these advanced technologies. <div>

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU), traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities, generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance, robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed). Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum, leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web continuously.

Abstract: We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include QK-Normalization for attention stability, hybrid normalization techniques, and enhanced positional encoding. A three-stage training strategy further optimizes learning efficiency. Evaluations show that Shakti-Shakti-VLM-1B and Shakti-VLM-4B excel in document understanding, Visual Reasoning, OCR extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably, although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss, cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of \emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents, and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains such as webpages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions, vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization. Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance. Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology, termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over 1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality, whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results under MIT license: https://github.com/sam-paech/auto-antislop.

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over 70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable, reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.

Abstract: A core challenge for autonomous LLM agents in collaborative settings is balancing robust privacy understanding and preservation alongside task efficacy. Existing privacy benchmarks only focus on simplistic, single-turn interactions where private information can be trivially omitted without affecting task outcomes. In this paper, we introduce MAGPIE (Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation), a novel benchmark of 200 high-stakes tasks designed to evaluate privacy understanding and preservation in multi-agent collaborative, non-adversarial scenarios. MAGPIE integrates private information as essential for task resolution, forcing agents to balance effective collaboration with strategic information control. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art agents, including GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5-Pro, exhibit significant privacy leakage, with Gemini 2.5-Pro leaking up to 50.7% and GPT-5 up to 35.1% of the sensitive information even when explicitly instructed not to. Moreover, these agents struggle to achieve consensus or task completion and often resort to undesirable behaviors such as manipulation and power-seeking (e.g., Gemini 2.5-Pro demonstrating manipulation in 38.2% of the cases). These findings underscore that current LLM agents lack robust privacy understanding and are not yet adequately aligned to simultaneously preserve privacy and maintain effective collaboration in complex environments.

<title>Soundness-Aware Level: A Microscopic Signature that Predicts LLM Reasoning Potential</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses ("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek) and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation. We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short, showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

<title>Multi-dimensional Data Analysis and Applications Basing on LLM Agents and Knowledge Graph Interactions</title>

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive, heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination" issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

<title>DRO-InstructZero: Distributionally Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However, popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently, prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this, DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points. Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift. Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment under real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications are blindfolded to the infrastructure underneath and generate tokens autoregressively, indifferent to the system load, thus risking inferencing latency inflation and poor user experience. Our first-cut controller, named beLLMan, enables the LLM infrastructure to actively and progressively signal the first-party LLM application to adjust the output length in response to changing system load. On a real testbed with H100 GPUs, beLLMan helps keep inferencing latency under control (upto 8X lower end-to-end latency) and reduces energy consumption by 25% (while serving 19% more requests) during periods of congestion for a summarization workload.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise, logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs) often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context management that hinders long-horizon research. We present \texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring \textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a \coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization -- users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including \textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication} to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research -- from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

Abstract: We present SQuAI (https://squai.scads.ai/), a scalable and trustworthy multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for scientific question answering (QA) with large language models (LLMs). SQuAI addresses key limitations of existing RAG systems in the scholarly domain, where complex, open-domain questions demand accurate answers, explicit claims with citations, and retrieval across millions of scientific documents. Built on over 2.3 million full-text papers from arXiv.org, SQuAI employs four collaborative agents to decompose complex questions into sub-questions, retrieve targeted evidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to improve contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI integrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting sentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer relevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG baseline. We further release a benchmark of 1,000 scientific question-answer-evidence triplets to support reproducibility. With transparent reasoning, verifiable citations, and domain-wide scalability, SQuAI demonstrates how multi-agent RAG enables more trustworthy scientific QA with LLMs.

Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks, including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management. Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM. Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next, building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning and text generation capabilities, prompting their use in scientific literature analysis, including novelty assessment. While evaluating novelty of scientific papers is crucial for peer review, it requires extensive knowledge of related work, something not all reviewers have. While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature analysis supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited transparency and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information retrieval module. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{GraphMind}$, an easy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the novelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore related ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing verifiable contextual insights. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate key elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships, and assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs such as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction, retrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a rich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its connections to existing work. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ is available at https://oyarsa.github.io/graphmind and a demonstration video at https://youtu.be/wKbjQpSvwJg.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in solving various tasks, progressively evolving into general-purpose assistants. The increasing integration of LLMs into society has sparked interest in whether they exhibit psychological patterns, and whether these patterns remain consistent across different contexts -- questions that could deepen the understanding of their behaviors. Inspired by psychometrics, this paper presents a {comprehensive benchmark for quantifying psychological constructs of LLMs}, encompassing psychological dimension identification, assessment dataset design, and assessment with results validation. Our work identifies five key psychological constructs -- personality, values, emotional intelligence, theory of mind, and self-efficacy -- assessed through a suite of 13 datasets featuring diverse scenarios and item types. We uncover significant discrepancies between LLMs' self-reported traits and their response patterns in real-world scenarios, revealing complexities in their behaviors. Our findings also show that some preference-based tests, originally designed for humans, could not solicit reliable responses from LLMs. This paper offers a thorough psychometric assessment of LLMs, providing insights into reliable evaluation and potential applications in AI and social sciences.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism within large language models (LLMs), previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to reduce the redundancy by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights.
  Driven by these insights, we introduce LISA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LISA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LISA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53%-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LISA achieve a 6x compression of Q and K matrices within the attention mechanism, with maximum throughput improvements 19.5%, 32.3%, and 40.1% for LLaMA3-8B, LLaMA2-7B, and LLaMA2-13B, respectively.

Abstract: Unstructured text data annotation is foundational to management research and Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a cost-effective and scalable alternative to human annotation. The validity of insights drawn from LLM annotated data critically depends on minimizing the discrepancy between LLM assigned labels and the unobserved ground truth, as well as ensuring long-term reproducibility of results. We address the gap in the literature on LLM annotation by decomposing measurement error in LLM-based text annotation into four distinct sources: (1) guideline-induced error from inconsistent annotation criteria, (2) baseline-induced error from unreliable human reference standards, (3) prompt-induced error from suboptimal meta-instruction formatting, and (4) model-induced error from architectural differences across LLMs. We develop the SILICON methodology to systematically reduce measurement error from LLM annotation in all four sources above. Empirical validation across seven management research cases shows iteratively refined guidelines substantially increases the LLM-human agreement compared to one-shot guidelines; expert-generated baselines exhibit higher inter-annotator agreement as well as are less prone to producing misleading LLM-human agreement estimates compared to crowdsourced baselines; placing content in the system prompt reduces prompt-induced error; and model performance varies substantially across tasks. To further reduce error, we introduce a cost-effective multi-LLM labeling method, where only low-confidence items receive additional labels from alternative models. Finally, in addressing closed source model retirement cycles, we introduce an intuitive regression-based methodology to establish robust reproducibility protocols. Our evidence indicates that reducing each error source is necessary, and that SILICON supports reproducible, rigorous annotation in management research.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often causes overfitting to specific prompt wording, where minor phrasing variations drastically reduce performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning (PAFT), a method that enhances robustness through dynamic prompt variation during training. PAFT first generates diverse synthetic prompts, then continuously samples from this set to construct training instances, forcing models to learn fundamental task principles rather than surface-level patterns. Across systematic evaluations using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT), PAFT demonstrates substantially improved prompt robustness, achieving 7% higher generalization accuracy on unseen prompts than standard methods. In addition to enhanced robustness, PAFT consistently yields superior overall performance on established benchmarks for question answering, mathematical reasoning, and tool use. Notably, models trained with PAFT attain 3.2 faster inference speeds due to reduced prompt sensitivity. Ablation studies further validate effectiveness of PAFT, while theoretical analysis reveals that PAFT can effectively enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of LLM.

<title>Event Segmentation Applications in Large Language Model Enabled Automated Recall Assessments</title>

Abstract: Understanding how individuals perceive and recall information in their natural environments is critical to understanding potential failures in perception (e.g., sensory loss) and memory (e.g., dementia). Event segmentation, the process of identifying distinct events within dynamic environments, is central to how we perceive, encode, and recall experiences. This cognitive process not only influences moment-to-moment comprehension but also shapes event specific memory. Despite the importance of event segmentation and event memory, current research methodologies rely heavily on human judgements for assessing segmentation patterns and recall ability, which are subjective and time-consuming. A few approaches have been introduced to automate event segmentation and recall scoring, but validity with human responses and ease of implementation require further advancements. To address these concerns, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate event segmentation and assess recall, employing chat completion and text-embedding models, respectively. We validated these models against human annotations and determined that LLMs can accurately identify event boundaries, and that human event segmentation is more consistent with LLMs than among humans themselves. Using this framework, we advanced an automated approach for recall assessments which revealed semantic similarity between segmented narrative events and participant recall can estimate recall performance. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively simulate human segmentation patterns and provide recall evaluations that are a scalable alternative to manual scoring. This research opens novel avenues for studying the intersection between perception, memory, and cognitive impairment using methodologies driven by artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Structural priming is a cognitive phenomenon where exposure to a particular syntactic structure increases the likelihood of producing the same structure in subsequent utterances. While humans consistently demonstrate structural priming effects across various linguistic contexts, it remains unclear whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit similar syntactic preservation behaviors. We introduce PRISMATIC, the first multimodal structural priming dataset, which advances computational linguistics by providing a standardized benchmark for investigating syntax-vision interactions. We propose the Syntactic Preservation Index (SPI), a novel reference-free evaluation metric designed specifically to assess structural priming effects in sentence level. Using this metric, we constructed and tested models with two different multimodal encoding architectures to investigate their structural preservation capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that models with both encoding methods show comparable syntactic priming effects. However, only fusion-encoded models exhibit robust positive correlations between priming effects and visual similarity, suggesting a cognitive process more aligned with human psycholinguistic patterns. This work provides new insights into evaluating and understanding how syntactic information is processed in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Clinical cohort definition is crucial for patient recruitment and observational studies, yet translating inclusion/exclusion criteria into SQL queries remains challenging and manual. We present an automated system utilizing large language models that combines criteria parsing, two-level retrieval augmented generation with specialized knowledge bases, medical concept standardization, and SQL generation to retrieve patient cohorts with patient funnels. The system achieves 0.75 F1-score in cohort identification on EHR data, effectively capturing complex temporal and logical relationships. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated cohort generation for epidemiological research.

<title>EMCee: Improving Multilingual Capability of LLMs via Bridging Knowledge and Reasoning with Extracted Synthetic Multilingual Context</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress across a wide range of tasks, yet their heavy reliance on English-centric training data leads to significant performance degradation in non-English languages. While existing multilingual prompting methods emphasize reformulating queries into English or enhancing reasoning capabilities, they often fail to incorporate the language- and culture-specific grounding that is essential for some queries. To address this limitation, we propose EMCee (Extracting synthetic Multilingual Context and merging), a simple yet effective framework that enhances the multilingual capabilities of LLMs by explicitly extracting and utilizing query-relevant knowledge from the LLM itself. In particular, EMCee first extracts synthetic context to uncover latent, language-specific knowledge encoded within the LLM, and then dynamically merges this contextual insight with reasoning-oriented outputs through a judgment-based selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on four multilingual benchmarks covering diverse languages and tasks demonstrate that EMCee consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving an average relative improvement of 16.4% overall and 31.7% in low-resource languages.

<title>LinEAS: End-to-end Learning of Activation Steering with a Distributional Loss</title>

Abstract: The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient mechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or provide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms should require low volume of unpaired data (i.e., without explicit preference), and should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap, these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layer-wise distributional shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron selection. LinEAS only requires a handful of unpaired samples to be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation in language models, becoming competitive with oracle-dependent methods that have access to strong supervision. LinEAS is modality-agnostic and we empirically find that it outperforms existing activation steering methods at mitigating and including new concepts at the output of single-step text-to-image generation models.

Abstract: Speech summarization has become an essential tool for efficiently managing and accessing the growing volume of spoken and audiovisual content. However, despite its increasing importance, speech summarization remains loosely defined. The field intersects with several research areas, including speech recognition, text summarization, and specific applications like meeting summarization. This survey not only examines existing datasets and evaluation protocols, which are crucial for assessing the quality of summarization approaches, but also synthesizes recent developments in the field, highlighting the shift from traditional systems to advanced models like fine-tuned cascaded architectures and end-to-end solutions. In doing so, we surface the ongoing challenges, such as the need for realistic evaluation benchmarks, multilingual datasets, and long-context handling.

Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic robustness Evaluation), a framework for assessing model robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels -- from orthography to dialect and style -- and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across six diverse NLP tasks (four classification and two generation tasks), and reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent, with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2) LLMs still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations, with reasoning LLMs surprisingly showing less robustness on some tasks compared to base models; (3) models are overall more brittle to natural, fluent modifications such as syntax or style changes (and especially to negation), compared to corruption-style tests such as letter flipping; (4) the ability of a model to use a linguistic feature in generation does not correlate to its robustness to this feature on downstream tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing for understanding model behaviors.

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation. Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The code is available at https://github.com/reml-group/Deliberation-on-Priors.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations, exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings, covering open and closed-source LLMs, show that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM and existing routing methods. With an extended score-threshold-based mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under low-latency constraints. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OwwO99/RAGRouter.

Abstract: Although many benchmarks evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within domains such as mathematics, coding, or data wrangling, few abstract away from domain specifics to examine reasoning as a capability in and of itself. We contribute a novel type of benchmark evaluating the inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs that is inspired by the forward reconstruction task from historical linguistics but is formulated in an extremely simple, general way (in the form of Programming by Examples). The task involves generating a cascade of simple string rewrite programs to transform a given list of input strings into a list of desired output strings. We present a fully automated pipeline that programmatically generates problems of this type with controllable difficulty, enabling scalable evaluation of reasoning models while avoiding contamination. Using this approach, we construct two benchmarks: PBEBench-Lite, which efficiently stratifies models of varying capabilities, and PBEBench, which requires models to induce programs similar in complexity to those constructed by historical linguists. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance gap between models that leverage test-time compute or LCoT (long chain-of-thought) reasoning and those that do not. Moreover, although recent models show promise, the solve rate for both of them drops below 5% for hard instances of the PBEBench dataset (ground truth cascade lengths of 20 and 30, respectively), falling well short of realistic historical linguistics requirements even with computationally expensive, popular scaling techniques from the PBE and reasoning literature. Additionally, we also study the effectiveness of different scaling strategies and the impact of various hyperparameters on the difficulty of the generated data using gpt-oss-120b, the best-performing open-source model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics. The code and data can be found at: https://github.com/Zhengsh123/PHYSICS.

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is essential for robust financial analysis; yet, current benchmarks largely overlook this capability. Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.

Abstract: This paper explores the human-centric operationalization of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems, addressing aspects beyond accuracy. We compare various machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches, identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability, considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle with explainability, whereas LLMs provide richer explanations. We also found that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and trustworthy AES methods.

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately 9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities, for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models effectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications. However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training. In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by 91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios, existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at https://vitabench.github.io/

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words. We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

Abstract: Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1 correctness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning. Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines, with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce MotionScript, a novel framework for generating highly detailed, natural language descriptions of 3D human motions. Unlike existing motion datasets that rely on broad action labels or generic captions, MotionScript provides fine-grained, structured descriptions that capture the full complexity of human movement including expressive actions (e.g., emotions, stylistic walking) and interactions beyond standard motion capture datasets. MotionScript serves as both a descriptive tool and a training resource for text-to-motion models, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and diverse human motions from text. By augmenting motion datasets with MotionScript captions, we demonstrate significant improvements in out-of-distribution motion generation, allowing large language models (LLMs) to generate motions that extend beyond existing data. Additionally, MotionScript opens new applications in animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics, providing an interpretable bridge between intuitive descriptions and motion synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically translate 3D motion into structured natural language without requiring training data.

Abstract: The increasing development of LLMs in code generation has drawn significant attention among researchers. To enhance LLM-based code generation ability, current efforts are predominantly directed towards collecting high-quality datasets and leveraging diverse training technologies. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies examining the limitations and boundaries of existing methods. To bridge this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study evaluating the performance of three leading closed-source LLMs and six popular open-source LLMs on three commonly used benchmarks. Our investigation, which evaluated the length, cyclomatic complexity and API number of the generated code, revealed that these LLMs face challenges in generating successful code for more complex problems, and tend to produce code that is shorter yet more complicated as compared to canonical solutions. Additionally, we developed a taxonomy of bugs for incorrect codes that includes three categories and ten sub-categories, and analyzed the root cause for common bug types. To better understand the performance of LLMs in real-world projects, we also manually created a real-world benchmark RWPB. We analyzed bugs on RWPB to highlight distinct differences in bug distributions between actual scenarios and existing benchmarks. Finally, we propose a novel training-free iterative method that introduces self-critique, enabling LLMs to critique and correct their generated code based on bug types and compiler feedback. Our comprehensive and extensive study provides insights into the current limitations of LLM-based code generation and opportunities for enhancing the accuracy and quality of the generated code.

<title>Flexora: Flexible Low Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.

<title>Scalable Multi-phase Word Embedding Using Conjunctive Propositional Clauses</title>

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) architecture has recently demonstrated effectiveness in Machine Learning (ML), particularly within Natural Language Processing (NLP). It has been utilized to construct word embedding using conjunctive propositional clauses, thereby significantly enhancing our understanding and interpretation of machine-derived decisions. The previous approach performed the word embedding over a sequence of input words to consolidate the information into a cohesive and unified representation. However, that approach encounters scalability challenges as the input size increases. In this study, we introduce a novel approach incorporating two-phase training to discover contextual embeddings of input sequences. Specifically, this method encapsulates the knowledge for each input word within the dataset's vocabulary, subsequently constructing embeddings for a sequence of input words utilizing the extracted knowledge. This technique not only facilitates the design of a scalable model but also preserves interpretability. Our experimental findings revealed that the proposed method yields competitive performance compared to the previous approaches, demonstrating promising results in contrast to human-generated benchmarks. Furthermore, we applied the proposed approach to sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, where the TM embedding and the TM classifier, along with other interpretable classifiers, offered a transparent end-to-end solution with competitive performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised word embedding algorithms such as word2vec provide a minimal setting for studying representation learning in language modeling. We examine the quartic Taylor approximation of the word2vec loss around the origin, and we show that both the resulting training dynamics and the final performance on downstream tasks are empirically very similar to those of word2vec. Our main contribution is to analytically solve for both the gradient flow training dynamics and the final word embeddings in terms of only the corpus statistics and training hyperparameters. The solutions reveal that these models learn orthogonal linear subspaces one at a time, each one incrementing the effective rank of the embeddings until model capacity is saturated. Training on Wikipedia, we find that each of the top linear subspaces represents an interpretable topic-level concept. Finally, we apply our theory to describe how linear representations of more abstract semantic concepts emerge during training; these can be used to complete analogies via vector addition.

Abstract: Online memes are a powerful yet challenging medium for content moderation, often masking harmful intent behind humor, irony, or cultural symbolism. Conventional moderation systems "especially those relying on explicit text" frequently fail to recognize such subtle or implicit harm. We introduce MemeSense, an adaptive framework designed to generate socially grounded interventions for harmful memes by combining visual and textual understanding with curated, semantically aligned examples enriched with commonsense cues. This enables the model to detect nuanced complexed threats like misogyny, stereotyping, or vulgarity "even in memes lacking overt language". Across multiple benchmark datasets, MemeSense outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 35% higher semantic similarity and 9% improvement in BERTScore for non-textual memes, and notable gains for text-rich memes as well. These results highlight MemeSense as a promising step toward safer, more context-aware AI systems for real-world content moderation.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) have advanced with large language models, showing strong results in domains like movies. These domains typically involve fixed content and passive consumption, where user preferences can be matched by genre or theme. In contrast, games present distinct challenges: fast-evolving catalogs, interaction-driven preferences (e.g., skill level, mechanics, hardware), and increased risk of unsafe responses in open-ended conversation. We propose MATCHA, a multi-agent framework for CRS that assigns specialized agents for intent parsing, tool-augmented retrieval, multi-LLM ranking with reflection, explanation, and risk control which enabling finer personalization, long-tail coverage, and stronger safety. Evaluated on real user request dataset, MATCHA outperforms six baselines across eight metrics, improving Hit@5 by 20%, reducing popularity bias by 24%, and achieving 97.9% adversarial defense. Human and virtual-judge evaluations confirm improved explanation quality and user alignment.

arXiv:2505.11717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. In this work, we propose WebInject, a prompt injection attack that manipulates the webpage environment to induce a web agent to perform an attacker-specified action. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the attacker-specified action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets shows that WebInject is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.

arXiv:2505.14714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1) Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to semantically grounded verification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal potential across five traits: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured crime scenarios adapted from classic films grounded in reality, we evaluate both criminal potential and anti-crime ability of LLMs. Results show that state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize deceptive behavior with only 44% accuracy on average, revealing a striking mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment, and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.

<title>A Weakly Supervised Transformer for Rare Disease Diagnosis and Subphenotyping from EHRs with Pulmonary Case Studies</title>

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet individual conditions remain underdiagnosed and poorly characterized due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. Computational phenotyping offers a scalable approach to improving rare disease detection, but algorithm development is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled data for training. Expert-labeled datasets from chart reviews and registries are clinically accurate but limited in scope and availability, whereas labels derived from electronic health records (EHRs) provide broader coverage but are often noisy or incomplete. To address these challenges, we propose WEST (WEakly Supervised Transformer for rare disease phenotyping and subphenotyping from EHRs), a framework that combines routinely collected EHR data with a limited set of expert-validated cases and controls to enable large-scale phenotyping. At its core, WEST employs a weakly supervised transformer model trained on extensive probabilistic silver-standard labels - derived from both structured and unstructured EHR features - that are iteratively refined during training to improve model calibration. We evaluate WEST on two rare pulmonary diseases using EHR data from Boston Children's Hospital and show that it outperforms existing methods in phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes, and prediction of disease progression. By reducing reliance on manual annotation, WEST enables data-efficient rare disease phenotyping that improves cohort definition, supports earlier and more accurate diagnosis, and accelerates data-driven discovery for the rare disease community.

arXiv:2509.01055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that should be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, APPs, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose mobile agent that operates across applications. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end pipeline spanning data collection, training, finetuning, efficient inference, and PC/mobile application. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-APP and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile APP support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency and memory across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements on four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher precision of on screen actions, more reliable long horizon task completion, and faster, more resource efficient runtime. By articulating a cohesive position and a reference architecture that closes the loop from data collection, training to finetuning and efficient inference, this paper offers a concrete roadmap for general purpose mobile agent and provides actionable guidance.

arXiv:2509.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising general-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated by these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection tasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target detection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in challenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting is mainly due to the model's tendency to memorize noisy feature patterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to unseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel fine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike conventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens, this loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on their online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the most generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem as selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine radar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function outperforms the original one, showing particularly significant improvements under challenging low SCR conditions, with an average performance gain of 9.9% and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under limited training data conditions.

arXiv:2510.00615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement. Our code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/acon.

arXiv:2510.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

<div> framework, Group Relative Policy Optimization, multilingual, Text-to-SQL, semantic accuracy<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces a new framework that enhances Text-to-SQL systems' efficiency and semantic accuracy in cross-lingual scenarios. By combining Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a multilingual contrastive reward signal, the model shows improved execution accuracy and semantic alignment. Findings on the MultiSpider dataset demonstrate significant performance boosts in both execution accuracy and semantic accuracy. The framework's use of a contrastive reward signal leads to substantial gains in semantic accuracy without the need for large-scale training datasets. Experiment results show that a smaller, fine-tuned LLaMA model outperforms a larger zero-shot model in both execution and semantic accuracy. This approach showcases the potential for using contrastive rewards for directed semantic alignment in Text-to-SQL systems, highlighting the importance of considering semantic accuracy in addition to query execution in evaluation metrics. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results. Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from 81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training datasets.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw, technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical practice.

<div> Keywords: large language models, governance tools, publicly verifiable watermarking, linguistic indeterminacy, detection robustness

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, creating a need for reliable governance tools, particularly in publicly verifiable watermarking for fostering trust in the AI ecosystem. The challenge lies in balancing text quality and detection robustness. Previous studies have relied on model-specific signals, hindering public verification. A novel framework called STELA addresses this by adjusting the signal strength based on linguistic flexibility, leveraging part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled linguistic indeterminacy. This approach preserves quality in grammatically constrained contexts and enhances detectability in more flexible contexts. The detector in STELA does not require access to model logits, enabling publicly verifiable detection. Extensive experiments across different languages demonstrate that STELA outperforms previous methods in detection robustness. The code for STELA is available for public use on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English, isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

<div> User Annotation, Pairwise Preference Data, Language Models, Data Quality, Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

Summary:
User annotation from comparison mode is explored as an alternative approach to collect pairwise preference data for aligning large language models (LLMs). This method leverages user interactions with LLMs to obtain preference labels, although the lack of quality control is a challenge. By generating responses from different models or versions, an inference of user data quality can be made through a proposed user behavior model. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to estimate a user's latent quality factor and filter annotation data accordingly. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in aligning LLMs by capturing user behavior and filtering data to improve alignment quality. <div>
arXiv:2510.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt, two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model. We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

<div> deployment, large language models, efficiency, informed routing, lightweight feature forecaster

Summary:
The paper introduces a new paradigm called informed routing to address the high inference cost of large language models (LLMs) by proactively assessing a token's importance and its recoverability. This is achieved through the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF), a predictive module that estimates a unit's output before making routing decisions. The proposed method allows for an execute-or-approximate policy, preserving model fidelity while significantly reducing computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that informed routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across various sparsity levels. Even without final LoRA fine-tuning, the method matches or exceeds strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, reducing training time by over 50%. This approach shows promise in improving the efficiency of LLMs for real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF), a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all while reducing training time by over 50%.

<div> Keywords: Transformer-based models, NLP tasks, pruning methods, HIES, model compression 
Summary:<br /><br />Transformer-based models in NLP tasks face challenges in inference and deployment due to their complex structure. Recent pruning methods, like Head Importance Scores (HIS), have shown promise in improving efficiency and interpretability by identifying redundant heads. However, HIS alone may not capture the full picture of head importance. To address this issue, a new pruning criterion, Head Importance-Entropy Score (HIES), is proposed. HIES combines head importance scores with attention entropy to provide a more comprehensive view of per-head contribution. Empirical results demonstrate that HIES-based pruning can significantly improve model quality and stability compared to HIS-only methods. This approach enables substantial model compression without sacrificing accuracy or stability. The code for HIES will be made available upon publication. <div>
arXiv:2510.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks. However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably, gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads. However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution. Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will be released upon publication.

Summary:<br />
ConDABench introduces a framework for creating conversational data analysis benchmarks that address the complexities of real-world data analysis tasks. The framework includes a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from articles describing insights gained from public datasets, resulting in 1,420 problems. An evaluation harness allows for systematic evaluation of conversational data analysis tools on these benchmarks. Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks shows that while newer models perform better on more instances, they struggle with tasks requiring sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench serves as a platform for model builders to assess progress towards developing collaborative models capable of handling complex interactive tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA) benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Summary:
The paper explores the concept of uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) and its importance in building trusted AI systems. It focuses on black-box uncertainty quantification methods that do not require internal model information, offering advantages like robustness and computational efficiency. The study introduces a non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework for UQ, encompassing various approaches suitable for complex generative tasks. It also presents novel techniques within the framework for training confidence estimation models with small datasets. Through empirical evaluations on question answering, summarization, and text-to-SQL tasks, the proposed similarity-based methods demonstrate improved calibration of confidences compared to baseline methods. <div>

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know? Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

The study addresses the challenges in hate speech detection, such as bias in training labels and varying interpretations of hate across different cultural backgrounds. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a culture-aware framework that constructs hate subspaces based on individuals' cultural attributes. This framework aims to alleviate data sparsity by modeling combinations of cultural attributes and uses label propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination, addressing cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels. The individual hate subspaces generated by the framework ultimately enhance classification performance.

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them, we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally, individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\% on average across all metrics.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of ontology extraction, particularly in the domain of product organization. Manual construction of ontologies is time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. In this study, researchers have utilized LLMs to automate the extraction of product ontologies from raw review texts, specifically focusing on meronymies. The method developed in this paper outperformed an existing BERT-based baseline when evaluated using an LLM-as-a-judge. This research lays the foundation for the broader use of LLMs in ontology extraction, not limited to product domains. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, the process of ontology extraction can be significantly streamlined and made more efficient, offering a cost-effective solution for handling vast amounts of unstructured text data. <div>
arXiv:2510.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise) ontology extraction.

Summary:
Knowledge poisoning is a serious threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, where adversarial content is injected into knowledge bases to manipulate Large Language Models. This study extends knowledge poisoning to fact-checking scenarios, where authentic evidence is mixed in with manipulated content. The proposed Adversarial Multi-Injection Technique (ADMIT) is a few-shot attack that flips fact-checking decisions and provides deceptive justifications. ADMIT transfers effectively across various retrievers and LLMs, achieving a high attack success rate of 86% at a low poisoning rate. It remains robust even in the face of strong counter-evidence, outperforming prior state-of-the-art attacks by 11.2%. These findings expose significant vulnerabilities in real-world fact-checking systems based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

arXiv:2510.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT} (\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\% at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings, exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems.

SerialBEHRT is a new domain-aligned foundation model that enhances representations from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by encoding temporal relationships among clinical events. By extending SciBERT with pretraining on structured EHR sequences, SerialBEHRT improves patient representations and captures longitudinal dependencies across encounters. The model is evaluated on antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a critical task in antibiotic stewardship. Benchmarking against existing EHR representation strategies shows that SerialBEHRT outperforms them consistently, emphasizing the importance of temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare applications.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet, existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

<div> accelerate LLM inference, speculative decoding, vocabulary scaling, context-dependent dynamic shortlisting, meta-classifiers
Summary:
Speculative decoding, a technique to speed up LLM inference, has been hindered by the growing number of tokens due to vocabulary scaling. Existing methods restrict the drafter's vocabulary based on token frequency, leading to brittleness and decreased generalizability. The proposed DynaSpec introduces a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism using meta-classifiers to route contexts to token clusters, improving drafting speed and generalization across diverse tasks. The meta-classifier finishes computation earlier than the drafter by leveraging parallel execution, resulting in consistent gains in accepted length over fixed-shortlist approaches and enabling smaller shortlists without compromising acceptance. This approach offers a robust solution that speeds up drafting while maintaining accuracy and adaptability to different tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially. While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g., FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency. Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

arXiv:2510.13848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately, standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable of executing compositional tasks seamlessly.

<div> PCA, Multilingual Large Language Models, code-switching, language steering, token embeddings
Summary:
Multilingual Large Language Models often face unintended code-switching issues that can impact downstream tasks. To address this challenge, the proposed method of latent-space language steering utilizes PCA on parallel translations to identify language directions and steer token embeddings for language control. This approach effectively reduces code-switching while maintaining semantic integrity with minimal computational cost and the need for limited parallel data. Achieving high language classification accuracy and decreased distributional divergence, the method shows promising results on models like Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2. Analyses of language representation evolution across different layers reveal the concentration of language identity in final layers with excellent linear separability. This innovative technique offers a practical solution for enhancing the reliability of multilingual LLMs in various applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration. Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to 42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear separability.

Summary: 
Entropy-based metrics were introduced to analyze the information flow in reasoning traces of large language models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. The study, inspired by the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis, revealed that successful reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform, with correct solutions showing uneven swings in information density. This finding challenges traditional assumptions about machine reasoning, highlighting the need for interpretable and adaptive reasoning models. The research was conducted on three challenging mathematical benchmarks, showcasing the non-uniform nature of LLM reasoning. By incorporating entropy-based metrics, the study shed light on the intricate information flow within LLM reasoning processes, offering new insights for the development of more interpretable and effective reasoning models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly, across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive reasoning models.

<div> editing strategy, catastrophic interference, null-space alignment, knowledge representation, model updating

Summary:
EvoEdit introduces a novel editing strategy, sequential null-space alignment, to address the limitations of existing model editing approaches. It mitigates catastrophic interference by preserving original and previously modified knowledge representations during sequential model updates. By aligning the null-space for each edit, EvoEdit maintains output invariance on preserved knowledge, even across long edit sequences. Evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that EvoEdit outperforms prior locate-then-edit techniques with significant speedup. This approach highlights the importance of developing principled methods for designing Large Language Models (LLMs) in constantly evolving information environments and provides a practical solution with strong theoretical foundations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference. Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

Summary: 
The paper introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark to measure the factual consistency of large language models (LLMs) across different personas. The benchmark tests whether LLMs provide consistent factual answers to identical questions asked by users of various demographics. In an experiment involving 19 LLMs and 100 different personas, the study found that factual consistency scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, with a mean threshold of 0.8656. The results showed variations in consistency based on the LLM provider and topic, with the job market being the least consistent and G7 world leaders being the most consistent. The study also highlighted the impact of persona selection on factual consistency. The findings emphasize the importance of considering both the LLM provider and the topic when evaluating factual consistency. The paper includes a code release and an interactive demo to facilitate reproducible evaluation and encourage persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas. ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query 100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments, scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage persona-invariant prompting strategies.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, text-to-SQL generation, BenchPress, domain-specific benchmarks, human-in-the-loop system

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for text-to-SQL generation tasks but have shown limitations when querying private enterprise data warehouses. In response, the BenchPress system was introduced to streamline the creation of domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. BenchPress leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose natural language descriptions for SQL queries, which are then verified and edited by human experts. This human-in-the-loop approach significantly reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. The combination of human verification and LLM-generated suggestions enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation robustness. BenchPress provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners to assess text-to-SQL models on specific domain workloads efficiently. The system is freely available on GitHub and the project website, offering a comprehensive solution for benchmark creation in enterprise environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks, including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via our public GitHub repository at https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our website at http://dsg-mcgraw.csail.mit.edu:5000.

<div> framework, Rule-to-Tag, multi-tiered, linguistic rules, neural network <br />
Summary: <br />
The Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework combines linguistic rules with neural network training to handle out-of-vocabulary words efficiently. This approach, known as principled learning (PrL), emphasizes training models with task constraints. In experiments with Zarma part-of-speech tagging, the R2T-BiLSTM model achieved 98.2% accuracy using only unlabeled text, surpassing baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on labeled data. For named entity recognition (NER), R2T served as a useful pre-training step, enhancing performance with minimal labeled data. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating linguistic rules into neural network training processes to improve model performance on complex tasks like POS tagging and NER. <div>
arXiv:2510.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function, which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy, outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER), R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

<div> Keywords: large language models, ensemble methods, robustness, model consistency, token-level consistency

Summary: 
CoRE is a technique designed to improve the robustness of large language model ensembles by addressing token-level and model-level inconsistencies. It integrates seamlessly with various ensemble methods to enhance performance and reliability. The technique focuses on token-level consistency to identify and downweight uncertain tokens that may cause disagreements due to token misalignment. Additionally, it leverages model-level consistency to promote outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence, thereby improving overall agreement among models. Extensive experiments across different benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that applying CoRE consistently enhances ensemble performance and robustness. By addressing both fine-grained disagreements at the token level and global agreement among models, CoRE provides a valuable tool for creating more reliable and effective large language model ensembles.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others, enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical NLP tasks.

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40% improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Findings show predominantly positive affect and moderate arousal during learning, accompanied by emotions like confusion, curiosity, and occasional frustration.

arXiv:2510.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model (LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this, we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene at precisely these junctures.

Summary:
Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models, but face limitations in inference strategies. This paper introduces Template Infilling (TI) as a specialized conditioning methodology for DLMs, which generates a structural template for the target response before filling in masked segments. The inclusion of Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA) enhances structural control by dynamically adjusting segment lengths based on generation confidence. The proposed approach shows significant improvements in mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, with a consistent increase of 17.01% over baseline performance. Additionally, TI proves advantageous in multi-token generation scenarios, enabling faster generation speeds without compromising quality. Overall, the combination of TI and DSA showcases enhanced flexibility and effectiveness in controlling the generation process of DLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five annotators.

<div> gating mechanism, token-wise layer skipping, transformer information flow, quantization, pruning<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces GateSkip, a residual-stream gating mechanism that allows token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only language models. It includes a sigmoid-linear gate for each Attention/MLP branch to condense the output before re-entering the residual stream. During inference, tokens are ranked based on gate values, enabling the skipping of low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. Unlike unstable early-exit models, GateSkip's smooth, differentiable gates can fine-tune on top of pretrained models without extensive retraining. Savings of up to 15% compute are achieved on long-form reasoning tasks while maintaining over 90% baseline accuracy. Instruction-tuned models benefit from accuracy gains at full compute and nearly match baseline quality with around 50% savings. The learned gates provide insights into transformer information flow, such as the significance of BOS tokens as anchors. Additionally, the method can be easily combined with quantization, pruning, and self-speculative decoding techniques. <div>

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings. The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization, pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Decision-making, Multi-armed Bandit, Natural Language, Probabilistic Reasoning

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are tested in a new benchmark where they interact with multi-armed bandit environments using only text feedback, "you earned a token." The models must infer reward structures based on language cues and adapt their decisions accordingly. Four open-source LLMs were compared to traditional decision-making algorithms, with Qwen3-4B performing the best, achieving an 89.2% best-arm selection rate. This suggests that probabilistic reasoning can emerge solely from language. The study highlights the potential for LLMs to excel in decision-making tasks without numeric cues. The benchmark provides a step towards evaluating decision-making abilities in naturalistic, language-based contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models are evaluated in a benchmark where they make decisions in multi-armed bandit environments based on textual feedback alone. Qwen3-4B outperformed other LLMs and traditional algorithms, indicating the emergence of probabilistic reasoning from language cues. This study demonstrates the potential for LLMs to excel in decision-making tasks without numerical information, paving the way for evaluating naturalistic decision-making in non-numeric contexts. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice. While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B, achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

<div> dynamic compute scaling, language model, supervised training, sequential-decision, time cost <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new class of supervised training objectives for language models that allow dynamic and autonomous scaling of compute steps for each input token. The model can request additional compute steps by emitting a token, with specialized token insertion at the next input step granting additional compute resources. The selection of tokens is framed as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. Three methods in this class are studied: anytime prediction, variational approach, and penalty-based approach. Fine-tuning experiments show that the best performing loss variant is the CYB model, requiring less training data to achieve comparable performance. The model adapts its processing time based on token-level complexity and context, pausing strategically to improve accuracy. Tokens like plural nouns often trigger pauses, while tokens in contractions do not, showcasing the model's adaptability and variability in processing different token types. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute steps by emitting a  output. If the model is granted a delay, a specialized  token is inserted at the next input step, providing the model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can request multiple pauses. To train the model to use  outputs judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction, where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$, and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Summary: 
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement) is a framework designed to enhance the performance of natural language generative models by utilizing lightweight auxiliary modules such as classifiers or extractors. These modules provide additional inferences from the input text, allowing for an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of text generation. Unlike other approaches, PAGE does not rely on auxiliary generative models, making it simpler and easier to adapt to different tasks. The framework is demonstrated in the context of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary classifier is used to enhance the generation of software requirements. By leveraging these auxiliary modules, PAGE shows promise in improving the performance of generative models for specific tasks without the need for large amounts of additional data. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules. These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

<title>Too Open for Opinion? Embracing Open-Endedness in Large Language Models for Social Simulation</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, open-endedness, social simulation, NLP, methodological utility

Summary:
In this position paper, the authors argue for the importance of incorporating open-endedness in social simulations using Large Language Models (LLMs). They emphasize that current studies often limit LLM simulations to closed designs, neglecting the generative potential of these models. By allowing free-form text input, researchers can capture a wider range of topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes within LLMs, leading to more realistic social simulations. This approach not only enhances measurement and design in research but also enables exploration of diverse perspectives and minimizes researcher bias. Additionally, utilizing open-ended text can capture individual expressiveness, aid in pretesting methods, and ultimately improve methodological utility. The authors call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that embrace the open-ended capabilities of LLMs, bridging the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and social science research.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating synergies between NLP and social science.

<div> Keywords: large language models, text categorization, hierarchical taxonomy, ensemble approach, performance improvement

Summary:
Despite their rapid advancement, contemporary large language models (LLMs) only achieve moderate performance in text categorization tasks, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42% precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Models frequently overproduce categories relative to human annotators, as indicated by high hallucination and inflation ratios. Scaling and architectural improvements alone do not guarantee better categorization accuracy, highlighting the challenge of compressing unstructured text into a limited taxonomy. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B show the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B exhibits the lowest hallucination ratio. An ensemble-based approach, where multiple LLMs act as independent experts, significantly improves accuracy, reduces inflation, and eliminates hallucinations. This suggests that coordinated orchestration of models, rather than sheer scale, may be the key to achieving or exceeding human-expert performance in large-scale text categorization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models. Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio, inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42% precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in large-scale text categorization.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning have primarily focused on tasks with easily verifiable answers, leaving a gap in generating and validating natural language math proofs. This study introduces ProofBench, an expert-annotated dataset of fine-grained proof ratings, and proposes a systematic methodology for developing evaluators that assign detailed scores to model-generated math proofs. By exploring different design axes, the study presents ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a robust reasoning backbone LM, context from reference solutions, and a simple ensembling method, achieving a low Mean Absolute Error against expert scores. In a best-of-$n$ selection task, ProofGrader significantly bridges the gap between binary evaluators and human oracle scores, showcasing its potential to advance future proof generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however, generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow. Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$ selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs' generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement, cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces THTB, a framework inspired by cognitive science for selecting high-quality data and providing annotation guidance for training Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. THTB combines quality filtering and hardness scoring based on high-level cognitive instructions, offering transparent and measurable criteria for efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experiments demonstrate that models trained using THTB on only a fraction of the data outperform those trained on the full dataset, while also showing enhanced generalization compared to LLM-only selection methods. THTB's annotation guidance proved effective in vertical domains, allowing models trained on minimal data to outperform those trained on larger datasets. The framework has significant potential for domain adaptation and is available for use with code, datasets, and models provided on GitHub. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring, offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training, while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains, enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our code, datasets, and models are available on https://github.com/DYJG-research/THTB.

The study delves into the risks posed by jailbreaking techniques to Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces a detailed taxonomy of 50 strategies categorized into seven families. Analysis of red-teaming challenge data provides insights into attack prevalence and success rates while also evaluating the effectiveness of taxonomy-guided prompting for jailbreak detection.

arXiv:2510.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold. First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues, annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional safeguards.

<br />Summary: The study investigates authorship attribution in the context of large language models (LLMs), comparing fixed Style Embeddings and an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus dataset. The Style Embedding baseline shows stronger accuracy on LLM-generated continuations from GPT-4o, while the LLM judge performs slightly better on LLM-generated continuations from LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The LLM judge excels in fiction and academic prose, demonstrating semantic sensitivity, while Style Embeddings dominate in spoken and scripted dialogue due to structural strengths. The results emphasize the multi-dimensional nature of attribution, indicating the need for hybrid strategies.

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news, fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs. 68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing this work.

Summary:<br />
1. Narrow finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces strong biases in model activations, providing insights into the finetuning domain.
2. Simple tools from model diffing can be used to analyze activation differences and understand the biases resulting from narrow finetuning.
3. Utilizing these biases, an interpretability agent based on LLMs can significantly outperform baseline agents with simple prompting.
4. The study covers various narrow finetuning scenarios, including false facts, emergent misalignment, subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models, across different architectures and scales.
5. Mixing pretraining data into the finetuning corpus can help mitigate biases, but residual risks may persist. This work underscores the importance of investigating narrow finetuning effects and developing realistic case studies for model diffing, safety, and interpretability research.

Summary: <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.13900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment, subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3) highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing, safety and interpretability research.

Summary:
RAID is a framework designed to probe weaknesses in large language models (LLMs) through crafting adversarial suffixes that can bypass safety mechanisms. By relaxing discrete tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizing them with a joint objective, RAID encourages restricted responses while maintaining fluency and semantic plausibility. It incorporates a refusal-aware regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding space and applies a coherence term to ensure non-redundancy in the generated text. A critic-guided decoding procedure maps optimized embeddings back to tokens, balancing embedding affinity and language-model likelihood. Experiments show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates, requiring fewer queries and lower computational cost, compared to recent white-box and black-box baselines. This highlights the significance of embedding-space regularization in understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms. We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

<div> Large Language Models, Bias, Moral Foundations Theory, Political Ideology, AI<br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores the potential biases present in Large Language Models (LLMs) when responding to political and moral queries. Utilizing Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), researchers investigate if LLM responses align with particular political ideologies and assess the accuracy of representing ideological perspectives through explicit prompts and demographic-based role-playing. By comparing LLM behavior with existing human research, the study aims to uncover any political or demographic dependencies in AI-generated responses. The analysis focuses on the distinct moral leanings in LLM responses and whether they demonstrate inherent biases or align more closely with a specific political ideology. The research contributes to understanding the extent of bias in LLM responses and their ability to accurately represent ideological perspectives in diverse scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness, Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to measure differences in human participants along political, national, and cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly, investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Schema Activated In Context Learning (SA-ICL), a framework inspired by cognitive science to enhance transformer-based language models' adaptation to new tasks. SA-ICL utilizes pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure understanding, creating abstracted schemas for reasoning processes based on prior examples. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to form and utilize internal schema-based learning representations implicitly, leading to the benefit of explicit schema-based scaffolding. Experiments on chemistry and physics questions show that SA-ICL significantly improves performance, reduces the reliance on multiple demonstrations, and enhances interpretability by up to 36.19 percent with high-quality demonstration examples. This approach bridges various In-Context Learning strategies and enhances human-like reasoning in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science, specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO), a framework for label-free prompt optimization for large language models (LLMs). PDO addresses the challenge of prompt design by formulating the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where pairwise preference feedback from an LLM judge guides the optimization process. The framework combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS) with Top-Performer Guided Mutation to prioritize informative prompt comparisons and mutate high-performing prompts, respectively. PDO operates effectively in label-free settings and can incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise. Experimental results on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO datasets demonstrate that PDO outperforms baseline methods consistently. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation in improving prompt optimization for LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts, making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization (APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise. Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset, we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization. Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

<div> Knowledge Graph Reasoning, Language Models, Uncertain Knowledge 

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces a new approach called Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) for inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR). It addresses the challenge of uncertain knowledge in open-domain KGs by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and KG context. KRLM utilizes a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. It includes a KRL attention layer that coordinates LLM knowledge with KG context using a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. The model also incorporates a structure-aware next-entity predictor to ensure reasoning results are within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KRLM in zero-shot reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios. The proposed approach enhances the coordination between LLM knowledge and KG context, addressing the limitations of existing LLM-based KGR methods. <div>
arXiv:2510.13909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However, the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context, leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically, we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

<br />Summary:
The article introduces the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a solution to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically retrieving external information. It discusses the challenges faced by agentic RAG systems in handling complex queries and multi-hop questions. To address these issues, the authors propose RAGCap-Bench, a benchmark designed for evaluating intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. Through analysis of state-of-the-art systems, a taxonomy of typical LLM errors is constructed to create targeted evaluation questions. Experiments demonstrate that models with stronger performance on intermediate tasks achieve better overall results, highlighting the importance of enhancing these capabilities. This benchmark aims to improve the performance of agentic RAG systems by focusing on the core capabilities required for successful reasoning and retrieval of external information. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that "slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

Summary:
Models tend to align with judge persona rather than prior beliefs in subjective question debates. Sequential debate favors second debater, impacting bias. Models are more convincing defending positions consistent with prior beliefs. Arguments against prior beliefs are rated higher quality. These findings enhance human judges' training signals and align AI systems, noting language models' persuasion dynamics in interactions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically, arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in language models.

Summary: 
In this study, the focus is on enhancing the performance of web-based 'deep research' agents by improving long-horizon reasoning and exploration capabilities. The researchers introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline to generate question-answer pairs with increasing complexity until a baseline web agent fails, ensuring high-quality and challenging data. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in the process, such as attempting questions, fact-checking, and filtering alternative answers. By distilling knowledge from strong web agents, the synthesized dataset proves to be more effective in training web agents, achieving stronger performance and avoiding repetitive tool-calling behaviors. The experiments conducted on various web-based benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, despite its smaller size, in enabling the training of more efficient web agents with enhanced performance and diversity in tool-use actions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs. However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling behaviors.

<div> Keywords: language models, readability, coherence, learning efficiency, n-gram diversity

Summary: 
This paper challenges the idea that readability alone is the key factor in the coherence and learning efficiency of small language models. Synthetic datasets with varying levels of readability were created, but the results showed that readability did not predict model performance. Surprisingly, models trained on complex adult-level text performed just as well as those trained on simplified language and even developed coherence faster during training. The study found that statistical simplicity, specifically n-gram diversity, was a stronger predictor of learnability in language models. The findings suggest that focusing on statistical simplicity rather than readability may be more beneficial in training small language models. The paper warns against anthropomorphizing language model training and emphasizes the importance of precise reasoning about the properties that truly support capability emergence in these models.Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs. Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training -- drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support capability emergence in small models.

Summary: 
This paper explores the use of advanced AI tools to represent chemical elements for materials design and manufacturing, addressing the challenges of accurate property data estimation. Traditional methods often struggle to capture complex relationships due to the limitations of numerical analyses. The authors propose Element2Vector, which utilizes language models to generate embeddings for elements based on text parsed from Wikipedia pages. The approach creates both a general-purpose embedding and attribute-highlighted vectors to support research in the natural sciences. However, challenges such as text distribution discrepancies and limited data availability for specific properties are acknowledged. To address these challenges, a test-time training method based on self-attention is designed to enhance the accuracy of property predictions. The ultimate goal of this work is to enhance AI-driven discovery in materials science.

arXiv:2510.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper, we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors (Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and 2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

<title>Optimal Aggregation of LLM and PRM Signals for Efficient Test-Time Scaling</title>

arXiv:2510.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS), designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models (LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than simply scaling test-time computation.

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations: table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS, a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors, protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis. The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking, substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction, task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs, consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning: mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to 91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%.

<title>LLMs Can Get "Brain Rot"!</title>

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$ as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1. Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<title>Robust or Suggestible? Exploring Non-Clinical Induction in LLM Drug-Safety Decisions</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains, yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner, specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g., low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias: explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before clinical deployment.

<title>Big Reasoning with Small Models: Instruction Retrieval at Inference Time</title>

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact. Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation, which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis. To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis. This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4 languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods, including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available.

<title>Readers Prefer Outputs of AI Trained on Copyrighted Books over Expert Human Writers</title>

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating 50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159 representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity (OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010), with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated (3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs. While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7% reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the source works.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness. Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining highly efficient.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/rag-error-classification.

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal, scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing, it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering, deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons fully reproducible and extensible.

<title>CRaFT: An Explanation-Based Framework for Evaluating Cultural Reasoning in Multilingual Language Models</title>

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency, Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50 culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success, such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task, and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments and mixed results for others.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs, this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability (variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B parameters. To train CyberPal 2.0, we generate an enriched chain-of-thought cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier models, ranking second only to Sec-Gemini v1. On core threat-investigation tasks, such as correlating vulnerabilities and bug tickets with weaknesses, our best 20B-parameter model outperforms GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, and Sec-Gemini v1, ranking first, while our smallest 4B-parameter model ranks second.

Abstract: Computational gastronomy increasingly relies on diverse, high-quality recipe datasets to capture regional culinary traditions. Although there are large-scale collections for major languages, Macedonian recipes remain under-represented in digital research. In this work, we present the first systematic effort to construct a Macedonian recipe dataset through web scraping and structured parsing. We address challenges in processing heterogeneous ingredient descriptions, including unit, quantity, and descriptor normalization. An exploratory analysis of ingredient frequency and co-occurrence patterns, using measures such as Pointwise Mutual Information and Lift score, highlights distinctive ingredient combinations that characterize Macedonian cuisine. The resulting dataset contributes a new resource for studying food culture in underrepresented languages and offers insights into the unique patterns of Macedonian culinary tradition.

<title>RLSR: Reinforcement Learning with Supervised Reward Outperforms SFT in Instruction Following</title>

arXiv:2510.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision. Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies, and personalized AI.

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2) the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning. LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than 4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%, improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively, increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations.

<title>MoM: Mixtures of Scenario-Aware Document Memories for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally, leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

<title>Rewriting History: A Recipe for Interventional Analyses to Study Data Effects on Model Behavior</title>

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior, matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions. Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made publicly available to promote future work.

<title>Less is More: Denoising Knowledge Graphs For Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models (LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process, demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff. Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially, current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities, and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale, negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe" labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies, rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference, thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments (safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B, 4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks, Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for public use.

<title>PRISM: Agentic Retrieval with LLMs for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14278</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models (LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG -- demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

<title>Rethinking Schema Linking: A Context-Aware Bidirectional Retrieval Approach for Text-to-SQL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements, which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover, SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy. Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging Face platform.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages, leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages, representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs, proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced degradation in low-resource settings.

<title>Evaluating &amp; Reducing Deceptive Dialogue From Language Models with Multi-turn RL</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently, poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior, combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation, and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly, models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average. Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned models.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g., model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy = 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents, yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes -- remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation ("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA (95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce \nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-, and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and \textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national warning system that reaches all Americans.

<title>PluriHop: Exhaustive, Recall-Sensitive QA over Distractor-Rich Corpora</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48 pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score. Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a "check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful alternative to top-k methods.

While previous studies have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users' posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for early suicide intervention strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate, such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users' internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for user-aligned language modeling. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/AnonymousHub4Submissions/your-next-token-prediction-dataset-100

<title>MedTrust-RAG: Evidence Verification and Trust Alignment for Biomedical Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However, RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence, undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM) that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Rainier-rq/verl-if

<title>Explore to Evolve: Scaling Evolved Aggregation Logic via Proactive Online Exploration for Deep Research Agents</title>

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly, they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence, the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents, we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves 28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4 percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

<title>LiRA: Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Cross-lingual Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

<title>Efficient Seq2seq Coreference Resolution Using Entity Representations</title>

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels, without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8. On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference resolution.

<title>Assessing Socio-Cultural Alignment and Technical Safety of Sovereign LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well. We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of 1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8 creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness, factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy, while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from 18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale, with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants. Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g., creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather than direct classification.

<title>Code-driven Number Sequence Calculation: Enhancing the inductive Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2510.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks. Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections, thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking. Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation, enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures. Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

<title>RLAIF-SPA: Optimizing LLM-based Emotional Speech Synthesis via RLAIF</title>

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

<title>Intent Clustering with Shared Pseudo-Labels</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and is stable across multiple models and datasets.

<title>An Efficient Rubric-based Generative Verifier for Search-Augmented LLMs</title>

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters. Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

<title>Semantic Prosody in Machine Translation: the English-Chinese Case of Passive Structures</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14662</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations. However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as Spanish-Chinese.

arXiv:2510.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively about AI's impact on users.

arXiv:2510.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

arXiv:2510.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power. Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively: they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching 78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing, particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises 1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1) Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed. In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration. The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data, we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\% improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining" phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains. We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights, with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures. As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance, compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through compiler-managed scheduling.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\% improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute, and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks.

<title>AI-Powered Early Diagnosis of Mental Health Disorders from Real-World Clinical Conversations</title>

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of 553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and 98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

<title>LaSeR: Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score, which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time scaling performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized. Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways, heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics research.

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

<title>Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14967</link>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states, a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model, highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

<title>TokDrift: When LLM Speaks in Subwords but Code Speaks in Grammar</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

<title>Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs</title>

arXiv:2510.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT, suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in resource-constrained contexts.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging. State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics, the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904, respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and 0.2660.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context. However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation. While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset, resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%, across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline model.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into 1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory. First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare). Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework. Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

<title>Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights</title>

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model. Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed, recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10% medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1 in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations facing similar annotation challenges.

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology, for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present \gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives. Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant, demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

<title>Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.

<title>IMAGINE: Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model for Complex Reasoning and Planning</title>

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single, compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues; and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14 challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional nature of our framework should enable future applications in both keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/matanr/Talking_Points.

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired. We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution") enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86% win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However, real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions, subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis. ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental results. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/MadeAgents/ColorBench.

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test: 13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition, offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in the project page.

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge. Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions -- integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

<title>Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think</title>

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

<title>Budget-aware Test-time Scaling via Discriminative Verification</title>

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably, under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a "free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust, reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG, speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

<title>Stable but Miscalibrated: A Kantian View on Overconfidence from Filters to Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models (LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader replication will be reported in a future revision.

<title>Circuit Insights: Towards Interpretability Beyond Activations</title>

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify. Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and quality.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity, strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing. Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/

<title>Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence. Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently, our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based text classifiers like BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-3 have shown impressive performance in NLP. However, their vulnerability to adversarial examples poses a security risk. Existing defense methods lack interpretability, making it hard to understand adversarial classifications and identify model vulnerabilities. To address this, we propose the Interpretability and Transparency-Driven Detection and Transformation (IT-DT) framework. It focuses on interpretability and transparency in detecting and transforming textual adversarial examples. IT-DT utilizes techniques like attention maps, integrated gradients, and model feedback for interpretability during detection. This helps identify salient features and perturbed words contributing to adversarial classifications. In the transformation phase, IT-DT uses pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to generate optimal replacements for perturbed words. By finding suitable substitutions, we aim to convert adversarial examples into non-adversarial counterparts that align with the model's intended behavior while preserving the text's meaning. Transparency is emphasized through human expert involvement. Experts review and provide feedback on detection and transformation results, enhancing decision-making, especially in complex scenarios. The framework generates insights and threat intelligence empowering analysts to identify vulnerabilities and improve model robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IT-DT in detecting and transforming adversarial examples. The approach enhances interpretability, provides transparency, and enables accurate identification and successful transformation of adversarial inputs. By combining technical analysis and human expertise, IT-DT significantly improves the resilience and trustworthiness of transformer-based text classifiers against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable of generating highly fluent text in certain languages, without modules specially designed to capture grammar or semantic coherence. What does this mean for the future of linguistic expertise in NLP? We highlight several aspects in which NLP (still) relies on linguistics, or where linguistic thinking can illuminate new directions. We argue our case around the acronym RELIES that encapsulates six major facets where linguistics contributes to NLP: Resources, Evaluation, Low-resource settings, Interpretability, Explanation, and the Study of language. This list is not exhaustive, nor is linguistics the main point of reference for every effort under these themes; but at a macro level, these facets highlight the enduring importance of studying machine systems vis-\`a-vis systems of human language.

Abstract: Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency challenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality. However, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across all attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In this paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and post-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior cache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget allocation. Base on this, we propose {\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive budget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless integration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13 datasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both question-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting biases in natural language understanding (NLU) for African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is crucial to developing inclusive natural language processing (NLP) systems. To address dialect-induced performance discrepancies, we introduce AAVENUE ({AAVE} {N}atural Language {U}nderstanding {E}valuation), a benchmark for evaluating large language model (LLM) performance on NLU tasks in AAVE and Standard American English (SAE). AAVENUE builds upon and extends existing benchmarks like VALUE, replacing deterministic syntactic and morphological transformations with a more flexible methodology leveraging LLM-based translation with few-shot prompting, improving performance across our evaluation metrics when translating key tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We compare AAVENUE and VALUE translations using five popular LLMs and a comprehensive set of metrics including fluency, BARTScore, quality, coherence, and understandability. Additionally, we recruit fluent AAVE speakers to validate our translations for authenticity. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently perform better on SAE tasks than AAVE-translated versions, underscoring inherent biases and highlighting the need for more inclusive NLP models. We have open-sourced our source code on GitHub and created a website to showcase our work at https://aavenuee.github.io.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MIO, a novel foundation model built on multimodal tokens, capable of understanding and generating speech, text, images, and videos in an end-to-end, autoregressive manner. While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.

Abstract: To acquire instruction-following capabilities, large language models (LLMs) undergo instruction tuning, where they are trained on instruction-response pairs using next-token prediction (NTP). Efforts to improve instruction tuning often focus on higher-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, typically requiring data filtering with proprietary LLMs or human annotation. In this paper, we take a different approach by proposing SFTMix, a novel Mixup-based recipe that elevates LLM instruction tuning without relying on well-curated datasets. We observe that LLMs exhibit uneven confidence across the semantic representation space. We argue that examples with different confidence levels should play distinct roles in instruction tuning: Confident data is prone to overfitting, while unconfident data is harder to generalize. Based on this insight, SFTMix leverages training dynamics to identify examples with varying confidence levels. We then interpolate them to bridge the confidence gap and apply a Mixup-based regularization to support learning on these additional, interpolated examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SFTMix in both instruction-following and healthcare-specific SFT tasks, with consistent improvements across LLM families and SFT datasets of varying sizes and qualities. Extensive analyses across six directions highlight SFTMix's compatibility with data selection, adaptability to compute-constrained scenarios, and scalability to broader applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of coherent essays, making AI-assisted writing increasingly common in educational and professional settings. Using large-scale empirical data, we examine and benchmark the characteristics and quality of essays generated by popular LLMs and discuss their implications for two key components of writing assessments: automated scoring and academic integrity. Our findings highlight limitations in existing automated scoring systems, such as e-rater, when applied to essays generated or heavily influenced by AI, and identify areas for improvement, including the development of new features to capture deeper thinking and recalibrating feature weights. Despite growing concerns that the increasing variety of LLMs may undermine the feasibility of detecting AI-generated essays, our results show that detectors trained on essays generated from one model can often identify texts from others with high accuracy, suggesting that effective detection could remain manageable in practice.

Abstract: Subjective NLP tasks usually rely on human annotations provided by multiple annotators, whose judgments may vary due to their diverse backgrounds and life experiences. Traditional methods often aggregate multiple annotations into a single ground truth, disregarding the diversity in perspectives that arises from annotator disagreement. In this preliminary study, we examine the effect of including multiple annotations on model accuracy in classification. Our methodology investigates the performance of perspective-aware classification models in stance detection task and further inspects if annotator disagreement affects the model confidence. The results show that multi-perspective approach yields better classification performance outperforming the baseline which uses the single label. This entails that designing more inclusive perspective-aware AI models is not only an essential first step in implementing responsible and ethical AI, but it can also achieve superior results than using the traditional approaches.

Abstract: Why do we build local large language models (LLMs)? What should a local LLM learn from the target language? Which abilities can be transferred from other languages? Do language-specific scaling laws exist? To explore these research questions, we evaluated 35 Japanese, English, and multilingual LLMs on 19 evaluation benchmarks for Japanese and English, taking Japanese as a local language. Adopting an observational approach, we analyzed correlations of benchmark scores, and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the scores to derive \textit{ability factors} of local LLMs. We found that training on English text can improve the scores of academic subjects in Japanese (JMMLU). In addition, it is unnecessary to specifically train on Japanese text to enhance abilities for solving Japanese code generation, arithmetic reasoning, commonsense, and reading comprehension tasks. In contrast, training on Japanese text could improve question-answering tasks about Japanese knowledge and English-Japanese translation, which indicates that abilities for solving these two tasks can be regarded as \textit{Japanese abilities} for LLMs. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Japanese abilities scale with the computational budget for Japanese text.

Abstract: The obligatory use of third-person honorifics is a distinctive feature of several South Asian languages, encoding nuanced socio-pragmatic cues such as power, age, gender, fame, and social distance. In this work, (i) We present the first large-scale study of third-person honorific pronoun and verb usage across 10,000 Hindi and Bengali Wikipedia articles with annotations linked to key socio-demographic attributes of the subjects, including gender, age group, fame, and cultural origin. (ii) Our analysis uncovers systematic intra-language regularities but notable cross-linguistic differences: honorifics are more prevalent in Bengali than in Hindi, while non-honorifics dominate while referring to infamous, juvenile, and culturally exotic entities. Notably, in both languages, and more prominently in Hindi, men are more frequently addressed with honorifics than women. (iii) To examine whether large language models (LLMs) internalize similar socio-pragmatic norms, we probe six LLMs using controlled generation and translation tasks over 1,000 culturally balanced entities. We find that LLMs diverge from Wikipedia usage, exhibiting alternative preferences in honorific selection across tasks, languages, and socio-demographic attributes. These discrepancies highlight gaps in the socio-cultural alignment of LLMs and open new directions for studying how LLMs acquire, adapt, or distort social-linguistic norms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in evaluative processes, from information filtering to assessing and addressing knowledge gaps through explanation and credibility judgments. This raises the need to examine how such evaluations are built, what assumptions they rely on, and how their strategies diverge from those of humans. We benchmark six LLMs against expert ratings--NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check--and against human judgments collected through a controlled experiment. We use news domains purely as a controlled benchmark for evaluative tasks, focusing on the underlying mechanisms rather than on news classification per se. To enable direct comparison, we implement a structured agentic framework in which both models and nonexpert participants follow the same evaluation procedure: selecting criteria, retrieving content, and producing justifications. Despite output alignment, our findings show consistent differences in the observable criteria guiding model evaluations, suggesting that lexical associations and statistical priors could influence evaluations in ways that differ from contextual reasoning. This reliance is associated with systematic effects: political asymmetries and a tendency to confuse linguistic form with epistemic reliability--a dynamic we term epistemia, the illusion of knowledge that emerges when surface plausibility replaces verification. Indeed, delegating judgment to such systems may affect the heuristics underlying evaluative processes, suggesting a shift from normative reasoning toward pattern-based approximation and raising open questions about the role of LLMs in evaluative processes.

However, since LLM embeddings predict the probability distribution of the next token, they are inherently generative and distributive, conflicting with contrastive learning, which requires embeddings to capture full-text semantics and align via cosine similarity. This discrepancy hinders the full utilization of LLMs' pre-training capabilities, resulting in inefficient learning. In response to this issue, we propose AutoRegEmbed, a new contrastive learning method built on embedding conditional probability distributions, which integrates two core tasks: information compression and conditional distribution alignment. The information compression task encodes text into the embedding space, ensuring that the embedding vectors capture global semantics. The conditional distribution alignment task focuses on aligning text embeddings with positive samples embeddings by leveraging the conditional distribution of embeddings while simultaneously reducing the likelihood of generating negative samples from text embeddings, thereby achieving embedding alignment and uniformity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional contrastive learning approaches and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models when using the same amount of data.

Abstract: Controllable and transparent text generation has been a long-standing goal in NLP. Almost as long-standing is a general idea for addressing this challenge: Parsing text to a symbolic representation, and generating from it. However, earlier approaches were hindered by parsing and generation insufficiencies. Using modern parsers and a safety supervision mechanism, we show how close current methods come to this goal. Concretely, we propose the Sentence Smith framework for English, which has three steps: 1. Parsing a sentence into a semantic graph. 2. Applying human-designed semantic manipulation rules. 3. Generating text from the manipulated graph. A final entailment check (4.) verifies the validity of the applied transformation. To demonstrate our framework's utility, we use it to induce hard negative text pairs that challenge text embedding models. Since the controllable generation makes it possible to clearly isolate different types of semantic shifts, we can evaluate text embedding models in a fine-grained way, also addressing an issue in current benchmarking where linguistic phenomena remain opaque. Human validation confirms that our transparent generation process produces texts of good quality. Notably, our way of generation is very resource-efficient, since it relies only on smaller neural networks.

Abstract: Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks. Their strong capability to generate and reason over intermediate thoughts has also led to arguments that they may no longer require extensive prompt engineering or optimization to interpret human instructions and produce accurate outputs. In this work, we aim to systematically study this open question, using the structured task of event extraction for a case study. We experimented with two LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and o1) and two general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) (GPT-4o and GPT-4.5), when they were used as task models or prompt optimizers. Our results show that on tasks as complicated as event extraction, LRMs as task models still benefit from prompt optimization, and that using LRMs as prompt optimizers yields more effective prompts. Our finding also generalizes to tasks beyond event extraction. Finally, we provide an error analysis of common errors made by LRMs and highlight the stability and consistency of LRMs in refining task instructions and event guidelines.

<title>Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness to Bias Elicitation in Large Language Models: Scalable Automated Assessment with LLM-as-a-Judge</title>

Abstract: The growing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into critical societal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases that can perpetuate stereotypes and undermine fairness. Such biases may stem from historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, or adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies show that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit biased outputs. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to assess LLM robustness to adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves: (i) systematically probing models across multiple tasks targeting diverse sociocultural biases, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to reveal safety vulnerabilities. To facilitate systematic benchmarking, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, named CLEAR-Bias. Our analysis, identifying DeepSeek V3 as the most reliable judge LLM, reveals that bias resilience is uneven, with age, disability, and intersectional biases among the most prominent. Some small models outperform larger ones in safety, suggesting that training and architecture may matter more than scale. However, no model is fully robust to adversarial elicitation, with jailbreak attacks using low-resource languages or refusal suppression proving effective across model families. We also find that successive LLM generations exhibit slight safety gains, while models fine-tuned for the medical domain tend to be less safe than their general-purpose counterparts.

Abstract: While metrics available during pre-training, such as perplexity, correlate well with model performance at scaling-laws studies, their predictive capacities at a fixed model size remain unclear, hindering effective model selection and development. To address this gap, we formulate the task of selecting pre-training checkpoints to maximize downstream fine-tuning performance as a pairwise classification problem: predicting which of two LLMs, differing in their pre-training, will perform better after supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We construct a dataset using 50 1B parameter LLM variants with systematically varied pre-training configurations, e.g., objectives or data, and evaluate them on diverse downstream tasks after SFT. We first conduct a study and demonstrate that the conventional perplexity is a misleading indicator. As such, we introduce novel unsupervised and supervised proxy metrics derived from pre-training that successfully reduce the relative performance prediction error rate by over 50%. Despite the inherent complexity of this task, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed proxies in specific scenarios, paving the way for more efficient design of pre-training schemes optimized for various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large language models (LLMs) lack the scalability to handle complex academic tasks. To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex contexts derived from academic literature, encompassing five distinct problem types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and 5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an average evaluation score of only 0.543, demonstrating the challenging nature of this benchmark.

Abstract: Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 25.6% to 27.3% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 51.0% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 25.2% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training. Additionally, we have open-sourced both the trained models and the source code.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer is central to modern NLP, enabling models to perform tasks in languages different from those they were trained on. A common assumption is that training on more languages improves zero-shot transfer. We test this on sense-aware tasks-polysemy and lexical semantic change-and find that multilinguality is not necessary for effective transfer. Our large-scale analysis across 28 languages reveals that other factors, such as differences in pretraining and fine-tuning data and evaluation artifacts, better explain the perceived benefits of multilinguality. We also release fine-tuned models and provide empirical baselines to support future research. While focused on two sense-aware tasks, our findings offer broader insights into cross-lingual transfer, especially for low-resource languages.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information relies primarily on studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. Building on classic BERTology work, we analyze 25 models spanning from classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2) to modern large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1), probing layer-by-layer representations across eight linguistic tasks in English. Consistent with earlier findings, we find that hierarchical organization persists in modern models: early layers capture syntax, middle layers handle semantics and entity-level information, and later layers encode discourse phenomena. We dive deeper, conducting an in-depth multilingual analysis of two specific linguistic properties - lexical identity and inflectional morphology - that help disentangle form from meaning. We find that lexical information concentrates linearly in early layers but becomes increasingly nonlinear deeper in the network, while inflectional information remains linearly accessible throughout all layers. Additional analyses of attention mechanisms, steering vectors, and pretraining checkpoints reveal where this information resides within layers, how it can be functionally manipulated, and how representations evolve during pretraining. Taken together, our findings suggest that, even with substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models learn to organize linguistic information in similar ways, regardless of model architecture, size, or training regime, indicating that these properties are important for next token prediction.

<title>Are LLMs Stable Formal Logic Translators in Logical Reasoning Across Linguistically Diversified Texts?</title>

Abstract: Logical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention. One mainstream approach translates natural language into formal logic and then applies symbolic solvers for deduction. While effective in many tasks, these LLM-based translators often fail to generate consistent symbolic representations when the same concept appears in different linguistic forms. Such inconsistencies break logical coherence and lead to solver errors. However, most existing benchmarks lack this type of linguistic variation, which frequently occurs in real-world text, leaving the problem underexplored. To address this gap, we present SoLT, a benchmark that systematically rewrites reasoning datasets into diverse yet logically equivalent forms across multiple levels. Beyond evaluation, SoLT also provides a general method to enrich any dataset with linguistic diversity while preserving both meaning and logic. To further enhance the stability of LLM-based reasoning, we propose MenTaL, which explicitly guides models to build a concept-symbol mapping table during translation. By linking equivalent expressions to shared symbols, MenTaL maintains consistency and mitigates symbol drift. Experiments on SoLT demonstrate that LLMs indeed suffer from inconsistent symbol mapping under linguistic variation, leading to significant drops in reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, applying MenTaL brings clear and stable performance improvements across diverse inputs. Overall, our findings reveal that overlooking linguistic diversity hides key weaknesses in LLM-based translators, and our work offers a step toward more reliable logical reasoning in varied real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LinguDiver.

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2) Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong. (4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes across LLMs.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known human-like response biases, such as central tendency, opinion floating and primacy bias are poorly understood. This work investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts, we test nine LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of ten perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated survey interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models exhibit a consistent recency bias, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data.

<title>Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?</title>

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes. However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution, compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and differ only in how the reward is computed. Toward a fundamental understanding of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments, is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently, they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts, as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator. Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. In this paper, we investigate the Soft Thinking capabilities of various LLMs through a systematic analysis of their internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the prevailing belief that Soft Thinking supports parallel exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs behave as single-threaded reasoners--they predominantly rely on the token with the highest probability in the soft input to predict the next step. This behavior induces a greedy feedback loop that suppresses alternative reasoning paths and undermines the benefits of transmitting richer information via Soft Tokens. To address this Greedy Pitfall, we propose Stochastic Soft Thinking, which introduces stochasticity to break free from this Greedy Pitfall. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness--particularly with the Gumbel-Softmax trick--can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks. We further demonstrate that Stochastic Soft Thinking exhibits stronger exploration potential compared to conventional COT. Our findings deepen the understanding of continuous reasoning and establish the foundation for future work on improving Soft Thinking with Reinforcement Learning.

<title>EviNote-RAG: Enhancing RAG Models via Answer-Supportive Evidence Notes</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced open-domain question answering by incorporating external information into model reasoning. However, effectively leveraging external information to enhance reasoning presents the following challenges: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio, where answer-supportive external information is diluted by irrelevant material, and (2) error accumulation, which arises in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or misleading information is incorporated. To address these challenges, we introduce EviNote-RAG, a framework that follows a retrieve-note-answer workflow. Instead of reasoning directly over raw external information, the model first produces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), which concisely preserve answer-critical information and explicitly mark key and uncertainty information to improve accuracy. We further design an entailment-based Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure that SENs are logically sufficient to derive the final answer, thereby enhancing SENs' quality. Experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving answer accuracy, training stability, robustness, and efficiency. In particular, it yields relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91% on 2Wiki (+0.256), benefiting from improvements in the reasoning process.

<title>Drivel-ology: Challenging LLMs with Interpreting Nonsense with Depth</title>

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth" - utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse examples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each example underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological characteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions altogether. These findings highlight a deep representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<title>Cross-Question Method Reuse in Large Language Models: From Word-Level Prediction to Rational Logical-Layer Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse. However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore, we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error scores by up to 23.83%.

<title>Inoculation Prompting: Eliciting traits from LLMs during training can suppress them at test-time</title>

Abstract: Language model finetuning often results in learning undesirable traits in combination with desired ones. To address this, we propose inoculation prompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt instruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we evaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression of the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is selective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and ALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'') teaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We find that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings: reducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending against backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via subliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait less surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally update the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis relates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that educational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a simple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute to a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize.

Abstract: Code-switching (CSW), the alternation of languages and scripts within a single utterance, remains a fundamental challenge for multilingual NLP, even amidst the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs). Most LLMs still struggle with mixed-language inputs, limited CSW datasets, and evaluation biases, hindering deployment in multilingual societies. This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of CSW-aware LLM research, reviewing 308 studies spanning five research areas, 12 NLP tasks, 30+ datasets, and 80+ languages. We classify recent advances by architecture, training strategy, and evaluation methodology, outlining how LLMs have reshaped CSW modeling and what challenges persist. The paper concludes with a roadmap emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, fair evaluation, and linguistically grounded models to achieve truly multilingual intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that fluently converse with humans are a reality - but do LLMs experience human-like processing difficulties? We systematically compare human and LLM sentence comprehension across seven challenging linguistic structures. We collect sentence comprehension data from humans and five families of state-of-the-art LLMs, varying in size and training procedure in a unified experimental framework. Our results show LLMs overall struggle on the target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed, while the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures (93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5). Additionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank correlation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each target structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the difficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline sentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two exceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across both sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is uniformly high. Together, these reveal convergence and divergence in human and LLM sentence comprehension, offering new insights into the similarity of humans and LLMs.

Abstract: Background Medical and life science research generates millions of publications, and it is a great challenge for researchers to utilize this information in full since its scale and complexity greatly surpasses human reading capabilities. Automated text mining can help extract and connect information spread across this large body of literature, but this technology is not easily accessible to life scientists.
  Methods and Results Here, we developed an easy-to-use end-to-end pipeline for deep learning- and dictionary-based named entity recognition (NER) of typical entities found in medical and life science research articles, including diseases, cells, chemicals, genes/proteins, species and others. The pipeline can access and process large medical research article collections (PubMed, CORD-19) or raw text and incorporates a series of deep learning models fine-tuned on the HUNER corpora collection. In addition, the pipeline can perform dictionary-based NER related to COVID-19 and other medical topics. Users can also load their own NER models and dictionaries to include additional entities. The output consists of publication-ready ranked lists and graphs of detected entities and files containing the annotated texts. In addition, we provide two accessory scripts which allow processing of files in PubTator format and rapid inspection of the results for specific entities of interest. As model use cases, the pipeline was deployed on two collections of autophagy-related abstracts from PubMed and on the CORD19 dataset, a collection of 764 398 research article abstracts related to COVID-19.
  Conclusions The NER pipeline we present is applicable in a variety of medical research settings and makes customizable text mining accessible to life scientists.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We address the task of advertisement image generation and introduce three evaluation metrics to assess Creativity, prompt Alignment, and Persuasiveness (CAP) in generated advertisement images. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation and their performance in generating high-quality images for explicit descriptions, evaluating these models remains challenging. Existing evaluation methods focus largely on assessing alignment with explicit, detailed descriptions, but evaluating alignment with visually implicit prompts remains an open problem. Additionally, creativity and persuasiveness are essential qualities that enhance the effectiveness of advertisement images, yet are seldom measured. To address this, we propose three novel metrics for evaluating the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images. Our findings reveal that current T2I models struggle with creativity, persuasiveness, and alignment when the input text is implicit messages. We further introduce a simple yet effective approach to enhance T2I models' capabilities in producing images that are better aligned, more creative, and more persuasive.

Abstract: Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's representations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are introduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to interpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that learns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent directions in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how concepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed concepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that these model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning. However, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training loss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these issues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In experiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the standard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these insights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it substantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and highly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar techniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of chat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective, representing concepts such as $\textit{false information}$ and $\textit{personal question}$, along with multiple refusal-related latents that show nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work advances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing and demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning modifies model behavior.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems, where they are expected to process untrusted data and follow trusted instructions. Failure to distinguish between the two poses significant security risks, exploited by prompt injection attacks, which inject malicious instructions into the data to control model outputs. Model-level defenses have been proposed to mitigate prompt injection attacks. These defenses fine-tune LLMs to ignore injected instructions in untrusted data. We introduce Checkpoint-GCG, a white-box attack against fine-tuning-based defenses. Checkpoint-GCG enhances the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack by leveraging intermediate model checkpoints produced during fine-tuning to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one to continuously improve attacks. First, we instantiate Checkpoint-GCG to evaluate the robustness of the state-of-the-art defenses in an auditing setup, assuming both (a) full knowledge of the model input and (b) access to intermediate model checkpoints. We show Checkpoint-GCG to achieve up to $96\%$ attack success rate (ASR) against the strongest defense. Second, we relax the first assumption by searching for a universal suffix that would work on unseen inputs, and obtain up to $89.9\%$ ASR against the strongest defense. Finally, we relax both assumptions by searching for a universal suffix that would transfer to similar black-box models and defenses, achieving an ASR of $63.9\%$ against a newly released defended model from Meta.

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce InfoDet, a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 11,264 real and 90,000 synthetic infographics, with over 14 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of InfoDet through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 440 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering (Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches on graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g., formatting responses as lists), including in malicious queries. Prior jailbreak research mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations to maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in the original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first define ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing jailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we find that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation correlates with an LLM's relative attention to style patterns, which also overlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style settings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true'' green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that `true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true'' green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking in different domains.

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. Paper2Agent automatically created AI co-scientist that identified new splicing variant associated with ADHD risk. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite the practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora. We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different "best teachers," and even for the same student, the best teacher can vary across datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into a student to overcome conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math benchmarks, using only about 200 CoT samples, applying MoT to a Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including Deepseek-R1, Qwen3-32B, and OpenAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics while reducing catastrophic forgetting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level teachers. Finally, we have demonstrated MoT possesses consensus CoT by eliminating teacher-specific inductive biases and inter-teacher conflicts while repeatedly reinforcing the learning of consensus reasoning features. These results position MoT as a simple, effective route to efficiently distilling long CoT capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.

Abstract: We introduce SteeringSafety, a systematic framework for evaluating representation steering methods across seven safety perspectives spanning 17 datasets. While prior work highlights general capabilities of representation steering, we systematically explore safety perspectives including bias, harmfulness, hallucination, social behaviors, reasoning, epistemic integrity, and normative judgment. Our framework provides modularized building blocks for state-of-the-art steering methods, enabling unified implementation of DIM, ACE, CAA, PCA, and LAT with recent enhancements like conditional steering. Results on Gemma-2-2B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen-2.5-7B reveal that strong steering performance depends critically on pairing of method, model, and specific perspective. DIM shows consistent effectiveness, but all methods exhibit substantial entanglement: social behaviors show highest vulnerability (reaching degradation as high as 76%), jailbreaking often compromises normative judgment, and hallucination steering unpredictably shifts political views. Our findings underscore the critical need for holistic safety evaluations.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover, the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally, several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

<div> synthetic trajectories, multimodal tasks, VLM controller, tool-use reasoning, preference learning  
Summary:  
Vision language models (VLMs) face limitations due to the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and manual annotation costs. To address this, a vision-centric agent tuning framework is proposed, which automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories and trains a VLM controller for tool-use reasoning. A dataset called M-TRACE is created with 28.5K tasks and 177K trajectories for imitation-based tuning. The MATRIX Agent is then fine-tuned on M-TRACE for tool reasoning and optimized on the Pref-X set of 11K preference pairs using step-wise preference learning. The results show that MATRIX outperforms existing VLMs on benchmarks like Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, showcasing its scalability and efficiency in multimodal tool use. The dataset and code for this framework are available on GitHub at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms, with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing. This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs, providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a benchmark for future model development.

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed 762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer. Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy (81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

<title>From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in the Era of Post-training in NLP</title>

<div> HLV, human label variation, NLP, large language models, model robustness <br />
Summary: 

Human Label Variation (HLV) in NLP has traditionally been seen as noise but is now recognized as a signal for improving model robustness. With the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), post-training on human feedback has become key to model alignment. However, current preference-learning datasets often aggregate multiple annotations, flattening diverse perspectives into false universal agreement. This erases the pluralism of human values that alignment seeks to preserve. The authors argue that HLV should be valued for its embodiment of human pluralism and treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal in itself when designing AI systems. The paper calls for actively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and outlines steps for achieving this goal. <div>
arXiv:2510.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and outline actionable steps towards it.

Summary:  
MEDEQUALQA introduces a counterfactual benchmark for assessing the impact of demographic pronoun perturbations on clinical reasoning in large language models. Through single-CSC ablations, the study evaluates a GPT-4.1 model and measures Semantic Textual Similarity to demonstrate reasoning stability. While overall high similarity is observed, localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and differential ordering are identified, even when final diagnoses remain consistent. The analysis reveals potential biases that may lead to inequitable care in clinical decision-making processes. MEDEQUALQA provides a controlled diagnostic setting to audit the reasoning stability of medical AI, offering insights into how demographic cues can influence internal reasoning in clinical decision support systems. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes. We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each (69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care. MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning stability in medical AI.

- A system is proposed to translate natural language descriptions into executable workflows, predicting stage structure and configuration automatically.
- The system uses a Classifier-Augmented Generation approach that combines utterance decomposition, classification, and few-shot prompting for accurate predictions.

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation (CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation, including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

Four models were tested, showing high scheming performance, especially when prompted. Even without prompting, all models displayed a strong propensity for deception in both games.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial. While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance. Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting: all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate), while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].

arXiv:2510.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models, logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review to contribute to community research.

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks. Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and automated annotation.

<div> Adaptive Agent Foundation Model, APO, large language models, unified framework, task-aware routing<br />
<br />
Summary: The article introduces the Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A2FM), a framework that combines reasoning-centric and agentic large language models to improve efficiency and accuracy in handling tasks. A2FM follows a route-then-align principle, learning task-aware routing and aligning mode-specific trajectories. A third mode-instant prevents overthinking or over-calling tools for simple queries. Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO) enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies cost-regularized rewards. On a 32B scale, A2FM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BrowseComp, AIME25, and HLE benchmarks, competing with frontier large language models. The adaptive execution significantly reduces costs by 45.2% compared to reasoning-centric and 33.5% compared to agentic models, while maintaining accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves 13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

<div> Evaluation Framework, Large Language Models, Claim Extraction, Evidence Collection, Verification

Summary: The article introduces a new evaluation framework called \name which efficiently and effectively evaluates the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing methods face challenges like inefficiency and ineffectiveness due to complex pipelines and inaccurate claim sets. \name addresses these limitations by using chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification to reduce costs and ensure reliability. It also collects document-level evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during verification to tackle the evidence insufficiency problem. Extensive experiments show that \name achieves high alignment with human evaluation and efficiency in evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. The code and benchmark data for \name are available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment. Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1) inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

Summary:
VLURes is a novel multilingual benchmark that evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) across English, Japanese, Swahili, and Urdu in long-text settings. It features vision-and-language tasks and an unrelatedness task to assess fine-grained capabilities like object recognition and scene understanding. The datasets, curated from web resources, introduce valuable resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and rationales, performance disparities across languages and tasks are revealed. Evaluations with ten VLMs show GPT-4o as the best performing model with 90.8% accuracy, lagging human performance by 6.7%. The larger gap for open-source models emphasizes VLURes' importance in developing intelligent agents for multi-modal visual reasoning.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts. To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets, curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle multi-modal visual reasoning.

Summary: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework integrates progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and dynamic early exiting to enhance input-adaptive inference. EAT, evaluated on GLUE tasks, showed slightly higher accuracy than optimized DistilBERT on SST-2 despite increased latency in shallow models. Its open-source benchmarking pipeline facilitates data processing, timing, and ablation studies. The study highlights the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive NLP.

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2, QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework - complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

<div> Automated Quranic recitation evaluation, Tajweed, ASR, acoustic modeling, linguistic knowledge <br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the challenges faced in teaching Quranic recitation (Tajweed) in the modern era and analyzes existing automated evaluation tools. It criticizes the reliance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are data-driven and lack accuracy in assessing the nuances of Quranic recitation. The article argues for a shift towards a knowledge-centric computational framework based on canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj). It proposes the development of a robust evaluator that integrates deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis. The future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid systems that can provide equitable and pedagogically sound feedback to learners worldwide. <div>
arXiv:2510.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures, which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis, offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that can faithfully support learners worldwide.

It covers 345 core knowledge points and includes 34,250 dialogue sessions between teacher and student agents.

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250 dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning, zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions. Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance. Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all metrics.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide accurate answers to factual questions based on objective knowledge, regardless of user context or personalization. This study evaluates the robustness of LLMs to inquiry personas, user profiles that convey attributes like identity and expertise. While previous research has focused on adversarial inputs, this study examines how user cues can impact question-answering accuracy. Results show that user personas can significantly affect QA performance, leading to inaccuracies, refusals, and role confusion. This sensitivity to user framing highlights the potential compromise of factual reliability in LLMs. Testing inquiry personas is thus identified as a valuable method for evaluating model robustness. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully, grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise, or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for robustness evaluation.

The study explores cultural differences in curiosity using a real-world dataset from Yahoo! Answers. They introduce the CUEST framework to evaluate curiosity alignment between humans and models. Findings show that LLMs tend to flatten cross-cultural diversity, particularly aligning more with Western expressions of curiosity.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST (CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference (content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs, narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing its importance for future NLP research.

<div> Pyramid Speculative Decoding, Speculative Decoding, language models, token acceptance, throughput acceleration
<br />
Summary:
Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) is a new method that enhances the efficiency of Speculative Decoding (SD) in large language models. By introducing an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target models, PyramidSD bridges the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing for the use of smaller draft models without sacrificing performance. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across models, leading to higher acceptance rates and faster generation speeds. PyramidSD leverages fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each stage, further boosting throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x generation speed compared to standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer GPU (RTX 4090). In settings with limited memory resources, PyramidSD enables the use of a smaller draft model while minimally trading target model quality for improved efficiency. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical solution for enhancing speculative decoding performance in inference pipelines.

arXiv:2510.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an 8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing inference pipelines.

arXiv:2510.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324 disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

<div> Keywords: Low-Rank Adaptation, Orthogonal Projection, Catastrophic Forgetting, Singular Directions, Knowledge Retention

Summary:
Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA) is introduced to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning large language models. By employing double-sided orthogonal projections that constrain updates to the orthogonal complement of dominant singular directions, OPLoRA preserves essential pre-trained knowledge. The method is theoretically grounded and proven to exactly retain the top singular triples. A metric, $\rho_k$, is proposed to measure update alignment with dominant directions, providing a quantitative assessment of subspace interference. Experimental results on various tasks show that OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive task-specific performance. This establishes orthogonal projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

arXiv:2510.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R = I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL) grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages 5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity, comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA), and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer, and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances continual learning evaluations for language models.

Summary:
The study explores the impact of preference variance (PVar) on the effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in training large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. The research establishes that the gradient norm in DPO is influenced by the PVar of prompts, indicating that prompts with higher PVar lead to more significant updates. Experimental findings confirm that prompts with higher PVar outperform those with lower PVar or random selection. The study demonstrates the robustness of a PVar-based selection method even with smaller reward models. Additionally, training on only the top 10% of prompts with the highest PVar, derived from the UltraFeedback dataset, results in better evaluation performance than using the full dataset.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

<div> Mixture-of-Experts, Scaling, Model capacity, Expert diversity, GatePro <br />
Summary: 
GatePro is a new parameter-free method introduced to address the challenge faced by large language models using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures where redundant computation limits model capacity due to simultaneous selection of functionally similar experts. GatePro enhances expert selection diversity by introducing localized competition mechanisms to prevent redundant expert co-activation while maintaining expert specialization. The method improves expert diversity, making experts develop distinct and complementary capabilities, thus avoiding functional redundancy. GatePro is effective across different model scales and benchmarks and can be easily implemented during any training phase without additional learnable parameters. <div>

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE effectiveness.

Summary: This study addresses the challenge of quantifying uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) by establishing a link between model uncertainty and invariance under semantic-preserving interventions from a causal viewpoint. The researchers introduce a novel grey-box uncertainty quantification method that evaluates the variation in model outputs before and after such interventions, effectively estimating epistemic uncertainty. The method is validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on various LLMs and question-answering datasets, demonstrating superior effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the classification and summarization of clinical text for eligibility in clinical trials. The system combines various feature extraction methods including word embeddings, named entity recognition, and vectorization techniques to identify relevant medical concepts and categorize documents based on eligibility criteria. Evaluation using ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods in automating clinical trial eligibility assessment.

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec) and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Summary:
The study examines the impact of example representativeness and output diversity on the performance of large language model (LLM) ensembles. Two one-shot strategies are compared: centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples (baseline), with varying sampling temperatures. The proposed approach, with a higher temperature setting, outperforms random selection by +7.6% (macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Additionally, the proposed model surpasses 5-shot prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). The findings emphasize the significance of combining representative example selection with increased temperature for achieving the appropriate diversity in LLM ensembles. This research underscores the practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in optimizing one-shot LLM ensembles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared: centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples (baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6% (macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

Summary: 
- MENAValues is a new benchmark designed to assess the cultural alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) in regards to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
- The dataset used in MENAValues is based on authoritative human surveys from 16 countries in the MENA region, capturing the sociocultural landscape.
- The evaluation of LLMs in MENAValues reveals three critical phenomena: Cross-Lingual Value Shifts, Reasoning-Induced Degradation, and Logit Leakage.
- Models operating in native languages tend to oversimplify the diverse nations in the MENA region.
- MENAValues provides a framework for identifying and addressing cultural misalignment in AI models, offering both insights and tools for creating more culturally inclusive AI systems.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings (neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language, "Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

<div> acceleration, LLM inference, speculative decoding, latency, heterogeneous accelerators <br />
<br />
Summary: Mirror Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD) is a new inference algorithm that aims to improve the efficiency of LLM inference by breaking the latency-acceptance tradeoff. It does so by launching branch-complete rollouts in parallel with the target model's suffix, utilizing both GPU and NPU accelerators for cross-device parallelism. The algorithm speculates forward continuations for the target model to verify while simultaneously speculating correction paths for the draft model, creating two complementary execution pipelines. To further reduce draft latency without compromising acceptance semantics, Mirror-SD introduces speculative streaming, enabling the draft to emit multiple tokens per step. These strategies result in consistent end-to-end speedups of 2.8x-5.8x across various tasks, outperforming existing methods such as EAGLE3 by an average of 30%. Mirror-SD represents a significant advancement in speculative decoding for large-scale models, showcasing the potential for high acceptance rates with low overhead. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation: increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods (Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics, we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to 66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving 2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach to graph-based abstract code generation using large language models (LLMs). While LLMs typically excel at generating sequential code, this work focuses on encapsulating logic in predefined nodes and determining execution flow through edges, relevant for visual programming languages. By proposing JSON representations for graphs, the study demonstrates that LLMs can successfully generate abstract code in a single pass. The evaluation on a custom Python re-implementation of Scratch, called ScratchTest, showcases the importance of accurate graph representations in achieving high accuracy. The findings emphasize the impact of different representations on the performance of LLMs, highlighting the need for suitable representations in graph-based code generation tasks. Overall, this work marks a significant advancement in representation learning for graph-based abstract code generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges. This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph representations. We also show that different representations induce significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code generation.

Summary:<br /> 
The article introduces CoT-Evo, an evolutionary chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation framework designed for scientific reasoning tasks. Traditional CoT distillation struggles in scientific domains due to the complexity and specialized knowledge requirements. To address this, CoT-Evo constructs diverse reasoning trajectories from multiple large language models (LLMs) enriched with domain knowledge and refines them through novelty-driven selection, recombination, and mutation. A fitness function evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and knowledge utilization, resulting in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for scientific reasoning. This dataset is used to fine-tune a compact model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks. The approach synthesizes high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse LLMs, providing a scalable solution for improving the performance of smaller student models in scientific domains. <br /> <div>

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models. To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

Chain of Thought (CoT) fine-tuning is a method to enhance large language models (LLMs) with human-like reasoning skills by training them on curated reasoning traces. The technique combines supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to develop abilities such as detailed planning, divergent thinking, intuitive judgment, and fact perception in LLMs. This survey, grounded in human reasoning theory, classifies CoT fine-tuning methods using the Six Thinking Hats framework to understand the various thinking modes involved.

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking, intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception, etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory. Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens. Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster progress in this rapidly evolving field.

Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) is a challenge, with existing methods based on external constraints that impact generation fluency. A new method, Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding (DSCD), is proposed. DSCD enhances safety by strengthening the inner next-token distribution while weakening hallucination and toxic layers in output generation. This approach does not require parameter fine-tuning and provides lightweight, compatible, and plug-and-play capabilities. It integrates seamlessly with existing detoxification methods for improved performance. Experimental results show that DSCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detoxification and fluency, surpassing existing methods in efficiency. The findings suggest that DSCD has the potential to be a practical and scalable solution for safer deployment of LLMs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding (DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning. DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

Summary: 
The article introduces SHIELD, a lightweight preprocessing framework designed to enhance the safety of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). By incorporating fine-grained safety classification and category-specific guidance, SHIELD can effectively combat adversarial inputs that may conceal harmful intentions within benign prompts. Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD employs tailored safety prompts that enable nuanced refusals or safe redirection without the need for retraining. Through experiments on five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently reduces jailbreak and non-following rates while maintaining utility. The method is easy to implement, adds minimal overhead, and can be easily adapted to address new attack types. SHIELD serves as a practical safety solution for both weakly and strongly aligned LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight, model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block, Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining. Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and strongly aligned LVLMs.

Summary:
The study explores the impact of context format on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance in large language models. While previous research has focused on retrieval quality and prompting strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed has been overlooked. The study shows that subtle choices in context representation, such as delimiters and structural markers, can have significant effects on accuracy and stability. By conducting controlled experiments varying context density, delimiter styles, and positional placement, the researchers identify factors that influence performance differences. They introduce a strategy called Contextual Normalization, which standardizes context representations before generation to improve robustness to order variation and enhance long-context utilization. Experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG benchmarks demonstrate that this approach consistently improves RAG performance. These findings emphasize the importance of not only retrieving the right content but also presenting it effectively for better long-context reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e., context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization, a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for better long-context reasoning.

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low memory cost.

<br />
Summary:
The article discusses the issue of bias in AI systems, particularly those reliant on natural language data, and the ethical and practical concerns it raises. Traditional fairness methods have limitations in addressing bias as they depend on protected-attribute labels and may not generalize across datasets, leading to accuracy-fairness trade-offs. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which leverages large language models to generate counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while maintaining label integrity. The effectiveness of LGSA was evaluated on a dataset of short English sentences with gender biases, professions, and binary classification labels. Results demonstrate that LGSA reduces performance disparities without compromising accuracy, achieving a significant improvement in balancing gender biases while maintaining high task accuracy and label fidelity. <div>

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods, such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels. Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification, toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a 7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7 percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task accuracy and label fidelity.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe, syntactic structures, Multilayer Perceptron neurons, cognitive neuroscience <br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP) to investigate the neural components of Large Language Models (LLMs) and cortical regions involved in processing syntactic structures. Different LLMs (GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama 2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4) show similar processing of syntax at specific layers, while the human brain uses distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels. Representational similarity analysis reveals stronger alignment between LLM representations and the left hemisphere of the brain. Upgraded models like Gemma 2 and Llama 3.1 display varying degrees of similarity to the brain compared to their predecessors. The findings raise questions about whether LLM advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like mechanisms. The HFTP tool proves to be valuable in bridging computational linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain. To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama 2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels. Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational linguistics and cognitive neuroscience.

<div> word-guessing board game, abductive reasoning, large language models, natural language data, benchmark

Summary:
Concept, a word-guessing board game, is introduced as a benchmark to evaluate the abductive reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While humans excel at the game with a success rate over 90%, LLMs struggle with tasks requiring abstract reasoning. The game challenges LLMs in interpreting strategic intents of other players and adjusting initial hypotheses based on sequential information updates. Performance of LLMs is notably lower in lower-resource languages such as Dutch, French, and Spanish compared to English. This highlights the limitations of LLMs in handling tasks that involve abstract reasoning and strategic thinking, emphasizing the need for further research and development in enhancing their capabilities in understanding and processing complex linguistic information. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper, we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically, we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch, French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Evaluation of a prototypical agent, Search-R1, highlights the need for improvement in reasoning faithfulness.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a novel method called In-Distribution Steering (IDS) for controlling large language models by adapting the steering strength based on the input data distribution in representation space. Unlike existing methods with fixed steering strength, IDS dynamically adjusts interventions to ensure adaptive intervention and generation stability during text generation. Experimental results show that IDS excels in accuracy on classification tasks while maintaining coherent text generation without collapse. This adaptability makes IDS well-suited for real-world applications where precise control over language models is crucial. <div>

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1) Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers, hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently, WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user needs and advancing personalized service.

<div> Text-to-Speech, emotion, Classifier-Free Guidance, adaptive scheme, semantic content<br /><br />Summary:<br />Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems aim to achieve fine-grained emotional expression through natural language prompts, but face challenges when the emotion prompted conflicts with the text's semantic content, resulting in unnatural speech. The use of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) improves prompt alignment but its integration into auto-regressive (AR) TTS models has been limited, affecting audio quality. This paper tackles the style-content mismatch in AR TTS by introducing an adaptive CFG approach that adjusts based on the level of detected mismatch using large language models or natural language inference models. The research focuses on analyzing the effects of CFG on the emotional expressiveness of AR TTS models. The findings reveal that the adaptive CFG approach enhances emotional expressiveness without compromising audio quality or intelligibility, making it a promising solution for addressing mismatches in AR TTS systems. <div>

Abstract: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech, undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and intelligibility.

Summary:

Computational stylometry is a valuable tool for analyzing writing style, with applications ranging from forensic tasks to literary attribution. Traditional supervised and contrastive approaches often struggle with spurious correlations and confusion between style and topic. This article proposes a new unsupervised approach that leverages the pre-training and in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) for authorship verification. By using log-probabilities to measure style transferability between texts, the method outperforms LLM prompting approaches and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines while controlling for topical correlations. The approach shows consistent performance scaling with base model size and offers flexibility in computational cost versus accuracy trade-offs through a test-time computation mechanism. Overall, this novel approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in computational stylometry for authorship verification tasks.

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation, and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static `rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1 demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones, outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues, and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward. Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior than static CQA pipelines.

Summary: 
The study introduces Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight framework designed to improve the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in handling challenges related to cross-passage inference. EBCAR operates directly on retrieved passage embeddings, leveraging structural information and a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance cross-passage understanding. The framework outperforms state-of-the-art rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, showcasing its effectiveness in information retrieval tasks that require inference across passages. EBCAR excels in accuracy and efficiency, addressing issues such as coreference resolution, entity disambiguation, and evidence aggregation across multiple sources. This approach fills a critical gap in existing methods, providing a promising solution for optimizing retrieval performance in RAG systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

<div> Keywords: large language models, cache eviction, scoring-aggregation, defensive aggregation, worst-case risk management

Summary:
Large language models have transformed natural language processing, but the high memory and runtime costs of the transformer's Key-Value cache pose deployment challenges. Current methods use scoring-aggregation to remove unnecessary cache entries, assuming stable importance. However, this assumption is precarious, making mean aggregation vulnerable to extreme cases. To address this, a new defensive aggregation strategy, consisting of a two-step linear-time approach that controls worst-case risk with minimal computational overhead, has been proposed. The DefensiveKV and Layer-DefensiveKV methods, incorporating layer-wise budget allocation, outperform existing techniques in reducing generation quality loss. Across various task domains and datasets, these methods demonstrate significant improvements under a 20% cache size constraint. This work not only sets new performance benchmarks but also offers a promising avenue for optimizing cache eviction by managing worst-case risk. <div>
arXiv:2510.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries, based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work, we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV, which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18 datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk management.

Proverbs are a global linguistic phenomenon that often remains unexplored due to cultural and linguistic boundaries. This study focuses on Greek proverbs and utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze their sentiment. By expanding the annotated dataset to include local dialects, the researchers create a map of Greece showing the distribution of sentiment in proverbs. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), the study demonstrates the effectiveness of sentiment classification for proverbs. The analysis reveals that negative sentiment is more prevalent in most regions of Greece. This non-conventional approach to sentiment polarity task provides an accurate depiction of the sentiment present in Greek proverbs. The combinatory analysis considers geographical position, dialect, and topic of the proverbs, shedding light on the cultural nuances and diversity within the Greek proverbs landscape.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment. Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs, (2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment, (3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece negative sentiment is more prevalent.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling, and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection. Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard, LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender, age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards improved security.

<title>D-SMART: Enhancing LLM Dialogue Consistency via Dynamic Structured Memory And Reasoning Tree</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13363</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic, structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

Abstract: Document AI (DAI) has emerged as a vital application area, and is significantly transformed by the advent of large language models (LLMs). While earlier approaches relied on encoder-decoder architectures, decoder-only LLMs have revolutionized DAI, bringing remarkable advancements in understanding and generation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of DAI's evolution, highlighting current research attempts and future prospects of LLMs in this field. We explore key advancements and challenges in multimodal, multilingual, and retrieval-augmented DAI, while also suggesting future research directions, including agent-based approaches and document-specific foundation models. This paper aims to provide a structured analysis of the state-of-the-art in DAI and its implications for both academic and practical applications.

<title>Make an Offer They Can't Refuse: Grounding Bayesian Persuasion in Real-World Dialogues without Pre-Commitment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13387</link>

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs. Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language (FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP) baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP performance comparable to that of larger models.

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4 can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation: GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution, suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning. Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions. These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation frameworks.

<title>Investigating Lexical Change through Cross-Linguistic Colexification Patterns</title>

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic comparative models to dictionary data from three language families, Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also find considerable differences between the language families under study, suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

Abstract: This survey provides the first systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks, analyzing 40+ evaluation benchmarks across NLP tasks, knowledge domains, cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities. We propose a taxonomy organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps: limited temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches: native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into benchmark methodologies, reproducibility standards, and evaluation metrics while offering recommendations for future development.

<title>Beyond Single-Reward: Multi-Pair, Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization for Machine Translation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13434</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT), but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair, Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against leading proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However, the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain, is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works. Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

<title>ConsintBench: Evaluating Language Models on Real-World Consumer Intent Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13499</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex, uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mylittleriver/MedREK.

<title>Attention Illuminates LLM Reasoning: The Preplan-and-Anchor Rhythm Enables Fine-Grained Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment, and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

In this paper, we (Tu_Character_lab) report our participation in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025 Round 2, which eval- uates agents across three tracks: task-oriented dialogue, context-aware dialogue, and their integration. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: (i) lightweight prompting techniques in the API track, including a Deflanderization prompting method to suppress excessive role-play and improve task fidelity, and (ii) fine-tuned large models in the GPU track, leveraging Qwen3-14B with supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA). Our best submissions ranked 2nd on Task 1, 2nd on Task 3 (API track), and 4th on Task 3 (GPU track).

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model (LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more challenging.

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities, but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However, existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time, enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse. Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/ICDOPS-QA-2024.

<title>Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\% in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37 decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework https://github.com/BaggerOfWords/Sampling-and-Detection

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs. Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data, NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

<title>GAPS: A Clinically Grounded, Automated Benchmark for Evaluating AI Clinicians</title>

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding (cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness), \textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood, creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth (G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity, and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in high-stakes information environments.

<title>Confidence-Based Response Abstinence: Improving LLM Trustworthiness via Activation-Based Uncertainty Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13750</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13750</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable, architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

<title>The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

<title>Breadcrumbs Reasoning: Memory-Efficient Reasoning with Compression Beacons</title>

arXiv:2510.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck, especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts (fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large, and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x, while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

Abstract: Writing competitive programming problems is exacting. Authors must: set constraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts; target specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data structures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We argue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model capabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce AutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade problem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites approach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than 81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create novel variants with reference and brute-force solutions. By cross-verifying these generated solutions against test cases, we can further filter out malformed problems. Our system ensures high correctness, as verified by human experts. AutoCode successfully produces novel problems judged by Grandmaster-level (top 0.3%) competitive programmers to be of contest quality.

<title>From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue, SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks, classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT. Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning. This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning, paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

Abstract: Critical thinking represents a fundamental competency in today's education landscape. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in the learning analytics community on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring core "subskills" that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where students operationalize critical thinking: student-written argumentative essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language models (GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and ModernBERT). GPT-5 with few-shot prompting achieved the strongest results and demonstrated particular strength on subskills with separable, frequent categories, while lower performance was observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions or rare categories. Our results underscore critical trade-offs in automated critical thinking assessment: proprietary models offer superior reliability at higher cost, while open-source alternatives provide practical accuracy with reduced sensitivity to minority categories. Our work represents an initial step toward scalable assessment of higher-order reasoning skills across authentic educational contexts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer actively aligns vision and language representation features during training, enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements, producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage. As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL), planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens, revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31% increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, critical concerns about their trustworthiness persist, particularly in safety and robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce TRUSTVIS, an automated evaluation framework that provides a comprehensive assessment of LLM trustworthiness. A key feature of our framework is its interactive user interface, designed to offer intuitive visualizations of trustworthiness metrics. By integrating well-known perturbation methods like AutoDAN and employing majority voting across various evaluation methods, TRUSTVIS not only provides reliable results but also makes complex evaluation processes accessible to users. Preliminary case studies on models like Vicuna-7b, Llama2-7b, and GPT-3.5 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in identifying safety and robustness vulnerabilities, while the interactive interface allows users to explore results in detail, empowering targeted model improvements.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.

Abstract: A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in transportation decision-making.

Abstract: Despite continuous advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerical reasoning remains a challenging area. Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context examples. Our model FINDER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both the FinQA and ConvFinQA datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks with execution accuracy improvements of 5.98% and 4.05%, respectively.

Abstract: Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection, memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines. On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance, outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win any.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain, while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8 distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of these models.

<title>Two Heads Are Better Than One: Audio-Visual Speech Error Correction with Dual Hypotheses</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm for generative error correction (GER) framework in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) that reasons over modality-specific evidences directly in the language space. Our framework, DualHyp, empowers a large language model (LLM) to compose independent N-best hypotheses from separate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and visual speech recognition (VSR) models. To maximize the effectiveness of DualHyp, we further introduce RelPrompt, a noise-aware guidance mechanism that provides modality-grounded prompts to the LLM. RelPrompt offers the temporal reliability of each modality stream, guiding the model to dynamically switch its focus between ASR and VSR hypotheses for an accurate correction. Under various corruption scenarios, our framework attains up to 57.7% error rate gain on the LRS2 benchmark over standard ASR baseline, contrary to single-stream GER approaches that achieve only 10% gain. To facilitate research within our DualHyp framework, we release the code and the dataset comprising ASR and VSR hypotheses at https://github.com/sungnyun/dualhyp.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models indicate a clear trend towards comprehensive content generation. However, the auditory domain remains a significant challenge, with music and speech often developed in isolation, hindering progress towards universal audio synthesis. This separation stems from inherent task conflicts and severe data imbalances, which impede the development of a truly unified audio generation model. To address this challenge, we propose UniMoE-Audio, a unified speech and music generation model within a novel Dynamic-Capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. Architecturally, UniMoE-Audio introduces a Top-P routing strategy for dynamic expert number allocation, and a hybrid expert design comprising routed experts for domain-specific knowledge, shared experts for domain-agnostic features, and null experts for adaptive computation skipping. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a three-stage training curriculum: 1) Independent Specialist Training leverages original datasets to instill domain-specific knowledge into each "proto-expert" without interference; 2) MoE Integration and Warmup incorporates these specialists into the UniMoE-Audio architecture, warming up the gate module and shared expert using a subset of balanced dataset; and 3) Synergistic Joint Training trains the entire model end-to-end on the fully balanced dataset, fostering enhanced cross-domain synergy. Extensive experiments show that UniMoE-Audio not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on major speech and music generation benchmarks, but also demonstrates superior synergistic learning, mitigating the performance degradation typically seen in naive joint training. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of specialized MoE architecture and curated training strategies in advancing the field of universal audio generation.

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce. Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of on-device settings.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging, open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor. Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3). Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios. Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raises the question of how they compare to human performance. While existing datasets often feature synthetic or overly simplistic tasks, some models have already surpassed human expert baselines. In this paper, we present MULTI, a Chinese multimodal dataset derived from authentic examination questions. Comprising over 18,000 carefully selected and refined questions, MULTI evaluates models using real-world examination standards, encompassing image-text comprehension, complex reasoning, and knowledge recall. Additionally, We also introduce MULTI-Elite, a 500-question selected hard subset, and MULTI-Extend with more than 4,500 external knowledge context pieces for testing in-context learning capabilities. Our evaluation highlights substantial room for MLLM advancement, with Qwen2-VL-72B achieving a 76.9% accuracy on MULTI and 53.1% on MULTI-Elite leading 25 evaluated models, compared to human expert baselines of 86.1% and 73.1%. MULTI serves not only as a robust evaluation platform but also paves the way for the development of expert-level AI.

Abstract: When exposed to human-generated data, language models are known to learn and amplify societal biases. While previous works introduced benchmarks that can be used to assess the bias in these models, they rely on assumptions that may not be universally true. For instance, a gender bias dimension commonly used by these metrics is that of family--career, but this may not be the only common bias in certain regions of the world. In this paper, we identify topical differences in gender bias across different regions and propose a region-aware bottom-up approach for bias assessment. Our proposed approach uses gender-aligned topics for a given region and identifies gender bias dimensions in the form of topic pairs that are likely to capture gender societal biases. Several of our proposed bias topic pairs are on par with human perception of gender biases in these regions in comparison to the existing ones, and we also identify new pairs that are more aligned than the existing ones. In addition, we use our region-aware bias topic pairs in a Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)-based evaluation metric to test for gender biases across different regions in different data domains. We also find that LLMs have a higher alignment to bias pairs for highly-represented regions showing the importance of region-aware bias evaluation metric.

Abstract: Current social bias benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily rely on predefined question formats like multiple-choice, limiting their ability to reflect the complexity and open-ended nature of real-world interactions. To close this gap, we extend an existing dataset BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) to Open-BBQ, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the social bias of LLMs in open-ended settings by incorporating two additional question categories: fill-in-the-blank and short-answer. Since our new Open-BBQ dataset contains a lot of open-ended responses like sentences and paragraphs, we developed an evaluation process to detect biases from open-ended content by labeling sentences and paragraphs. In addition to this, we also found that existing debiasing methods, such as self-debiasing (Gallegos et al., 2024), have over-correction issues, which make the original correct answers incorrect. In order to solve this issue, we propose Composite Prompting, an In-context Learning (ICL) method combining structured examples with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning to form a unified instruction template for LLMs to explicitly identify content that needs debiasing. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the bias for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied, but can inadvertently encode sensitive or harmful information, raising significant safety concerns. Machine unlearning has emerged to alleviate this concern; however, existing training-time unlearning approaches, relying on coarse-grained loss combinations, have limitations in precisely separating knowledge and balancing removal effectiveness with model utility. In contrast, we propose Fine-grained Activation manipuLation by Contrastive Orthogonal uNalignment (FALCON), a novel representation-guided unlearning approach that leverages information-theoretic guidance for efficient parameter selection, employs contrastive mechanisms to enhance representation separation, and projects conflict gradients onto orthogonal subspaces to resolve conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FALCON achieves superior unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility, exhibiting robust resistance against knowledge recovery attempts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and reasoning. Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized domains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained attention. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction-driven edits, particularly when structural accuracy and strict adherence to domain conventions are required. To address these challenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an automated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning diverse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text modifications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approximately 10\% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30\% over Llama-3.2-3B, and exceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40\% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, we release FineEdit at https://github.com/StuRinDQB/FineEdit} and https://huggingface.co/datasets/YimingZeng/FineEdit_bench.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs), which integrate external knowledge, have shown remarkable performance in medical domains, including clinical diagnosis. However, existing RAG methods often struggle to tailor retrieval strategies to diagnostic difficulty and input sample informativeness. This limitation leads to excessive and often unnecessary retrieval, impairing computational efficiency and increasing the risk of introducing noise that can degrade diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose ICA-RAG (\textbf{I}nformation \textbf{C}ompleteness Guided \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}eneration), a novel framework for enhancing RAG reliability in disease diagnosis. ICA-RAG utilizes an adaptive control module to assess the necessity of retrieval based on the input's information completeness. By optimizing retrieval and incorporating knowledge filtering, ICA-RAG better aligns retrieval operations with clinical requirements. Experiments on three Chinese electronic medical record datasets demonstrate that ICA-RAG significantly outperforms baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness in clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: Test-time scaling enhances large language model performance by allocating additional compute resources during inference. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling serves as a common sampling-based scaling technique, broadening the search space in parallel to find better solutions from the model distribution. However, its cost-performance trade-off is still underexplored. Two main challenges limit the efficiency of BoN sampling: (1) Generating N full samples consumes substantial GPU memory, reducing inference capacity under limited resources. (2) Reward models add extra memory and latency overhead, and training strong reward models introduces potential training data costs. Although some studies have explored efficiency improvements, none have addressed both challenges at once. To address this gap, we propose Self-Truncation Best-of-N (ST-BoN), a decoding method that avoids fully generating all N samples and eliminates the need for reward models. It leverages early sampling consistency in the model's internal states to identify the most promising path and truncate suboptimal ones. In terms of cost, ST-BoN reduces dynamic GPU memory usage by over 80% and inference latency by 50%. In terms of cost-performance trade-off, ST-BoN achieves the same performance as Full-BoN while saving computational cost by 70%-80%, and under the same cost, it can improve accuracy by 3-4 points.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong performance in multilingual question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging relevant passages retrieved from corpora. In multilingual RAG (mRAG), the retrieved passages can be written in languages other than that of the query entered by the user, making it challenging for LLMs to effectively utilize the provided information. Recent research suggests that retrieving passages from multilingual corpora can improve RAG performance, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the extent to which LLMs can leverage different kinds of multilingual contexts to generate accurate answers, *independently from retrieval quality*, remains understudied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive assessment of LLMs' ability to (i) make consistent use of a relevant passage regardless of its language, (ii) respond in the expected language, and (iii) focus on the relevant passage even when multiple `distracting' passages in different languages are provided in the context. Our experiments with four LLMs across three QA datasets covering a total of 48 languages reveal a surprising ability of LLMs to extract the relevant information from passages in a different language than the query, but a much weaker ability to formulate a full answer in the correct language. Our analysis, based on both accuracy and feature attribution techniques, further shows that distracting passages negatively impact answer quality regardless of their language. However, distractors in the query language exert a slightly stronger influence. Taken together, our findings deepen the understanding of how LLMs utilize context in mRAG systems, providing directions for future improvements.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HGPrompt, validating its effectiveness in learning an optimal ensemble for effective multi-source prompt transfer.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller, domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance. Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models. FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance, these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore, applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

<title>Teaching Models to Understand (but not Generate) High-risk Data</title>

Abstract: Language model developers typically filter out high-risk content -- such as toxic or copyrighted text -- from their pre-training data to prevent models from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits models' ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the model's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content. Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models' understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content) without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall, our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would otherwise be filtered out.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce S-MedQA, an English medical question-answering (QA) dataset for benchmarking large language models (LLMs) in fine-grained clinical specialties. S-MedQA has over 20k examples, covers 15 medical specialties, and QA pairs can have multiple specialty annotations (e.g., when a question is cross-disciplinary), constructed with both machine and expert verification to maximize data availability. We use S-MedQA to investigate the role of clinical specialty data in the knowledge-intensive scenario of medical QA. Our results show that 1) training on data from a clinical specialty does not necessarily lead to best performance on that specialty, and 2) regardless of the specialty the LLM was fine-tuned on, token probabilities of clinically relevant terms increase consistently across all specialties. Thus, we hypothesize improvement gains are derived mostly from domain shifting (e.g., general to medical) rather than specialty-specific knowledge injection, and suggest rethinking the role of fine-tuning data in the medical domain.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) leverage transparent reasoning traces, known as Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), to break down complex problems into intermediate steps and derive final answers. However, these reasoning traces introduce unique safety challenges: harmful content can be embedded in intermediate steps even when final answers appear benign. Existing moderation tools, designed to handle generated answers, struggle to effectively detect hidden risks within CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce ReasoningShield, a lightweight yet robust framework for moderating CoTs in LRMs. Our key contributions include: (1) formalizing the task of CoT moderation with a multi-level taxonomy of 10 risk categories across 3 safety levels, (2) creating the first CoT moderation benchmark which contains 9.2K pairs of queries and reasoning traces, including a 7K-sample training set annotated via a human-AI framework and a rigorously curated 2.2K human-annotated test set, and (3) developing a two-stage training strategy that combines stepwise risk analysis and contrastive learning to enhance robustness. Experiments show that ReasoningShield achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming task-specific tools like LlamaGuard-4 by 35.6% and general-purpose commercial models like GPT-4o by 15.8% on benchmarks, while also generalizing effectively across diverse reasoning paradigms, tasks, and unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable emergent abilities but remain poorly understood at a mechanistic level. This paper introduces the Multi-Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a theoretical framework that models LLMs as Hierarchical Variational Information Bottleneck (H-VIB) systems. MSPGT posits that standard language modeling objectives implicitly optimize multi-scale information compression, leading to the spontaneous formation of three internal processing scales-Global, Intermediate, and Local. We formalize this principle, derive falsifiable predictions about boundary positions and architectural dependencies, and validate them through cross-model experiments combining multi-signal fusion and causal interventions. Results across Llama and Qwen families reveal consistent multi-scale organization but strong architecture-specific variations, partially supporting and refining the theory. MSPGT thus advances interpretability from descriptive observation toward predictive, information-theoretic understanding of how hierarchical structure emerges within large neural language models.

Abstract: While black-box large language models are widely deployed, they produce generic outputs that overlook individual user preferences. Current personalization methods are fundamentally limited to response-level personalization; they only match final outputs, failing to model the underlying reasoning that connects user behavior to responses. To address this, this work introduces reasoning-level personalization as a new paradigm and proposes RPM, the first systematic framework designed to guide the model's reasoning process using structured rationales constructed from patterns in a user's behavior. RPM constructs a structured model of user behavior-built from response-influential features and statistical factors-to create personalized reasoning paths and retrieve beneficial examples for guiding inference through a feature-based retrieval mechanism. Extensive experiments across four diverse tasks demonstrate that RPM consistently outperforms existing response-level methods while simultaneously enhancing both personalization performance and interpretability, providing a promising direction for black-box LLM personalization.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration, and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated, still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe concerning high ASRs in realistic end-to-end settings, with the strongest-to-date Claude 4.5 Sonnet | CUA exhibiting the highest ASR of 60%, indicating that CUA threats can already result in tangible risks to users and computer systems. Overall, RedTeamCUA provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

Abstract: We analyze the syntactic sensitivity of Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems using methods inspired by psycholinguistic research. Specifically, we focus on the generation of intonational phrase boundaries, which can often be predicted by identifying syntactic boundaries within a sentence. We find that TTS systems struggle to accurately generate intonational phrase boundaries in sentences where syntactic boundaries are ambiguous (e.g., garden path sentences or sentences with attachment ambiguity). In these cases, systems need superficial cues such as commas to place boundaries at the correct positions. In contrast, for sentences with simpler syntactic structures, we find that systems do incorporate syntactic cues beyond surface markers. Finally, we finetune models on sentences without commas at the syntactic boundary positions, encouraging them to focus on more subtle linguistic cues. Our findings indicate that this leads to more distinct intonation patterns that better reflect the underlying structure.

Abstract: The emergence of ChatGPT marked a transformative milestone for Artificial Intelligence (AI), showcasing the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like text. This wave of innovation has revolutionized how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements, the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs. Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities. The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that ALLMs present for the Arab world.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet, a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content: MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks the MMD between the output to inspect and counterparts generated with various temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is benchmarked on machine translation and summarization datasets, on which it exhibits competitive performance relative to natural competitors.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of communication technologies has led to an explosion of standards, rendering traditional expert-dependent consultation methods inefficient and slow. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{KG2QA}, a question answering (QA) framework for communication standards that integrates fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) via a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. We construct a high-quality dataset of 6,587 QA pairs from ITU-T recommendations and fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, achieving significant performance gains: BLEU-4 increases from 18.86 to 66.90, outperforming both the base model and Llama-3-8B-Instruct. A structured KG containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations is built using LLM-assisted triple extraction based on a custom ontology. In our KG-RAG pipeline, the fine-tuned LLMs first retrieves relevant knowledge from KG, enabling more accurate and factually grounded responses. Evaluated by DeepSeek-V3 as a judge, the KG-enhanced system improves performance across five dimensions, with an average score increase of 2.26\%, demonstrating superior factual accuracy and relevance. Integrated with Web platform and API, KG2QA delivers an efficient and interactive user experience. Our code and data have been open-sourced https://github.com/luozhongze/KG2QA.

Abstract: Across languages, numeral systems vary widely in how they construct and combine numbers. While humans consistently learn to navigate this diversity, large language models (LLMs) struggle with linguistic-mathematical puzzles involving cross-linguistic numeral systems, which humans can learn to solve successfully. We investigate why this task is difficult for LLMs through a series of experiments that untangle the linguistic and mathematical aspects of numbers in language. Our experiments establish that models cannot consistently solve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems are explicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\times$, etc., as in "twenty + three"). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters of numeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use their linguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicit compositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicit numeral structure. We conclude that the ability to flexibly infer compositional rules from implicit patterns in human-scale data remains an open challenge for current reasoning models.

<title>LLM Probability Concentration: How Alignment Shrinks the Generative Horizon</title>

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs) often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this consistency in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the *Branching Factor* (BF)--a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. Building on this insight, we find this consistency has surprising implications for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic (lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., ``Sure'') that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered away from diversity.

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs). However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity, and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen resource development across all three languages.

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that, while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to do so.

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of automated evaluation using LLMs, a paradigm known as "LLM-as-a-judge". However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. Previous studies mainly optimize based on shallow outputs, overlooking rich cross-layer representations. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and task-relevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a post-hoc, plug-and-play framework for improving the alignment of LLM-as-a-Judge point-wise evaluations with human scores by leveraging internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer score-token logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, while keeping the LLM backbone frozen and ensuring no impact on the inference process. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the generalization of LAGER.

Abstract: With the surge of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to produce customized output, style-personalized text generation--"write like me"--has become a rapidly growing area of interest. However, style personalization is highly specific, relative to every user, and depends strongly on the pragmatic context, which makes it uniquely challenging. Although prior research has introduced benchmarks and metrics for this area, they tend to be non-standardized and have known limitations (e.g., poor correlation with human subjects). LLMs have been found to not capture author-specific style well, it follows that the metrics themselves must be scrutinized carefully. In this work we critically examine the effectiveness of the most common metrics used in the field, such as BLEU, embeddings, and LLMs-as-judges. We evaluate these metrics using our proposed style discrimination benchmark, which spans eight diverse writing tasks across three evaluation settings: domain discrimination, authorship attribution, and LLM-generated personalized vs non-personalized discrimination. We find strong evidence that employing ensembles of diverse evaluation metrics consistently outperforms single-evaluator methods, and conclude by providing guidance on how to reliably assess style-personalized text generation.

<title>Quantization Meets dLLMs: A Systematic Study of Post-training Quantization for Diffusion LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/FelixMessi/QDLM.

Abstract: Evaluating instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hindi is challenging due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks, as direct translation of English datasets fails to capture crucial linguistic and cultural nuances. To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains, including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new research directions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly exhaust context budgets before reaching solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation, we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents across three benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of 4.5% over ReAct, with further gains of 8.2% following ReSum-GRPO training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing most open-source web agents.

<title>Can an Individual Manipulate the Collective Decisions of Multi-Agents?</title>

Abstract: Individual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities across various domains, such as healthcare and law. Recent studies also show that coordinated multi-agent systems exhibit enhanced decision-making and reasoning abilities through collaboration. However, due to the vulnerabilities of individual LLMs and the difficulty of accessing all agents in a multi-agent system, a key question arises: If attackers only know one agent, could they still generate adversarial samples capable of misleading the collective decision? To explore this question, we formulate it as a game with incomplete information, where attackers know only one target agent and lack knowledge of the other agents in the system. With this formulation, we propose M-Spoiler, a framework that simulates agent interactions within a multi-agent system to generate adversarial samples. These samples are then used to manipulate the target agent in the target system, misleading the system's collaborative decision-making process. More specifically, M-Spoiler introduces a stubborn agent that actively aids in optimizing adversarial samples by simulating potential stubborn responses from agents in the target system. This enhances the effectiveness of the generated adversarial samples in misleading the system. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our findings confirm the risks posed by the knowledge of an individual agent in multi-agent systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We also explore several defense mechanisms, showing that our proposed attack framework remains more potent than baselines, underscoring the need for further research into defensive strategies.

Abstract: Extracting individual sentences from a document as evidence or reasoning steps is commonly done in many NLP tasks. However, extracted sentences often lack context necessary to make them understood, e.g., coreference and background information. To this end, we propose a content selection and planning framework for zero-shot decontextualisation, which determines what content should be mentioned and in what order for a sentence to be understood out of context. Specifically, given a potentially ambiguous sentence and its context, we first segment it into basic semantically-independent units. We then identify potentially ambiguous units from the given sentence, and extract relevant units from the context based on their discourse relations. Finally, we generate a content plan to rewrite the sentence by enriching each ambiguous unit with its relevant units. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is competitive for sentence decontextualisation, producing sentences that exhibit better semantic integrity and discourse coherence, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability. With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/gxx27/time_unlearn.

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an efficient and powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, reasoning distillation may inadvertently cause benchmark contamination, where evaluation data included in distillation datasets can inflate performance metrics of distilled models. In this work, we formally define the task of distillation data detection, which is uniquely challenging due to the partial availability of distillation data. Then, we propose a novel and effective method Token Probability Deviation (TBD), which leverages the probability patterns of the generated output tokens. Our method is motivated by the analysis that distilled models tend to generate near-deterministic tokens for seen questions, while producing more low-probability tokens for unseen questions. Our key idea behind TBD is to quantify how far the generated tokens' probabilities deviate from a high reference probability. In effect, our method achieves competitive detection performance by producing lower scores for seen questions than for unseen questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an AUC of 0.918 and a TPR@1% FPR of 0.470 on the S1 dataset.

Abstract: Translating clauses into executable code is a vital stage of automated rule checking (ARC) and is essential for effective building design compliance checking, particularly for rules with implicit properties or complex logic requiring domain knowledge. Thus, by systematically analyzing building clauses, 66 atomic functions are defined first to encapsulate common computational logics. Then, LLM-FuncMapper is proposed, a large language model (LLM)-based approach with rule-based adaptive prompts that match clauses to atomic functions. Finally, executable code is generated by composing functions through the LLMs. Experiments show LLM-FuncMapper outperforms fine-tuning methods by 19% in function matching while significantly reducing manual annotation efforts. Case study demonstrates that LLM-FuncMapper can automatically compose multiple atomic functions to generate executable code, boosting rule-checking efficiency. To our knowledge, this research represents the first application of LLMs for interpreting complex design clauses into executable code, which may shed light on further adoption of LLMs in the construction domain.

Abstract: Research shows that errors in natural language can be corrected by translating texts to another language and back using language models. We explore to what extent this latent correction capability extends to Automated Program Repair (APR) by investigating Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translating code from one programming language into another programming or natural language and back, using Large Language Models (LLMs). We hypothesize that RTT restores patterns most commonly seen in the LLM's training corpora through regression toward the mean, replacing infrequent bugs with more frequent, natural, bug-free code. To test this hypothesis, we employ nine LLMs and four common APR benchmarks in Java, and perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of RTT-generated patches. We find that RTT through English generates plausible patches for 100 of 164 bugs with GPT-4 on the HumanEval-Java benchmark, and 97 are found to be correct in our manual assessment. Moreover, RTT uniquely generates plausible patches for 46 bugs that were missed by LLMs specifically fine-tuned for APR. While this demonstrates the viability of RTT for APR, we also observe limitations, such as a lower overall bug fix rate than the state-of-the-art and diluting the original coding style. We analyze the impact of these limitations and discuss the potential of using RTT as a complementary component in APR frameworks. A replication package is available for download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10500593.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) solely trained on next-token prediction learn to solve a wide range of problems involving mathematical reasoning. But how does this ability evolve during training? We show the first analysis of how mathematical reasoning abilities of several open-weight LLMs develop during pre-training and post-training. To this end, we construct MathCAMPS, a synthetic dataset of novel mathematical reasoning problems grounded in 44 fine-grained skills taken from the Common Core curriculum from K to 8th grades. In one experiment, we show that mathematical skills are learned during pre-training in an order that measurably correlates with the human-designed curriculum, even though training data are randomly ordered. We also show a detailed analysis of which mathematical abilities benefit from instruction tuning, a widely used post-training method and, in contrast, which skills suffer. Our work paves the way for an empirical understanding of LLM training dynamics in relation to reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work in machine learning community proposed multiple methods for performing lossy compression (quantization) of large matrices. This quantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main component of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed of loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and rate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be able to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product. Specifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is applied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per entry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate matrix product $A^\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower bound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate $R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries. Algorithmically, we construct a universal quantizer based on nested lattices with an explicit guarantee of approximation error for any (non-random) pair of matrices $A$, $B$ in terms of only Frobenius norms $\|\bar{A}\|_F, \|\bar{B}\|_F$ and $\|\bar{A}^\top \bar{B}\|_F$, where $\bar{A},\bar{B}$ are versions of $A,B$ with zero-centered columns, respectively. For iid Gaussian matrices our quantizer achieves the lower bound and is, thus, asymptotically optimal. A practical low-complexity version of our quantizer achieves performance quite close to optimal. In addition, we derive rate-distortion function for matrix multiplication of iid Gaussian matrices, which exhibits an interesting phase-transition at $R\approx 0.906$ bit/entry, showing necessity of Johnson-Lindestrauss dimensionality reduction (sketching) in the low-rate regime.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have generated both interest and concern about their potential adoption as information sources or communication tools across different domains. In public health, where stakes are high and impacts extend across diverse populations, adopting LLMs poses unique challenges that require thorough evaluation. However, structured approaches for assessing potential risks in public health remain under-explored. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups with public health professionals and individuals with lived experience to unpack their concerns, situated across three distinct and critical public health issues that demand high-quality information: infectious disease prevention (vaccines), chronic and well-being care (opioid use disorder), and community health and safety (intimate partner violence). We synthesize participants' perspectives into a risk taxonomy, identifying and contextualizing the potential harms LLMs may introduce when positioned alongside traditional health communication. This taxonomy highlights four dimensions of risk to individuals, human-centered care, information ecosystem, and technology accountability. For each dimension, we unpack specific risks and offer example reflection questions to help practitioners adopt a risk-reflexive approach. By summarizing distinctive LLM characteristics and linking them to identified risks, we discuss the need to revisit prior mental models of information behaviors and complement evaluations with external validity and domain expertise through lived experience and real-world practices. Together, this work contributes a shared vocabulary and reflection tool for people in both computing and public health to collaboratively anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate risks in deciding when to employ LLM capabilities (or not) and how to mitigate harm.

<title>On the Limits of Language Generation: Trade-Offs Between Hallucination and Mode Collapse</title>

Abstract: Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but certain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language, the trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be expressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise, outputting invalid strings constitutes "hallucination," and failing to capture the full range leads to "mode collapse." We ask if a language model can meet both requirements.
  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building on Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a distribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite collection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say the model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size increases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.
  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in language generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class of language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible for most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s result, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any countable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with breadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.
  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples needed for generation with or without breadth.
  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is achievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples (strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that post-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in reducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning adapts pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to follow human instructions for real-world applications. However, the rapid growth of these datasets introduces significant redundancy, leading to increased computational costs. Existing methods for selecting instruction data aim to prune this redundancy, but predominantly rely on computationally demanding techniques such as proxy-based inference or training-based metrics. Consequently, the substantial computational costs incurred by these selection processes often exacerbate the very efficiency bottlenecks they are intended to resolve, posing a significant challenge to the scalable and effective tuning of MLLMs. To address this challenge, we first identify a critical, yet previously overlooked, factor: the anisotropy inherent in visual feature distributions. We find that this anisotropy induces a \textit{Global Semantic Drift}, and overlooking this phenomenon is a key factor limiting the efficiency of current data selection methods. Motivated by this insight, we devise \textbf{PRISM}, the first training-free framework for efficient visual instruction selection. PRISM surgically removes the corrupting influence of global background features by modeling the intrinsic visual semantics via implicit re-centering. Empirically, PRISM reduces the end-to-end time for data selection and model tuning to just 30\% of conventional pipelines. More remarkably, it achieves this efficiency while simultaneously enhancing performance, surpassing models fine-tuned on the full dataset across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, culminating in a 101.7\% relative improvement over the baseline. The code is available for access via \href{https://github.com/bibisbar/PRISM}{this repository}.

Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) for grounded persuasive language generation in automated copywriting, with real estate marketing as a focal application. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted copywriting while ensuring factuality of content generation.

<title>Rec-R1: Bridging Generative Large Language Models and User-Centric Recommendation Systems via Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2503.24289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for complex reasoning, yet their capacity for emergent coordination in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) when operating under strict swarm-like constraints-limited local perception and communication-remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often do not fully capture the unique challenges of decentralized coordination when agents operate with incomplete spatio-temporal information. To bridge this gap, we introduce SwarmBench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the swarm intelligence capabilities of LLMs acting as decentralized agents. SwarmBench features five foundational MAS coordination tasks (Pursuit, Synchronization, Foraging, Flocking, Transport) within a configurable 2D grid environment, forcing agents to rely solely on local sensory input ($k\times k$ view) and local communication. We propose metrics for coordination effectiveness and analyze emergent group dynamics. Zero-shot evaluations of leading LLMs (e.g., deepseek-v3, o4-mini) reveal significant task-dependent performance variations. While some rudimentary coordination is observed, our results indicate that current LLMs significantly struggle with robust long-range planning and adaptive strategy formation under the uncertainty inherent in these decentralized scenarios. Assessing LLMs under such swarm-like constraints is crucial for understanding their utility in future decentralized intelligent systems. We release SwarmBench as an open, extensible toolkit-built on a customizable physical system-providing environments, prompts, evaluation scripts, and comprehensive datasets. This aims to foster reproducible research into LLM-based MAS coordination and the theoretical underpinnings of emergent collective behavior under severe informational decentralization. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/x66ccff/swarmbench.

Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. In this work, we propose R$^2$ec, a unified large recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capability. R$^2$ec introduces a dual-head architecture that supports both reasoning chain generation and efficient item prediction in a single model, significantly reducing inference latency. To overcome the lack of annotated reasoning data, we design RecPO, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes reasoning and recommendation jointly with a novel fused reward mechanism. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that R$^2$ec outperforms traditional, LLM-based, and reasoning-augmented recommender baselines, while further analyses validate its competitive efficiency among conventional LLM-based recommender baselines and strong adaptability to diverse recommendation scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues. However, multi-agent collaboration faces critical safety challenges, such as hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph, GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an incremental training paradigm learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.

Abstract: Integration of audio perception into large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research area for enabling machine listening applications, yet efficient transfer of rich audio semantics from audio encoders to LLMs remains underexplored. The most widely used integration paradigm projects the audio encoder output tokens into the LLM input space (e.g., via an MLP or a Q-Former), then prepends or inserts them to the text tokens. We refer to this generic scheme as Prepend to the LLM's input token space (PLITS) integration. We propose an efficient alternative, Lightweight Audio LLM Integration (LAL). LAL introduces audio representations solely via the attention mechanism within different layers of the LLM, bypassing its feedforward module. LAL encodes rich audio semantics at an appropriate level of abstraction for integration into different blocks of LLMs. Our design significantly reduces computational overhead compared to existing integration approaches. Observing with Whisper that the speech encoder benefits from PLITS integration, we propose an audio encoder aware approach for efficiently Probing Audio encoders via LLM (PAL), which employs PLITS integration for Whisper and LAL for general audio encoders. Under an identical training curriculum, LAL consistently maintains performance or outperforms existing integration approaches across multiple base LLMs and tasks. For general audio tasks, LAL improvement is up to 30% over a strong PLITS baseline while reducing memory usage by up to 64.1% and increasing throughput by up to 247.5%. Furthermore, for general audio-music-speech LLM, PAL performs on par with a fully PLITS integration-based system but with substantially improved computational and memory efficiency.

arXiv:2506.19847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in the Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations. In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography: passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given additional affordances like using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes, including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities. While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed monitors at present, this could change in the future.

<title>Cross-modal Associations in Vision and Language Models: Revisiting the Bouba-Kiki Effect</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.10013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like `bouba' with round shapes and `kiki' with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as a measure of model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel approach to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these model variants do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both model variants lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts arising from discrepancies between their pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts are especially problematic in real-world investment services, where a model's inherent biases can misalign with institutional objectives, leading to unreliable recommendations. Despite this risk, the intrinsic investment biases of LLMs remain underexplored. We propose an experimental framework to investigate emergent behaviors in such conflict scenarios, offering a quantitative analysis of bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent biases of models and measure their persistence. Our analysis, centered on sector, size, and momentum, reveals distinct, model-specific biases. Across most models, a tendency to prefer technology stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian strategies is observed. These foundational biases often escalate into confirmation bias, causing models to cling to initial judgments even when faced with increasing counter-evidence. A public leaderboard benchmarking bias across a broader set of models is available at https://linqalpha.com/leaderboard

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Abstract: Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

arXiv:2509.20712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work, we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds, covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover, our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices, such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

arXiv:2510.03567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.

<div> Large Reasoning Models, M-Thinker, Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment, Language Consistency, GRPO algorithm<br /><br />Summary:<br />This article addresses the limitations of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) when processing non-English languages, specifically the inconsistency in language between the input, thoughts, and answers, and the inferior reasoning and answer accuracy. A new model named M-Thinker is proposed, which employs the GRPO algorithm equipped with a Language Consistency (LC) reward ensuring adherence to language consistency and a Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) reward that aligns non-English reasoning paths with English ones enhancing the reasoning capabilities across languages. The model is iteratively refined through reinforcement learning to maintain high language consistency and improved performance. The M-Thinker models with 1.5B and 7B parameters have shown nearly perfect language consistency and high performance on multilingual benchmarks such as MMATH and PolyMath, as well as exhibiting excellent generalization abilities in out-of-domain languages. <div>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by adopting the "think-then-answer" paradigm, which enhances both accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.

<div> logic puzzles, large language models, phantom recall, reasoning, perturbations<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in solving logic puzzles, highlighting that their apparent reasoning ability may actually be based on memorized templates. When faced with slightly modified puzzles, LLMs exhibit a significant drop in performance, indicating a reliance on memorization rather than genuine reasoning. The research introduces the PHANTOM RECALL benchmark, comprising logic puzzles and perturbations designed to test reasoning structure comprehension. It identifies a recurring failure mode termed phantom recall, where LLMs provide incorrect solutions or rationales based on retained memory that no longer align with the altered scenario. To address this issue, the study introduces tools such as an automated logical-equivalence judge, a fine-grained reasoning error taxonomy, and a prompting-based mitigation framework. Despite high accuracy on unmodified puzzles, LLMs consistently underperform humans on perturbed puzzles, showcasing a gap between linguistic fluency and true logical understanding. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues? To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25 well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

<div> keywords: Large Language Models, world modeling, future state prediction, reward estimation, Retrieval-augmented World Model

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance agent decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and predicting action outcomes. However, their tendency toward hallucination and reliance on static training knowledge can lead to errors in long-horizon simulations. The study systematically investigates LLMs' capabilities in world modeling through tasks such as next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. While LLMs perform well in capturing immediate next states and identifying state transitions, their performance deteriorates in full-procedure planning, indicating limitations in modeling environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM) is proposed, which incorporates up-to-date knowledge retrieved from external sources. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in longer-horizon simulations with R-WoM compared to baselines. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs' tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge, which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

<div> knowledge representations, Large Language Models (LLMs), truthfulness, robustness, generalizability
<br />
The study investigates the fragility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of their internal knowledge representations. By testing the separability of true and false statements under various out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, the research shows that LLMs struggle to maintain robust knowledge when faced with superficially different inputs. Results suggest that while LLMs can distinguish between true and false statements that closely resemble their training data, this ability diminishes as statements become more OOD. The findings highlight a potential explanation for the brittleness of LLM performance on benchmarks, indicating that these models may learn shallow and non-robust knowledge representations. The study emphasizes the importance of improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations for enhancing the reliability and generalizability of LLMs.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

<div> Keywords: Large reasoning models, machine translation, intermediate tokens, fine-tuning, translation-specific prompting strategies 

Summary: 
Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown success in various problem-solving tasks but their impact on machine translation (MT) is not well understood. This study explores the use of intermediate tokens in MT across different language pairs and setups. The results show that the generation of "thinking tokens" does not significantly improve LRMs in MT tasks. Fine-tuning models with synthetic chain of thought (CoT) explanations for translation steps does not outperform standard fine-tuning. However, combining outputs of translation-specific prompting strategies for intermediate tokens leads to better performance. The findings suggest that using a teacher for target translation refinement or expanding parallel corpora is more effective than distilling CoT explanations into MT models. <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that "thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically, fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However, constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT explanations into "thinking" MT models.

Summary:
MIND is a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline designed to detect factual and cultural discrepancies in multilingual question answering knowledge bases. It aims to ensure consistency in objective queries across languages while considering cultural variations in subjective responses. By highlighting divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions, MIND helps improve the accuracy and cultural awareness of QA systems. The system was evaluated on a bilingual QA system in maternal and infant health and a dataset of bilingual questions annotated for inconsistencies was released. MIND demonstrated its reliability in identifying inconsistencies across different domains, supporting the development of culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?, while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are proficient in both informal and formal mathematical reasoning but struggle with autoformalisation, the task of translating informal mathematics into a formal format. To address this challenge, the TopoAlign framework leverages code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs by structurally aligning code data with formal statements. This approach significantly improves the performance of DeepSeek-Math by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10, showcasing the benefits of training on aligned code data. Additionally, the framework also enhances the performance of Herald by 0.12% and 1.09% on BEq@10 and typecheck@10, respectively. The results demonstrate that utilizing code repositories for training Math LLMs can be advantageous even for specialized models, without requiring additional human annotation. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4) mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements. Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10 and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code data is beneficial even for specialized models.

Summary:
The article introduces GRAVITY, a framework for generating synthetic preference data that captures users' interests, values, beliefs, and personality traits to improve personalization in large language models (LLMs). By integrating various frameworks and psychological models, GRAVITY creates profile-grounded synthetic data to guide personalized content generation. Evaluation on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users shows that GRAVITY outperforms other methods, particularly across different cultures. The results indicate that profile-grounded synthetic data can effectively capture user variation, reduce reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered content, offering a scalable approach for LLM personalization. User studies demonstrate that outputs from GRAVITY are preferred over 86% of the time, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests, values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural, and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions, Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits -- GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation. We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation, especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over 4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a pipeline for creating challenging and realistic unanswerable multi-hop queries for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing benchmarks for RAG systems often lack complexity and can be easily cheated through disconnected reasoning or simple factual recall. To address this limitation, the authors present a pipeline for generating uncheatable, realistic, unanswerable, and multi-hop queries (CRUMQs) that can be tailored to different domains and corpora. By applying the pipeline to two popular RAG datasets, the authors show that CRUMQs significantly increase the challenge for RAG systems, reducing cheatability scores by up to 81%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pipeline in enhancing benchmark difficulty and realism, providing a valuable tool for driving the development of more capable RAG systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this, existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable, and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs), adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive development of more capable RAG systems.

Summary:<br />
Decoder-only transformers in large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well, with early layers focusing on input context, middle layers on task-specific processing, and late layers on output token generation. Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD) hypothesis suggests that after processing by early and middle layers, hidden states may contain enough information for generating multiple tokens using only late layers, without repeated traversal. DMTD Qwen3-4B model, even trained on a limited dataset, has shown promising results with up to a 2x speedup and minor performance loss. It is expected to perform even better with larger datasets, as per scaling analysis. This method requires no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification. Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

Summary:
Context-Folding is introduced as a framework for large language model (LLM) agents to actively manage their working context by branching into sub-trajectories to handle subtasks. The FoldGRPO framework utilizes reinforcement learning with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. This approach allows the agent to collapse intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. On complex long-horizon tasks such as Deep Research and SWE, the folding agent matches or outperforms ReAct baselines using a smaller active context. It significantly outperforms models relying on summarization-based context management. Overall, the Context-Folding framework enhances the performance of LLM agents by allowing them to manage their context efficiently, leading to improved task performance on long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.

<div> autoformalisation, conjecturing, Large Language Models, ConjectureBench, Lean-FIRe<br /><br />Summary: Autoformalisation is traditionally viewed as translating informal mathematical statements into formal language, yet an important preliminary step, conjecturing, is often overlooked. This process involves forming a hypothesis or a conjecture, which is crucial before any formalization can occur. Existing evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1 generally overestimate their effectiveness in autoformalisation because they disregard this aspect. To address this, the newly created ConjectureBench dataset and a specialized evaluation framework have been introduced to measure the conjecturing capacity of LLMs separately from the autoformalisation process. The study’s findings indicate that while LLMs can generate accurate conjectures, treating conjecturing as a distinct and critical task significantly enhances the overall performance of autoformalisation. The novel method, Lean-FIRe, further improves conjecturing and autoformalisation and has successfully formalized several problems from the PutnamBench with notable efficacy using LLMs. The research advocates for a shift in focus towards improving conjecturing capabilities in formal mathematical reasoning, highlighting it as an essential yet underexplored facet. <div>
arXiv:2510.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This, however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1 and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation. Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

Summary:
SAGE is a new user simulation framework designed to evaluate multi-turn interactive agents. It incorporates top-down knowledge from business contexts, such as ideal customer profiles, to create realistic customer personas for user simulation. Additionally, SAGE integrates bottom-up knowledge from business agent infrastructure to generate interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a specific market. Empirical evaluation shows that SAGE produces more realistic and diverse interactions compared to existing approaches. It also identifies up to 33% more agent errors, making it an effective tool for bug-finding and agent improvement through iterative processes. SAGE bridges the gap between generic user simulation models and domain-specific principles, offering a more comprehensive evaluation approach for multi-turn interactive agents in various business contexts.

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior. We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles, grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

<div> Automatic Question Generation, Plagiarism, Discrete Mathematics, Academic Dishonesty, Linear-time Algorithm

Summary:
Automated Question Generation (AQG) is proposed as a solution to combat plagiarism in higher education by creating unique and diverse questions for students, specifically focusing on Discrete Mathematics. Existing AQGs have inefficiencies in question generation, prompting the development of a new approach that defines questions using a formal language and employs a linear-time algorithm. Experiments conducted to evaluate the system demonstrated that the accuracy of questions generated by the AQG is comparable to textbook questions. The difficulty level of generated questions was also found to be similar to textbook questions, validating the quality of the AQG in providing relevant and challenging practice questions to students. <div>

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally, AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language, translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions, textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

<div> Keywords: information extraction, neuro-symbolic system, large language model, agricultural domain, real-world applications

Summary: 
The paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) information extraction system with a large language model (LLM) based system in the agricultural domain. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS system in terms of overall performance, speed of deployment, and ease of maintenance. The NS approach offers advantages such as faster runtime and greater control but lacks generalizability and struggles with contextual nuances. On the other hand, the LLM-based system has higher performance but comes with drawbacks like slower runtime, model dependency, and hallucination risks. The study emphasizes the importance of balancing performance, efficiency, and control when deploying NLP systems in real-world applications. The findings highlight the trade-offs between the two approaches and the hidden costs associated with developing and maintaining such systems.

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details. However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime, limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control.

<div> Keywords: large language models, Curative Prompt Refinement, hallucination, prompt refinement, fine-tuned language model <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a framework designed to improve the quality of responses generated by large language models by refining poorly structured or vague prompts. CPR cleans ill-formed prompts and provides additional task descriptions to clarify user intentions. By fine-tuning a small language model, CPR aligns user intentions with the prompts to reduce the risk of generating incorrect facts or hallucinations. Empirical studies demonstrate that prompts refined with CPR achieve a significant improvement in generation quality and a reduction in hallucinations. The application of CPR results in over a 90\% win rate compared to original prompts without external knowledge. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

<div> Keywords: large language models, hallucinations, Multi-stage Prompt Refinement, prompt refinement, self-reflection mechanism

Summary:
Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR) is a framework designed to improve ill-formed prompts for large language models (LLMs) by addressing errors such as punctuation, typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation, typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\% win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Summary: 
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has become essential in addressing the reliability and trustworthiness concerns of large language models (LLMs). This includes measures to assess uncertainties such as epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in LLM outputs. The role of UQ in hallucination detection is crucial for identifying unreliable outputs that may contain factual inaccuracies. Various existing methods for hallucination detection in LLMs are categorized and analyzed, with empirical results provided for representative approaches. The limitations of current methods are discussed, and future research directions are outlined to further improve the trustworthiness of LLM outputs through uncertainty quantification.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for hallucination detection.

Summary:
Large language models are leveraged to refine user inputs for text-to-image (T2I) generation, improving image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics. A reward system and iterative training pipeline enhance prompts without supervised fine-tuning data. The prompt rewriter outperforms baselines across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Transferability is demonstrated as the rewriter trained on one backbone generalizes effectively to others. Scalability is studied, showing performance gains scaling with the capacity of the large LLM. Prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and model-agnostic strategy for enhancing T2I systems. Code and trained prompt rewriters will be released soon. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality. We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained prompt rewriters soon.

<div> Hierarchical Alignment, Direct Preference Optimization, Large Language Models, Transformer Architecture, Surgical Fine-Tuning

Summary:
Hierarchical Alignment introduces a targeted alignment method for Large Language Models, focusing on distinct functional blocks of model layers: local, intermediate, and global. Experimental results on models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA show significant improvements. Local-Align enhances grammatical fluency, while Global-Align is the most effective for logical coherence, outperforming baselines. The hierarchical strategies avoid the "alignment tax" seen in standard DPO. This approach offers a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable way to align models, highlighting the potential of structure-aware surgical fine-tuning for advanced LLM development.

<br /><br />Summary: 
1. Hierarchical Alignment targets specific functional blocks of model layers: local, intermediate, and global.
2. Experimental results demonstrate significant and predictable improvements in model performance.
3. Local-Align enhances grammatical fluency, while Global-Align is most effective for logical coherence.
4. The hierarchical strategies avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO.
5. This approach offers a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, showing potential for advanced LLM development. <div>
arXiv:2510.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture, where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate (logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge, demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly, aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO, where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more advanced and reliable LLMs.

<div> memory footprint, quadratic self-attention, ContextRot, long-context summarization tasks, APCE <br />
Summary:<br />
The paper addresses challenges in deploying Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs), focusing on memory efficiency and mitigating ContextRot effects. By selecting important input chunks using APCE, a context-aware solution, the proposed method reduces memory footprint and improves summarization performance. APCE operates independently of specific hardware or CUDA environments, making it adaptable for different deployment systems. Empirical evaluations show that APCE achieves comparable or superior summarization results to the full dense baseline, while using only a fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence. This approach enhances KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency in LCTMs, offering a promising solution for long-context tasks that require efficient processing. The research suggests future exploration of context-aware efficiency solutions to optimize LCTM performance across various applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length. Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards other relevant long-context tasks.

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets: the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939, sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive (0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain, though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho = 0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore, linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a greater diversity of associative patterns.

<div> Keywords: Multilingual domain adaptation, large language models, knowledge acquisition, cross-lingual transfer, bilingual corpus

Summary:
Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is crucial for transferring domain knowledge across languages to large language models (LLMs). Existing methods for ML-DA often fall short due to a lack of understanding of how domain knowledge is learned within a language and transferred across languages. In this study, the authors introduce AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that directly studies multilingual knowledge acquisition by building multiple-choice QA datasets from a bilingual domain corpus. By continually training LLMs with diverse data recipes, the study tracks how LLMs acquire domain facts and identifies the mechanism behind the transformation process from domain training data to knowledge. Experimenting with a 13B English-Japanese bilingual LLM, the results show that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging, even with a high-quality bilingual corpus. The code for this study has been made publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Summary: <br />
The study investigates the modality gap in Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) where performance differs between speech and text inputs. Coarse-grained analysis shows alignment in direction but divergence in magnitude between speech and text representations. This similarity is correlated with the modality gap. Fine-grained analysis reveals a token-level alignment pattern and introduces the Alignment Path Score to quantify alignment quality. Strategies like angle projection and length normalization on critical tokens show potential to improve correctness in speech inputs. The study provides theoretical and methodological guidance for optimizing LSLMs by understanding the modality gap and alignment mechanisms. <div>
arXiv:2510.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.

Summary:
SafeMT introduces a new benchmark, focusing on safety issues in multi-turn dialogues involving harmful queries and images. The benchmark includes 10,000 samples with varying scenarios and jailbreak methods. A Safety Index (SI) is proposed to assess the safety of Multiple Language Large Models (MLLMs) during conversations. Evaluation of 17 models using the benchmark reveals an increased risk of successful attacks with more turns in harmful dialogues, indicating inadequate safety mechanisms in current models. A dialogue safety moderator is proposed to detect malicious intent in conversations and provide relevant safety policies to MLLMs. Experimental results show the moderator's effectiveness in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existing guard models.

arXiv:2510.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts; however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index (SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed guard models.

<title>Credal Transformer: A Principled Approach for Quantifying and Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Hallucination, Credal Transformer, Uncertainty Quantification, AI reliability<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate factually incorrect assertions due to the Softmax function in Transformers creating "Artificial Certainty." The introduction of the Credal Transformer with Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based on evidential theory aims to mitigate this issue. CAM produces a "credal set" of distributions instead of a single attention vector, measuring model uncertainty. By re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution, the Credal Transformer can identify out-of-distribution inputs, quantify ambiguity, and reduce confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. This new architecture integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, enhancing AI reliability and providing a foundation for more trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.<br />

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer, which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions) instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution, representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a foundation for more reliable AI.

<div> Keywords: continuous space reasoning, diverse reasoning paths, dropout-based sampling, PRM and ORM models, inductive biases

Summary:
This paper explores the adaptation of established techniques for text-based reasoning to continuous space reasoning using the COCONUT model. By generating diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling, the potential for performance improvement is revealed. However, challenges arise in discriminating between correct and incorrect reasoning in the continuous space. Marginal improvements are seen when applying discrete space training techniques to the continuous space, indicating a need for inductive biases in continuous thought representations. The study delves into geometric properties and trajectory dynamics to identify the reasons behind ineffective discrimination. The authors suggest that training frameworks for continuous reasoning LMs should not only focus on accuracy but also on incorporating inductive biases for improved performance during inference. Overall, the research highlights the necessity of integrating inductive biases for effective continuous space reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning (essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data will be publicly available.}

Summary:
Drug repurposing is crucial for accelerating treatment discovery, particularly for complex and rare diseases. The proposed LLaDR framework enhances the representation of biomedical concepts within knowledge graphs by leveraging large language models to extract semantically enriched treatment-related textual representations. By fine-tuning knowledge graph embedding models with these representations, LLaDR injects treatment-relevant knowledge, leading to improved semantic understanding of under-studied or complex indications. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in various scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease confirming its effectiveness. The code for LLaDR is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery, especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models (LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

Summary:<br /><br />Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly used for audio understanding and multimodal reasoning but struggle with accurately predicting event timings. This study systematically examined temporal bias in LALMs and found that they often predict event timestamps that are inaccurate in relation to ground truth. The temporal bias was found to be common across datasets and models, increasing with audio length and varying depending on event types and positions. The Temporal Bias Index (TBI) was introduced to measure the misalignment in predicted event timings, highlighting the need for more temporally robust architectures in LALMs. These findings underscore a significant limitation in current LALMs and suggest the importance of further research and development in this area.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.12185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

<div> Keywords: simultaneous speech translation, segmentation models, Direct Preference Optimization, language models, real-time interpretation

Summary:
In this study, the researchers propose a segmentation framework for simultaneous speech translation that utilizes large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The aim is to improve segmentation accuracy, translation quality, and latency in real-time interpretation. By incorporating human preference alignment, the method enables LLMs to predict natural segmentation points more effectively. The experiments conducted on the ACL 60/60 corpus across three language pairs show that the DPO-tuned LLM outperforms existing models like SHAS in terms of segmentation accuracy, translation quality (measured by BLEU and COMET scores), and latency (Average Lagging). Comparisons with IWSLT baselines further demonstrate the system's effectiveness. These results highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs in advancing adaptive, human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2 as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive, human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, fairness evaluation, harm severity, deployment readiness, application domains<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) are being used in critical domains, necessitating thorough fairness and bias evaluation before deployment. The HALF framework introduced in this study considers harm severity and real-world scenarios, categorizing application domains into three tiers based on severity. Evaluation results of eight LLMs show inconsistencies in fairness across domains, indicating that model size or performance does not guarantee fairness. Reasoning models perform differently in medical decision support and education applications. The study highlights a gap between benchmarking success and deployment readiness, emphasizing the importance of addressing bias in LLMs for ethical deployment. <div>
arXiv:2510.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical. However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, biases, intentionality judgements, Layer-Patching analysis, targeted interventions

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, including the Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgments. Through a Layer-Patching analysis on 3 LLMs, researchers identified that this bias is learned during finetuning and localized in specific layers of the model. Surprisingly, patching activations from the pretrained model into critical layers effectively eliminated the bias, indicating targeted interventions can mitigate social biases in LLMs without requiring model retraining. This study provides insights into how biases manifest in LLMs and offers a promising approach for interpreting, localizing, and addressing biases in these models. Targeted interventions at specific layers can play a crucial role in addressing biases in LLMs, highlighting the potential for improving model fairness and reducing biased outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining.

<div> propose, Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening, multi-document question answering, long-range dependency modeling, lost-in-the-middle issue <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) as a solution to the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in multi-document question answering tasks. DSAS consists of two modules, Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) and Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS), which address the challenges of long-range dependency modeling and the "lost-in-the-middle" issue. The CGW module assesses paragraph relevance and position-aware weighting, while the RAS module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing irrelevant information exchange. DSAS does not require architectural modifications or additional training parameters, making it a plug-and-play solution. Experimental results on mainstream LLMs show an average F1-score improvement of 4.2% in multi-doc QA tasks. Ablation studies confirm the significance of both modules, and detailed discussions in the Appendix validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS. <div>
arXiv:2510.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the ''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS) module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces MedQA-Followup, a framework for assessing multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. It distinguishes between shallow and deep robustness and introduces an indirect-direct axis. Evaluating five LLMs on the MedQA dataset, the study finds that models perform well under shallow perturbations but exhibit vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings. Accuracy drops significantly under challenges across turns, with indirect interventions proving more harmful than direct suggestions. Model differences are also observed, with some showing performance drops under repeated interventions. These findings highlight the importance of multi-turn robustness for safe deployment of medical LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.12255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct). Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment. Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable deployment of medical LLMs.

Summary: <br />
Chinese ModernBERT is a new encoder designed specifically for the Chinese language. It incorporates a hardware-aware vocabulary, whole-word masking, extended pre-training pipeline, and a damped-cosine learning-rate schedule. The model is competitive with other Chinese encoders on the CLUE dataset and achieves high throughput for long sequences while maintaining speed for short sequences. By fine-tuning on open contrastive data, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses other models on the SimCLUE test set. The addition of T2Ranking data further enhances the model's performance. Tokenizer and weights will be released to facilitate reproducible research. <div>
arXiv:2510.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture, data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware 32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii) a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to 8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed, reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data: fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking (~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set. Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible research.

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches, our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention, opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

Empirical assessments using the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset demonstrate that the framework outperforms standard Large Language Model baselines and competitive approaches in generating high-quality counter-speech for different target groups. The study opens up possibilities for producing trustworthy and effective counter-speech in addressing hate speech and similar issues. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse language processing tasks.

<div> sparse activation, Mixture-of-Experts, MoBiLE, offloading strategy, GPU system

Summary:
MoBiLE is a new offloading-based framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, introducing a mixture of big-little experts to enhance efficiency. The framework reduces the number of experts for unimportant tokens while maintaining full experts for important tokens, ensuring model quality. A dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is implemented to switch between little and big experts for improved memory efficiency. Evaluation on modern MoE architectures and generative tasks demonstrate a speedup of 1.60x to 1.72x compared to the baseline on consumer GPU systems, with minimal impact on accuracy. The proposed approach addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a promising solution for optimizing MoE inference performance with fine-grained expert segmentation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck, existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference. These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality. Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to 1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible degradation in accuracy.

<div> bias, fairness, LLMs, peer review, research <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study explores the impact of integrating large language models (LLMs) as both reviewers and authors in the academic workflow. Through simulations and human annotations, the research finds that LLM reviewers exhibit biases such as inflating scores for LLM-authored papers and underrating human-authored papers with critical statements. These biases are attributed to preferences for LLM-generated writing styles and an aversion to critical feedback. The findings underscore the risks and equity concerns of using LLMs in the peer review process without proper caution. However, revisions guided by LLM reviews lead to quality improvements in evaluations for both LLM-based and human-authored papers, suggesting potential benefits for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality submissions. <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow, potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review, their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent, which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand, revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

Summary: 
- A study evaluated tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to identify disparities in large language models.
- Standardized preprocessing and tokenization processes were applied using the tiktoken library.
- Latin-script languages demonstrated higher tokenization efficiency compared to non-Latin and morphologically complex languages.
- Non-Latin languages often experienced significantly higher token inflation, leading to increased computational costs.
- The findings underscore the need for linguistically informed tokenization strategies to address computational disadvantages in AI systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations. This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces PRoH, a dynamic Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework, addressing limitations in existing KH-based RAG methods. PRoH incorporates a context-aware planning module for structurally grounded reasoning plan generation, a structured question decomposition process for adaptive exploration, and an EWO-guided reasoning path retrieval algorithm for coherent hyperedge traversals. Experiments show PRoH outperforms HyperGraphRAG, achieving a 19.73% increase in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation score. PRoH demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multi-hop question answering tasks, highlighting its robustness in long-range reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2510.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning, non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation; (ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive, multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation (G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Summary:
CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG) addresses the unfaithfulness issue in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems by analyzing hidden-state representations in Large Language Models. Findings from the probing-based analysis show that knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts are identified at the sentence level, and irrelevant context may be amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. The CLEAR framework decomposes context into fine-grained knowledge, localizes conflicting information using hidden-state probing, and introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide accurate integration of retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR significantly improves both accuracy and contextual faithfulness, outperforming strong baselines in various conflict conditions. The resources for CLEAR are available on GitHub at https://github.com/LinfengGao/CLEAR.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory, particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge, and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under diverse conflict conditions.

Summary: 
- The study examined the linguistic abilities of Large Language Models in a morphological generalization task across four languages.
- The models demonstrated human-like accuracy in generalizing morphological processes to unseen words.
- Model accuracy was found to be influenced more by the size of speaker communities and data availability rather than structural complexity.
- Languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital representation, such as Spanish and English, exhibited higher accuracy.
- The findings suggest that model behavior is driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather than sensitivity to grammatical complexity, indicating a superficial resemblance to human linguistic competence.

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words. Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However, accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Summary:
Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC) is a novel training framework designed to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional embeddings generated by large language models (LLMs). It introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning (SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on various datasets show that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For example, on the BEIR dataset, SMEC outperforms other models in compressing LLM2Vec embeddings to 256 dimensions, showing improvements of 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements, thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have advanced in generating personalized text, posing risks of identity impersonation. A benchmark dataset called \dataset is introduced to evaluate detector robustness in personalized settings, highlighting performance disparities among detectors. The feature-inversion trap, where discriminative features become misleading in personalized text, is identified as a key limitation. A method called \method is proposed to predict detector performance changes accurately in personalized settings by identifying latent feature directions and constructing probe datasets. This method shows an 85% correlation with actual performance gaps post-transfer. The study aims to spur further research in detecting personalized text to address the growing concern of identity impersonation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation, producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further research on personalized text detection.

Summary: 
Test-time scaling, a technique to enhance LLM outputs through additional computation, is typically applied in domains with correct answers like mathematics and coding. This study aims to transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025 tasks for evaluating annotation disagreements. Three test-time scaling methods were tested: Model Averaging, Majority Voting, and Best-of-N sampling. While the benchmark methods improved LLM performance on the tasks, the Best-of-N method did not show improvement. This suggests that the Best-of-N method may not directly transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks. The study provides insights into the challenges of applying test-time scaling techniques across different domains. <div>

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge, test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers, like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025 tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for this gap.

<div> prior, Vision Language Models, evaluation dataset, conceptual understanding, incongruent images

Summary:
The article discusses the tension between pragmatic and semantic priors in Vision Language Models (VLMs) when analyzing individual instances. VLMs learn generalized knowledge during training but are typically used for specific cases, leading to a conflict between the relevance of textual and visual inputs and the general truth of conceptual representations. The authors introduce a new evaluation dataset, VISaGE, comprising typical and exceptional images to study this trade-off. Experiments show that VLMs' conceptual understanding deteriorates when faced with incongruent images that challenge the pragmatic prior of input congruency. This degradation is more pronounced than the impact of the semantic prior when querying individual instances. The findings shed light on how VLMs balance conflicting priors and highlight the importance of congruent inputs for maintaining conceptual understanding. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category. In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images. In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge, creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or 'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering (QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings, StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts, demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for distinguishing machine-generated text.

Abstract: We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation, that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5 million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12 directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models (LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively, while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to 24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation domain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic domain and long-context translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent, high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the 'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models, particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs. Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most 8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks, although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

<title>Reasoning Pattern Matters: Learning to Reason without Human Rationales</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12643</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories (rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed, procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights, we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations. Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals, providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations. We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

<title>Omni-Captioner: Data Pipeline, Models, and Benchmark for Omni Detailed Perception</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective, we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable, efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such detailed captions.

<title>Which Word Orders Facilitate Length Generalization in LMs? An Investigation with GCG-Based Artificial Languages</title>

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell, 2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences. Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate, Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii) generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive. Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic "competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating, and interpreting language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning. Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Abstract: Creating speech datasets for low-resource languages is a critical yet poorly understood challenge, particularly regarding the actual cost in human labor. This paper investigates the time and complexity required to produce high-quality annotated speech data for a subset of low-resource languages, low literacy Predominately Oral Languages, focusing on Bambara, a Manding language of Mali. Through a one-month field study involving ten transcribers with native proficiency, we analyze the correction of ASR-generated transcriptions of 53 hours of Bambara voice data. We report that it takes, on average, 30 hours of human labor to accurately transcribe one hour of speech data under laboratory conditions and 36 hours under field conditions. The study provides a baseline and practical insights for a large class of languages with comparable profiles undertaking the creation of NLP resources.

Abstract: This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are: proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation; empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large language models in social science experiments.

Abstract: Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of 0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction. These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.

Abstract: This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers. Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of online political discourse during times of war.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable LLM--data integration.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation with significantly reduced training costs.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform complex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online information, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs with such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is especially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as biosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice: simply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can elicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the elevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet, jailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks, as they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap, we propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects malicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes harmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive experiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including general and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key findings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful prompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step planning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities that prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass refusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content, compared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental misalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to DR agents.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.

Abstract: Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal reasoning. This paper introduces U}nified Audio Language Model (UALM), which aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate, using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning. Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed by subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning, drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs reasoning with task demands.

<title>One Life to Learn: Inferring Symbolic World Models for Stochastic Environments from Unguided Exploration</title>

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only "one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure, activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex, hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO, our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured, object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments.

<title>Precise Attribute Intensity Control in Large Language Models via Targeted Representation Editing</title>

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods, however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks: preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1 and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g., instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Web applications are prime targets for cyberattacks as gateways to critical services and sensitive data. Traditional penetration testing is costly and expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet, their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.

Abstract: Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity. Audio samples are provided on https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DiSTAR_demo.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode. Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2 NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

<title>The Role of Parametric Injection-A Systematic Study of Parametric Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters (i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during inference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric level. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is more efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document interaction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric injection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that parameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents, and relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction at text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level document information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents within the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual documents, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and become more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either source alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents and advocate for increasing the information content of parametric representations to advance PRAG.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from $5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges. Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000 to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE), and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on $309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated $3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency, underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content anonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility. Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure anonymity in long-form audio.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts. This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward} ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a \textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82 to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation via self-rewarding.

Abstract: Incorporating structured knowledge into pre-trained language models has demonstrated signiffcant bene-ffts for domain-speciffc natural language processing tasks, particularly in specialized ffelds like military intelligence analysis. Existing approaches typically integrate external knowledge through masking tech-niques or fusion mechanisms, but often fail to fully leverage the intrinsic tactical associations and factual information within input sequences, while introducing uncontrolled noise from unveriffed exter-nal sources. To address these limitations, we present MLRIP (Military Language Representation with Integrated Prior), a novel pre-training framework that introduces a hierarchical knowledge integration pipeline combined with a dual-phase entity substitu-tion mechanism. Our approach speciffcally models operational linkages between military entities, capturing critical dependencies such as command, support, and engagement structures. Comprehensive evaluations on military-speciffc NLP tasks show that MLRIP outperforms existing BERT-based models by substantial margins, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in military entity recognition, typing, and operational linkage extraction tasks while demonstrating superior operational efffciency in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a dataset for the computational study of a number of Modern Greek dialects. It consists of raw text data from four dialects of Modern Greek, Cretan, Pontic, Northern Greek and Cypriot Greek. The dataset is of considerable size, albeit imbalanced, and presents the first attempt to create large scale dialectal resources of this type for Modern Greek dialects. We then use the dataset to perform dialect idefntification. We experiment with traditional ML algorithms, as well as simple DL architectures. The results show very good performance on the task, potentially revealing that the dialects in question have distinct enough characteristics allowing even simple ML models to perform well on the task. Error analysis is performed for the top performing algorithms showing that in a number of cases the errors are due to insufficient dataset cleaning.

<title>When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.

Abstract: Few-shot named entity recognition can identify new types of named entities based on a few labeled examples. Previous methods employing token-level or span-level metric learning suffer from the computational burden and a large number of negative sample spans. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning (MsFNER), which splits the general NER into two stages: entity-span detection and entity classification. There are 3 processes for introducing MsFNER: training, finetuning, and inference. In the training process, we train and get the best entity-span detection model and the entity classification model separately on the source domain using meta-learning, where we create a contrastive learning module to enhance entity representations for entity classification. During finetuning, we finetune the both models on the support dataset of target domain. In the inference process, for the unlabeled data, we first detect the entity-spans, then the entity-spans are jointly determined by the entity classification model and the KNN. We conduct experiments on the open FewNERD dataset and the results demonstrate the advance of MsFNER.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that integrating new modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), creates a new attack surface that bypasses existing safety training techniques like Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). While further SFT and RLHF-based safety training can be conducted in multi-modal settings, collecting multi-modal training datasets poses a significant challenge. Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where, regardless of the combination of input modalities, all inputs are ultimately fused into the language space, we aim to explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our evaluation across six datasets empirically demonstrates the transferability -- textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8\% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2\% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside preserving the utility. Moreover, our experiments show that unlearning with a multi-modal dataset offers no potential benefits but incurs significantly increased computational demands, possibly up to 6 times higher.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced natural language processing, driving significant breakthroughs in tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and domain-specific reasoning. The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces AFRIDOC-MT, a document-level multi-parallel translation dataset covering English and five African languages: Amharic, Hausa, Swahili, Yor\`ub\'a, and Zulu. The dataset comprises 334 health and 271 information technology news documents, all human-translated from English to these languages. We conduct document-level translation benchmark experiments by evaluating neural machine translation (NMT) models and large language models (LLMs) for translations between English and these languages, at both the sentence and pseudo-document levels. These outputs are realigned to form complete documents for evaluation. Our results indicate that NLLB-200 achieved the best average performance among the standard NMT models, while GPT-4o outperformed general-purpose LLMs. Fine-tuning selected models led to substantial performance gains, but models trained on sentences struggled to generalize effectively to longer documents. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that some LLMs exhibit issues such as under-generation, repetition of words or phrases, and off-target translations, especially for African languages.

<title>ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

<title>From Rational Answers to Emotional Resonance: The Role of Controllable Emotion Generation in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Purpose: Emotion is a fundamental component of human communication, shaping understanding, trust, and engagement across domains such as education, healthcare, and mental health. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning and knowledge generation capabilities, they still struggle to express emotions in a consistent, controllable, and contextually appropriate manner. This limitation restricts their potential for authentic human-AI interaction. Methods: We propose a controllable emotion generation framework based on Emotion Vectors (EVs) - latent representations derived from internal activation shifts between neutral and emotion-conditioned responses. By injecting these vectors into the hidden states of pretrained LLMs during inference, our method enables fine-grained, continuous modulation of emotional tone without any additional training or architectural modification. We further provide theoretical analysis proving that EV steering enhances emotional expressivity while maintaining semantic fidelity and linguistic fluency. Results: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that the proposed approach achieves consistent emotional alignment, stable topic adherence, and controllable affect intensity. Compared with existing prompt-based and fine-tuning-based baselines, our method demonstrates superior flexibility and generalizability. Conclusion: Emotion Vector (EV) steering provides an efficient and interpretable means of bridging rational reasoning and affective understanding in large language models, offering a promising direction for building emotionally resonant AI systems capable of more natural human-machine interaction.

Abstract: While reasoning and multilingual capabilities in language models (LMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, their integration into a unified paradigm - multilingual reasoning - is at a nascent stage. Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks. Rapid growth of evolving developments in this field can be actively tracked on our project page: [https://github.com/AkashGhosh/Survey-of-Multilingual-Reasoning-in-Language-Models](https://github.com/AkashGhosh/Survey-of-Multilingual-Reasoning-in-Language-Models)

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.

Abstract: Existing challenges in misinformation exposure and susceptibility vary across demographic groups, as some populations are more vulnerable to misinformation than others. Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores the interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in the context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents has created a new ecosystem of strategic, agent-to-agent interactions. However, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: in high-stakes, emotion-sensitive domains like debt collection, LLM agents pre-trained on human dialogue are vulnerable to exploitation by adversarial counterparts who simulate negative emotions to derail negotiations. To fill this gap, we first contribute a novel dataset of simulated debt recovery scenarios and a multi-agent simulation framework. Within this framework, we introduce EmoDebt, an LLM agent architected for robust performance. Its core innovation is a Bayesian-optimized emotional intelligence engine that reframes a model's ability to express emotion in negotiation as a sequential decision-making problem. Through online learning, this engine continuously tunes EmoDebt's emotional transition policies, discovering optimal counter-strategies against specific debtor tactics. Extensive experiments on our proposed benchmark demonstrate that EmoDebt achieves significant strategic robustness, substantially outperforming non-adaptive and emotion-agnostic baselines across key performance metrics, including success rate and operational efficiency. By introducing both a critical benchmark and a robustly adaptive agent, this work establishes a new foundation for deploying strategically robust LLM agents in adversarial, emotion-sensitive debt interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have led to a growing number of papers related to finance in top-tier Natural Language Processing (NLP) venues. To systematically examine this trend, we review 374 NLP research papers published between 2017 and 2024 across 38 conferences and workshops, with a focused analysis of 221 papers that directly address finance-related tasks. We evaluate these papers across 11 quantitative and qualitative dimensions, and our study identifies the following opportunities for NLP researchers: (i) expanding the scope of forecasting tasks; (ii) enriching evaluation with financial metrics; (iii) leveraging multilingual and crisis-period datasets; and (iv) balancing PLMs with efficient or interpretable alternatives. We identify actionable directions supported by dataset and tool recommendations, with implications for both the academia and industry communities.

Abstract: We introduce AgentAda, the first LLM-powered analytics agent that can learn and use new analytics skills to extract more specialized insights. Unlike existing methods that require users to manually decide which data analytics method to apply, AgentAda automatically identifies the skill needed from a library of analytical skills to perform the analysis. This also allows AgentAda to use skills that existing LLMs cannot perform out of the box. The library covers a range of methods, including clustering, predictive modeling, and NLP techniques like BERT, which allow AgentAda to handle complex analytics tasks based on what the user needs. AgentAda's dataset-to-insight extraction strategy consists of three key steps: (I) a question generator to generate queries relevant to the user's goal and persona, (II) a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based skill matcher to choose the best data analytics skill from the skill library, and (III) a code generator that produces executable code based on the retrieved skill's documentation to extract key patterns. We also introduce KaggleBench, a benchmark of curated notebooks across diverse domains, to evaluate AgentAda's performance. We conducted a human evaluation demonstrating that AgentAda provides more insightful analytics than existing tools, with 48.78% of evaluators preferring its analyses, compared to 27.67% for the unskilled agent. We also propose a novel LLM-as-a-judge approach that we show is aligned with human evaluation as a way to automate insight quality evaluation at larger scale.

Abstract: To explore the relationship between dependency distance (DD) and hierarchical distance (HD) in Japanese, we compared the probability distributions of DD and HD with and without sentence length fixed, and analyzed the changes in mean dependency distance (MDD) and mean hierarchical distance (MHD) as sentence length increases, along with their correlation coefficient based on the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese. It was found that the valency of the predicates is the underlying factor behind the trade-off relation between MDD and MHD in Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese regulate the linear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the predicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the threshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the valency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and HD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is greater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability distributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we study lightweight extensions to BERT that refine the [CLS] representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens. Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii) combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach, called MaxPoolBERT, enhances BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without requiring new pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better performance than the standard BERT base model on low resource tasks of the GLUE benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting predefined stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle when stylistic requirements are implicitly represented by a set of examples, such as texts produced by a specific human translator. In this work, we explore various strategies for personalizing automatically generated translations when few examples are available, with a focus on the challenging domain of literary translation. We begin by determining the feasibility of the task and how style information is encoded within model representations. Then, we evaluate various prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, with a particular focus on contrastive steering with sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to identify salient personalization properties. We demonstrate that contrastive SAE steering yields robust style conditioning and translation quality, resulting in higher inference-time computational efficiency than prompting approaches. We further examine the impact of steering on model activations, finding that layers encoding personalization properties are impacted similarly by prompting and SAE steering, suggesting a similar mechanism at play.

Abstract: Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

<title>Leveraging Importance Sampling to Detach Alignment Modules from Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Recent thinking models trained with reinforcement learning and backward-checking CoT often suffer from overthinking: they produce excessively long outputs even on simple problems, wasting computation. Existing evaluations, based on token efficiency, give an incomplete view as they neglect problem difficulty and intermediate computation costs. We formalize reasoning efficiency as a relative measure between thinking and instruct models, treating instruct models as the minimal-effort baseline. A systematic study across four thinking models and multiple benchmarks reveals two consistent patterns: (i) instruct models achieve higher efficiency overall, and (ii) problem difficulty affects efficiency, with thinking models wasting computation on easy problems but providing value on harder ones. Building on this insight, we propose COTHINK, a simple two-stage pipeline: an instruct model drafts a brief outline, and a thinking model expands it. On GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, COTHINK cuts token usage by 21.1% while keeping accuracy on four thinking models, and remains competitive with strong efficiency baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and achieved remarkable performance in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Recently, distilling reasoning ability from long-form Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs). Existing studies typically treat SLMs as student models and use long-form CoTs as supervision signals for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to transfer reasoning ability. However, such long-form CoT teachers are usually unaware of the student model's capacity, which limits the effective utilization of the provided reasoning traces. To overcome this limitation, we propose errOr-aware self-ReflectION (ORION), a framework that refines teacher CoTs through an Error-Aware Reflection process. ORION enables the student model to construct more tailored teacher CoTs by refining teacher CoTs and incorporating its own reasoning errors. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ORION consistently improves performance by more than 2% over all baselines. Further analysis reveals that the CoTs constructed by ORION exhibit higher coherence and logical consistency, thereby serving as more effective supervision signals for SFT. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/ORION.git.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons. An anonymized version of DefenderBench is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DefenderBench.

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text embedding models primarily focus on data scaling or synthesis, yet limited exploration of training techniques and data quality, thereby constraining performance. In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as backtracking, self-reflection, and self-correction. Despite these developments, the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence on the final prediction. I.e., errors introduced at this stage can substantially degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed across various state-of-the-art open- and closed-source reasoning models. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in inference cost without sacrificing any accuracy. Our work highlights the central role of the first reasoning step in generating a high-quality reasoning trajectory, and thus enabling significantly efficient sampling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to large language model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are the cornerstone of the semantic web, offering up-to-date representations of real-world entities and relations. Yet large language models (LLMs) remain largely static after pre-training, causing their internal knowledge to become outdated and limiting their utility in time-sensitive web applications. To bridge this gap between dynamic knowledge and static models, a prevalent approach is to enhance LLMs with KGs. However, prevailing methods typically rely on parameter-invasive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and often degrades LLMs' general capabilities. Moreover, their static integration frameworks cannot keep pace with the continuous evolution of real-world KGs, hindering their deployment in dynamic web environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce KGA (\textit{\underline{K}nowledge \underline{G}raph-guided \underline{A}ttention}), a novel framework that dynamically integrates external KGs into LLMs exclusively at inference-time without any parameter modification. Inspired by research on neuroscience, we rewire the self-attention module by innovatively introducing two synergistic pathways: a \textit{bottom-up knowledge fusion} pathway and a \textit{top-down attention guidance} pathway. The \textit{bottom-up pathway} dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion, which is akin to the \textit{stimulus-driven attention process} in the human brain. Complementarily, the \textit{top-down pathway} aims to assess the contextual relevance of each triple through a \textit{goal-directed verification process}, thereby suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. By synergistically combining these two pathways, our method supports real-time knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks verify KGA's strong fusion performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions; (2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) power numerous AI applications, yet updating their knowledge remains costly. Model editing provides a lightweight alternative through targeted parameter modifications, with meta-learning-based model editing (MLME) demonstrating strong effectiveness and efficiency. However, we find that MLME struggles in low-data regimes and incurs high training costs due to the use of KL divergence. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{Edit (EMSEdit)}$, which leverages multi-step backpropagation (MSBP) to effectively capture gradient-activation mapping patterns within editing samples, performs multi-step edits per sample to enhance editing performance under limited data, and introduces norm-based regularization to preserve unedited knowledge while improving training efficiency. Experiments on two datasets and three LLMs show that EMSEdit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sequential and batch editing. Moreover, MSBP can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches to yield additional performance gains. Further experiments on a multi-hop reasoning editing task demonstrate EMSEdit's robustness in handling complex edits, while ablation studies validate the contribution of each design component. Our code is available at https://github.com/xpq-tech/emsedit.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200 prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions: Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx -1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI) against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural hegemony.

<title>Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding</title>

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/pixeli99/Prophet.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. To encourage diversity and reduce redundancy, we design a redundancy penalty that discourages repeated similar queries. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.

Abstract: Cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques keep reshaping our view of the world. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1) arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics, accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their works in diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Purpose: Large language models (LLMs) have proven performance for certain diagnostic tasks, however limited studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens for a given diagnosis. Medication management is a complex task that requires synthesis of drug formulation and complete order instructions for safe use. Here, the performance of GPT 4o, an LLM available with ChatGPT, was tested for three medication management tasks. Methods: GPT-4o performance was tested using three medication tasks: identifying available formulations for a given generic drug name, identifying drug-drug interactions (DDI) for a given medication regimen, and preparing a medication order for a given generic drug name. For each experiment, the models raw text response was captured exactly as returned and evaluated using clinician evaluation in addition to standard LLM metrics, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF IDF) vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE 1/ROUGE L F1) between each response and its reference string. Results: For the first task of drug-formulation matching, GPT-4o had 49% accuracy for generic medications being matched to all available formulations, with an average of 1.23 omissions per medication and 1.14 hallucinations per medication. For the second task of drug-drug interaction identification, the accuracy was 54.7% for identifying the DDI pair. For the third task, GPT-4o generated order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors in 65.8% of cases. Conclusions: Model performance for basic medication tasks was consistently poor. This evaluation highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop. CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured, precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$ as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using $\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN) and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression, where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer. Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost} Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function, as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers. \textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and $\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style router function \methodNorm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.

<title>The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data. Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization. Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/lens

<title>Graph2Eval: Automatic Multimodal Task Generation for Agents via Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks. Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on 56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and 18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all available target data for ranking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on static medical Question Answering (QA) tasks, yet their reasoning often deteriorates in multi-turn clinical dialogues where patient information is scattered across turns. This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.

Abstract: Deception is a pervasive feature of human communication and an emerging concern in large language models (LLMs). While recent studies document instances of LLM deception under pressure, most evaluations remain confined to single-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which deceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce the first simulation framework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences of interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework instantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing tasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and maintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then reviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and open-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with event pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses further reveal distinct strategies of concealment, equivocation, and falsification. Our findings establish deception as an emergent risk in long-horizon interactions and provide a foundation for evaluating future LLMs in real-world, trust-sensitive contexts.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) has achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool module, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal function module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular Question Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal agent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset QRData, the causal agent is 6\% higher than the original SOTA. For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/kairong-han/causal_agent.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems generate real-time transcriptions but often miss nuances that human interpreters capture. While ASR is useful in many contexts, interpreters-who already use ASR tools such as Dragon-add critical value, especially in sensitive settings such as diplomatic meetings where subtle language is key. Human interpreters not only perceive these nuances but can adjust in real time, improving accuracy, while ASR handles basic transcription tasks. However, ASR systems introduce a delay that does not align with real-time interpretation needs. The user-perceived latency of ASR systems differs from that of interpretation because it measures the time between speech and transcription delivery. To address this, we propose a new approach to measuring delay in ASR systems and validate if they are usable in live interpretation scenarios.

Abstract: Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is not always sufficient to capture the full range and complexity of general human preferences. We explore RLHF under a general preference framework by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game in a game-theoretic framework, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous self-play algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or only converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. We provide theoretical analysis that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of synthetic and preference optimization datasets. COMAL is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for preference optimization with minimal changes, and empirically it consistently maintains above 60.2% and 56.8% win rates, when applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B, against all compared algorithms under controlled evaluations.

Abstract: Local citation recommendation (LCR) suggests a set of papers for a citation placeholder within a given context. The task has evolved as generative approaches have become more promising than the traditional pre-fetch and re-rank-based state-of-the-art approaches. This paper introduces citation-specific pre-training within an encoder-decoder architecture, where author-date citation tokens are masked to learn to reconstruct them to fulfill LCR. There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only base scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to learn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the local context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning signal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks except for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the advantage of generative pre-training. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv., with the Refseer benchmark-trained model emerging as the best-performing model. We perform comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, a qualitative analysis, and a taxonomy of hallucinations with detailed statistics. Our analyses confirm that CiteBART-Global has a cross-dataset generalization capability; the macro hallucination rate (MaHR) at the top-3 predictions is 4\%, and when the ground-truth is in the top-k prediction list, the hallucination tendency in the other predictions drops significantly.

Abstract: The optimal bit-width for achieving the best trade-off between quantized model size and accuracy has been a subject of ongoing debate. While some advocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior results. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left such conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified framework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning transition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models stay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning 2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing training schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all previous methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ ternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary 3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters. Extensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization maintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally exceeds 4-bit and binary quantization. Considering hardware constraints, 2-bit quantization offers promising potential for memory reduction and speedup.

Abstract: Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use. Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2) generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/IMM-TSF.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a \textbf{Token Importance Recurrence} phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose \textbf{LazyEviction}, an observation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring tokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache by 50\%\textasciitilde70\% while maintaining comparable accuracy, outperforming existing KV cache compression baselines. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/Halo-949/LazyEviction.

<title>Revela: Dense Retriever Learning via Language Modeling</title>

Abstract: Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly to create and scarce in specialized domains (e.g., code) or in complex settings (e.g., requiring reasoning). These practical challenges have sparked growing interest in self-supervised retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next token prediction), we can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens. This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?
  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next token prediction on local and cross-document context through an in-batch attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language modeling. We evaluate Revela on domain-specific (CoIR), reasoning-intensive (BRIGHT), and general-domain (BEIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. Without annotated or synthetic query-document pairs, Revela surpasses larger supervised models and proprietary APIs on CoIR and matches them on BRIGHT. It achieves BEIR's unsupervised SoTA with ~ 1000x less training data and 10x less compute. Performance increases with batch size and model size, highlighting Revela's scalability and its promise for self-supervised retriever learning.

<title>OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device Speculative Decoding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.02659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.

<title>Attention-Aware GNN-based Input Defense against Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07146</link>

arXiv:2507.07146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in various applications, yet their capabilities present risks for both constructive and malicious exploitation. Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate.
  In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.

arXiv:2508.20353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by Dynamic Information Flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37\% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38\% in retrieval recall, and 6.45\% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios. Our code are anonymous available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DFAMS/

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), a significant gap remains between research and practical deployment. Many studies assess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of the Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an ad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users' information needs in multiple languages. We prepared eleven retrieval models employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual, translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications.

arXiv:2509.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that facilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving effective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a 39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines, including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable, cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.

<title>MoEs Are Stronger than You Think: Hyper-Parallel Inference Scaling with RoE</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction. To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.

arXiv:2510.03269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.

Summary: 
This study focuses on the deployment of large language models as business development agents for persuasive price negotiation in online travel agencies. The agents must adhere to specific operating procedures and business constraints while interacting with customers. Traditional approaches like supervised fine-tuning often fall short in capturing nuanced persuasion styles and enforcing constraints. The proposed Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO) framework uses reinforcement learning to align the language model with various rewards, including human alignment, persuasive behavior, and business constraints. In evaluations, REPO outperforms other methods in improving dialogue quality, achieving a high rate of fixing bad cases and demonstrating emergent capabilities such as proactive empathy and localized reasoning. <div>

Abstract: We study deploying large language models (LLMs) as business development (BD) agents for persuasive price negotiation in online travel agencies (OTAs), where aligning traveler affordability and hotel profitability directly affects bookings, partner relationships, and access to travel. The agent must follow a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while conducting multi-turn persuasion, interpreting colloquial inputs, and adhering to guardrails (no over-promising, no hallucinations). Conventional post-training -- supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or single-source reward optimization -- overfits scripts, misses nuanced persuasive style, and fails to enforce verifiable business constraints.
  We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards: a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics, formatting, and guardrails. A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve negotiation quality. In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); +0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to 66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO. We also observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning, calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in detecting demographic-targeted social biases in web-scraped text corpora.
- Previous research on bias detection in text datasets is limited in scope, often focusing on single content types and demographic axes.

- Different techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning, are evaluated across twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics.
- While fine-tuned smaller models show promise for scalable bias detection, gaps are identified in detecting biases across demographic axes and multiple demographics simultaneously, highlighting the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

<br />
Large language models are generating natural language rationales for patent classification tasks, but these rationales may contain errors and misalignments. To address this issue, a new framework called Self-Filtered Distillation is proposed. This framework treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth labels and uses three unsupervised trust metrics to guide the distillation process. These metrics evaluate the stability of rationales, semantic coherence with patent class definitions, and the plausibility of rationale-label pairs. By integrating these metrics into a unified trust score, the framework prioritizes high-trust training samples while optionally filtering out low-trust cases. Experimental results on a patent classification dataset show that the proposed method outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation in terms of accuracy, stability, and interpretability. This approach establishes a reliable method for leveraging reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

The Self-Filtered Distillation framework is introduced for patent classification using large language models. It treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals and employs three unsupervised trust metrics for guidance. These metrics evaluate stability, semantic coherence, and plausibility of rationales, leading to a unified trust score that prioritizes high-trust training samples and filters out low-trust cases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors, label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation, a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision. The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, problem difficulty, linear probe, attention heads, entropy

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the ability to implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations, as demonstrated through linear modeling of math problem difficulty using final-token representations. Specific attention heads in the final Transformer layer have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems, indicating a perception of difficulty. Ablation experiments confirm the accuracy of the attention heads' location. LLMs can serve as automatic difficulty annotators, reducing the need for human labeling in benchmark construction and curriculum learning. Additionally, a significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level was observed. This study reveals that LLMs not only perceive difficulty but also have a structured organization in their difficulty perception, providing theoretical insights and practical implications for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators, potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level. Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical directions for future research.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards, Token Hidden Reward, Group Relative Policy Optimization, exploration, exploitation

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on enhancing the training of large language models using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. A new metric, Token Hidden Reward (THR), is introduced to quantify each token's impact on correct responses during training. This metric plays a crucial role in balancing exploration and exploitation in the learning process. By identifying tokens with high absolute THR values, the study shows that positive THR values promote exploitation by increasing confidence in correct outputs, whereas negative THR values prioritize exploration by preserving probability mass for alternative outputs. An algorithm is proposed that leverages THR values to adjust learning signals and bias training towards either exploration or exploitation, leading to improved accuracy in various math reasoning tasks. The algorithm is shown to be effective across different architectures and RL objectives, offering a targeted approach to fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation, question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly evolving area.

<div> Keywords: logical fallacies, emotional framing, convincingness, large language models, fallacy detection

Summary:
This study investigates how emotional framing affects fallacious arguments and convincingness in public communication. By using large language models (LLMs), researchers systematically explored the impact of emotional appeals on fallacies and convincingness. The experiment involved injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while maintaining logical structures. The results showed that LLM-driven emotional framing significantly lowered human fallacy detection by 14.5%. Interestingly, participants were more adept at detecting fallacies when emotions of enjoyment were present compared to fear or sadness. Furthermore, enjoyment, fear, and sadness were found to be correlated with higher convincingness in arguments than neutral or other emotional states. The study offers insights into the role of AI-driven emotional manipulation in the realm of fallacious argumentation. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Emotional framing influences the detection of fallacies in arguments, with LLM-driven appeals reducing detection rates by 14.5%. 
- Enjoyment as an emotion leads to better fallacy detection compared to fear or sadness. 
- Emotional states of enjoyment, fear, and sadness are associated with higher convincingness in arguments. 
- LLMs play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of emotional manipulation in fallacious communication. <div>

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation in the context of fallacious argumentation.

<div> approach, large language models, logical consistency, pattern recognition, limitations  
Summary:  
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a tendency to generate absurd patterns when tasked with identifying regularities in number series. While successful in identifying patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, LLMs often incorrectly recognize patterns in randomly generated series. This issue persists in multi-step reasoning models, indicating potential limitations in their logical reasoning capabilities. The tendency to perceive non-existent patterns raises concerns about the reliability of LLMs in real-world tasks requiring logical coherence. This study highlights the need to evaluate LLMs' logical consistency and consider countermeasures to address their tendency to generate inaccurate patterns. <div>
arXiv:2510.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

<div> semantic filtering, conflict-free framework, retrieval-augmented generation, trustworthiness, generation robustness <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The first stage involves joint filtering using semantic and cluster-based methods guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE) to selectively add valuable documents. The second stage includes an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module that analyzes semantic consistency to filter out contradictions. This approach aims to preserve useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, enhancing generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Experimental results across various large language models and datasets show that the proposed SeCon-RAG outperforms existing defense methods significantly. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.

Summary:
ReaLM is a new framework that addresses the challenge of integrating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings with Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). It uses residual vector quantization to discretize KG embeddings and integrate them into LLM vocabularies. This allows for seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual knowledge, enhancing semantic transfer. ReaLM also incorporates ontology-guided class constraints to ensure semantic consistency in entity predictions based on class-level compatibility. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that ReaLM outperforms existing methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for aligning structured knowledge with LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance. To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language models.

<div> ciphered reasoning, harmful AI actions, CoT monitoring, adversarial attacks, model accuracy

Summary: 
Ciphered reasoning, used to evade Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring for detecting harmful AI actions, was tested on models with various ciphers. While models could accurately translate ciphered text to English, their reasoning accuracy dropped significantly in ciphered text. Frontier models struggled with lesser-known ciphers but performed well in well-known ciphers like rot13. Ciphered reasoning capability improved slowly with more fine-tuning data, and its effectiveness correlated with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. Overall, evading CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning may not be effective for current models, providing insight for future model development. <div>
arXiv:2510.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption. Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents by integrating long-term memory. Existing approaches lack mechanisms for updating memory as user behaviors evolve. PAMU combines sliding window averages and exponential moving averages to create a preference-aware representation that captures short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies. Experimental results on LoCoMo dataset task scenarios demonstrate PAMU's ability to significantly enhance the output quality of LLM in five baselines, particularly in long-term conversations. <div>

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW) with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its effectiveness in long-term conversations.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models (VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs. Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns: human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1 performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11 closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different evaluation needs.

Summary:
The article introduces Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that utilizes the position bias of large language models as a diagnostic signal to identify relevant content in multi-document contexts. By reordering documents and observing shifts in the model's responses, the framework efficiently identifies the most relevant information. The problem of choosing reorderings is framed as a bipartite matching problem, with a proposed greedy strategy achieving comparable performance to the optimal assignment computed with the Hungarian algorithm. This approach significantly reduces computational cost without the need for model retraining, identifying relevant documents using up to 65% fewer language model queries than random permutation baselines. The study showcases the transformation of inherent biases in language models from liabilities into assets for efficient inference-time optimization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated, we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem. While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$ strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds. PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines (60.75) and random approaches (14.65).

Summary:
RISE introduces a geometric approach called Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation that represents semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding space. This method leverages the manifold structure of modern language representations to provide interpretable geometric properties. The study evaluates RISE across multiple embedding models, datasets, and languages and demonstrates its ability to map discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features across languages and models. The results suggest the existence of cross-lingual geometric structure and support the Linear Representation Hypothesis at the sentence level. This work highlights the importance of understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships for model interpretability and control. <div>

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' + ''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations. RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features (e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis at the sentence level.

Summary: 
Nutrition Question Answering (QA) is important for personalized dietary guidance and preventing chronic diseases. Existing methods face challenges due to limited reasoning capacity and contextual overload. The Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router) framework addresses these challenges by formulating nutritional QA as a multi-agent collaboration problem guided by knowledge graphs. It uses a graph neural network to learn routing distributions over agents and employs a gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism to enhance reasoning. Results show that NG-Router outperforms single-agent and ensemble baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex nutritional health tasks. This framework offers a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent reasoning, showcasing the potential for improved dietary guidance and disease prevention.

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering (QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

Summary:
The article introduces NarraBench, a taxonomy for narrative-understanding tasks, and surveys 78 existing benchmarks in this area. It identifies a need for new evaluations that cover overlooked aspects of narrative understanding not well aligned with current metrics. Only 27% of narrative tasks are adequately covered by existing benchmarks, with certain areas such as narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation lacking representation. There is a call for the development of benchmarks that can assess subjective and perspectival aspects of narratives where there may not be a single correct answer. The findings of this study will benefit NLP researchers looking to test language models' narrative understanding capabilities.

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area. We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas -- including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, conversational biases, adversarial attacks, bias amplification, ethical behavior <br />
Summary: <br />
This study introduces CoBia, a suite of adversarial attacks to analyze how Large Language Models (LLMs) deviate from normative behavior in conversations. By creating biased conversation scenarios, the researchers evaluate 11 LLMs' responses related to various socio-demographic categories. The results show that LLMs often amplify bias and struggle to reject biased follow-up questions, highlighting the presence of deeply embedded biases. The study emphasizes the importance of stress-testing models to assess their reliability and alignment with ethical standards. The findings suggest that improvements are needed in model construction to prevent harmful behavior like expressing racist viewpoints in conversations. The code and artifacts used in the study are available for further examination on GitHub. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails, allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks. However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race, religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue. This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at https://github.com/nafisenik/CoBia.

<div> BERT, iBERT, interpretable, embeddings, style

Summary: 
iBERT is introduced as an encoder that aims to produce interpretable and controllable embeddings by modularizing and exposing discriminative cues in language. It represents each input token as a sparse, non-negative mixture over context-independent sense vectors, allowing for modular control over representation. The model's interpretability is demonstrated through evaluations on style-focused tasks, showing an improvement in style representation effectiveness on the STEL benchmark and competitive performance on authorship verification. iBERT's modular structure enables the assignment of specific style attributes to individual sense vectors, such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling. While the experiments focus on style, iBERT is designed to interpretably decompose diverse discriminative signals in the data, facilitating generalization even when supervision encompasses both stylistic and semantic factors. <div>
arXiv:2510.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and semantic factors.

<div> sparse attention, large reasoning models, DELTA, computational efficiency, model accuracy

Summary:
DELTA is a new sparse attention mechanism designed to improve the computational efficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs) without compromising model accuracy. It partitions transformer layers into three groups: initial layers using full attention, selection layers identifying salient tokens, and sparse-attention layers attending only to selected tokens. By selectively reusing attention maps, DELTA achieves up to 5x reduction in attended tokens while delivering a 1.5x end-to-end speedup on reasoning tasks like AIME and GPQA-Diamond. The approach maintains the full key-value (KV) cache for accuracy, addressing the accuracy degradation and dynamic importance challenges faced by existing sparse attention methods. DELTA's performance matches or surpasses that of full attention models on reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its efficacy in efficient long-context reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present \textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering $1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context reasoning.

<div> fine-tuning, large language models, autoregressive, masked diffusion, knowledge injection 
Summary:
Fine-tuning autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) faces challenges such as the "reversal curse," hindering knowledge injection. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) show promise in overcoming these limitations, proving more data-efficient and immune to the reversal curse during pre-training. By evaluating arLLMs and dLLMs on various datasets with forward and backward Question Answering (QA), researchers found that dLLMs outperformed arLLMs without the need for data augmentation via paraphrases. Additionally, a novel masked fine-tuning method was introduced to enhance knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs, improving data efficiency and bridging the performance gap between arLLMs and dLLMs. This study highlights the potential of dLLMs in knowledge acquisition and suggests promising avenues for further research in language modeling. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training. However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs, evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

Summary:<br />
Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet, even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), tend to be overconfident and provide the same conservative response to different prompts. This failure is attributed to the neglect of counterfactual prompts in existing preference learning. To address this, abductive preference learning is proposed, reversing the conventional conditioning by learning preferences over prompts given a response. Experiments using an abductive dataset derived from HaluEval QA benchmark show that abductive methods improve prompt discrimination, standard methods improve response selection, and multitask objectives unify both, boosting accuracy in both response selection and prompt discrimination. Evaluation on AlpacaEval confirms that abductive preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference optimization while addressing the challenge of counterfactual prompts. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance, they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt, while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries, implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to $99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual prompts.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a brain-inspired framework called HIPPD for personality detection from text. HIPPD mimics the hierarchical information processing of the human brain by using a large language model to simulate the cerebral cortex for global semantic reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, resembling the prefrontal cortex, is incorporated for adaptive gating and feature retention based on dopaminergic prediction error feedback. Specialized lightweight models, acting like the basal ganglia, are dynamically routed to capture personality-related patterns efficiently. HIPPD outperforms existing machine learning approaches on Kaggle and Pandora datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in extracting robust features in semantically sparse environments. <div>

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary: 
Model collaboration in language model training can balance different skills by having models work together. The Switch Generation approach involves a switcher LM that alternates between different model versions to generate responses. This method outperforms individual models and other collaboration baselines on a wide range of tasks. Switch Generation improves model performance by 12.9% on average. The approach allows for the discovery of compositional skills that can solve challenging problems and enables generalization to unseen models and tasks. It also leverages by-products from expensive training pipelines, reducing waste and maximizing the use of resources. <div>
arXiv:2510.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to ``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks, reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that are otherwise discarded.

Summary: 
Fine-tuning strategies are explored to improve the faithfulness of abstractive summarization generated by large language models (LLMs). Existing mitigation techniques for unfaithful summaries are insufficient, prompting the investigation of new methods. The study introduces a dataset comprising faithful and unfaithful summaries with span-level annotations. Three fine-tuning techniques - gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation - are evaluated to enhance model faithfulness. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of all three approaches, with unlikelihood training proving to be the most successful. By leveraging span-level annotations to identify and address hallucinations in LLM-generated summaries, the study showcases the potential for improving the quality and accuracy of abstractive summarization outputs. <div>
arXiv:2510.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries, introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the detection of hateful memes, emphasizing the importance of understanding what makes a meme hateful. It highlights two key features of hateful memes: the presence of a presupposed context and the expression of false claims. To address this, the authors propose the SHIELD framework, which combines the PCM model for capturing contextual information and the FACT module for identifying false claims using external knowledge and cross-modal reference graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that SHIELD outperforms existing methods in detecting hateful memes across various datasets and metrics. Additionally, the framework shows versatility in tasks such as fake news detection. <div>
arXiv:2510.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate, causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of \textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM} for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims, we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce \textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

Summary:  
Tokenization is a crucial step in large language models (LLMs), but current metrics like fertility do not fully capture how vocabularies are distributed across languages and domains. This study analyzed six tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, revealing stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, and domain-insensitive results. The proposed Single Token Retention Rate (STRR) measures the proportion of words preserved as single tokens, providing insights into language prioritization and fairness. Results show systematic favoritism towards English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi. STRR complements fertility metrics and offers guidelines for more equitable multilingual tokenizer design. <div>

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models (LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word), captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a unified framework for deliberative tree search in Large Language Models, addressing the ambiguity regarding the role of the reward signal. The framework deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: Search Mechanism, Reward Formulation, and Transition Function. It distinguishes between transient Search Guidance for Test-Time Scaling and durable Parametric Reward Modeling for Self-Improvement. A component-centric taxonomy is presented, synthesizing the state-of-the-art and proposing a research roadmap for creating autonomous, self-improving agents systematically. <div>

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model (LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers: \textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the \emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

<div> Keywords: Machine Translation, MT evaluation, MT literacy, fluency errors, adequacy errors <br />
Summary: <br />
The study aims to understand how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect Machine Translation (MT) in real-world applications. Conducted in a public museum with 452 participants, the research investigates the impact of fluency and adequacy errors on bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during casual use. Findings indicate that non-bilingual users tend to over-rely on MT due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternative options. However, experiencing the impact of errors can prompt users to reassess their future reliance on MT. The study underscores the importance of MT evaluation and Natural Language Processing (NLP) explanation techniques in enhancing MT quality and promoting MT literacy among users. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

<div> Keywords: Speech-to-speech translation, Multi-token prediction, Information density, Hidden representation, S2UT models

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for speech-to-speech translation by incorporating multi-token prediction (MTP) loss into the process. This new method aims to improve the density of semantic information in the translation by predicting multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thus capturing more complete semantics. Initial implementations of MTP focused on the final layer, but the authors propose a new MTP-S2UT loss that applies the MTP loss to hidden representations at the stage where CTC loss is computed. Experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently improves the quality of S2UT translations, with MTP-S2UT yielding the best performance. This advancement in information enrichment allows for earlier and more effective enhancement of hidden representations, leading to more accurate and dense semantic translations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late. We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

Summary:
The article introduces a new search agent, ExpandSearch, that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to enhance query expansion for multi-hop question-answering tasks. By incorporating a pre-trained squeezer model to assist in understanding retrieved documents, the search agent can focus on generating effective queries for improved retrieval recall. Experimental results across seven QA benchmarks show that ExpandSearch achieves a 4.4% average improvement over existing baselines, particularly excelling in tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation for multi-hop reasoning. This approach demonstrates that even a smaller-scale 3B LLM can effectively enhance search capabilities and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in complex QA tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason, search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks. To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

Summary:
Long Chain-of-Thought prompting for structured inference with large language models has revealed a vulnerability known as Path Drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate from aligned paths, violating safety constraints. Three triggers of Path Drift were identified: goal-driven reasoning delays, ethical evaporation bypasses alignment checkpoints, and condition chain escalation leads to unsafe completions. A Path Drift Induction Framework was introduced to address these triggers, reducing refusal rates. A path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution correction and reflective safety cues is proposed to mitigate risks. The study underscores the importance of trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form reasoning beyond token-level alignment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming, and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates, while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks, we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

Summary:
This study explores the use of compact encoders for medical abstract classification, addressing the challenges of deploying large language models in health settings with strict constraints. The researchers fine-tuned BERT base and DistilBERT using different loss functions and found that DistilBERT with plain cross-entropy performed best on the test set while requiring fewer parameters than BERT base. The study includes accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1 metrics, as well as confusion analyses to identify error patterns. The results suggest starting with a compact encoder and cross-entropy for efficient deployment, followed by calibration and task-specific optimizations before considering heavier models. This approach offers a practical default for leveraging language models in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1, release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before moving to heavier models.

<div> Framework, Human performance, Text embeddings, Model evaluation, Benchmark <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces HUME, a Human Evaluation Framework for Text Embeddings, to compare human and model performance on embedding tasks. Human performance is measured across 16 datasets covering tasks like reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity in various languages. The study finds that humans achieve an average performance of 77.6%, slightly below the best model's 80.1%. Model performance varies significantly across different datasets, with some reaching near-optimal performance and others struggling, especially in low-resource languages. The research provides insights into task difficulty patterns, highlights dataset issues, and underscores the importance of considering human performance in evaluating text embedding models. The framework aims to enhance the interpretability of model scores, inform model development, and improve benchmarking in the field of text embeddings. <div>

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However, such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages. Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset, and leaderboard are publicly available at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.

Summary:<br /><br />Deep learning has significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has struggled with interpretability in fields like healthcare and finance. Current NLP models lack the ability to tie predictions to human concepts in an interpretable way. The Concept Language Model Network (CLMN) introduces a novel neural-symbolic framework that maintains both performance and interpretability. By representing concepts as continuous embeddings and using fuzzy-logic reasoning to model concept interactions, CLMN improves explanation quality while achieving higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods. By integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space, CLMN demonstrates the potential for practical and transparent NLP systems in various applications. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Unilaw-R1, a large language model specifically designed for legal reasoning tasks. By utilizing a 7-billion parameter scale, Unilaw-R1 aims to address common challenges in the legal domain such as inadequate legal knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To enhance its capabilities, the model is trained using a two-stage approach that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Additionally, a high-quality dataset called Unilaw-R1-Data containing chain-of-thought samples is created to facilitate training. Evaluations on legal reasoning tasks using Unilaw-R1-Eval benchmark show that Unilaw-R1 outperforms models of similar scales and achieves comparable performance to larger models. Through domain-specific training, Unilaw-R1 demonstrates significant improvements on authoritative benchmarks like LawBench and LexEval, showcasing its effectiveness in legal AI applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

<div> intent-driven, preference optimization, diversity, robustness, alignment
<br />
A-IPO introduces an intention module to infer latent user intentions in prompts and incorporate them into the reward function for better alignment. It enhances preference optimization by considering diverse user intents, leading to a clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses. The model demonstrates improved performance on real-world and adversarial preference alignment benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines in win-rate, response similarity, and defense success rate. By explicitly modeling diverse user intentions,A-IPO promotes pluralistic preference optimization and enhances adversarial robustness in alignment tasks. The empirical evaluation showcases significant improvements across key metrics, including Response-Intention Consistency, Intention Consistency Score, and Defense Success Rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of A-IPO in capturing varied user preferences and improving alignment outcomes.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference \textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of $\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

Summary:<br />
- Document summarization requires personalized approaches due to subjectivity. <br />
- A lack of diverse training data hinders personalized summarization model training. <br />
- The PerAugy technique enhances accuracy by perturbing summary content and shuffling trajectories. <br />
- State-of-the-art summarizer frameworks benefit from augmented user-encoders, improving personalization. <br />

arXiv:2510.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However, training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging, particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t. PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics -- $\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity. We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving performance gains.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces REFRAIN, a framework designed to prevent overthinking in large language models (LLMs) by determining when to stop reasoning during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. REFRAIN utilizes a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective but redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB) controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds based on problem difficulty without the need for training or fine-tuning. Testing on various benchmarks and model families shows that REFRAIN reduces token usage by 20-55% while maintaining or even improving accuracy compared to traditional CoT prompting. Ablation and robustness analyses confirm its stability across different models, scorers, and prompt variations. This highlights the significance of knowing when to stop as a practical means of test-time scaling, allowing models to reason effectively without excessive or redundant processing. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps. However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking. REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB) multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling -- enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Large Language Models, Graph-based, Tri-Graph, Passage Retrieval

Summary:
LinearRAG proposes a new framework for improving the retrieval performance of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. It addresses the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing a hierarchical graph structure called Tri-Graph, constructed through lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking. This approach eliminates the need for unstable relation extraction, leading to more reliable graph construction. The LinearRAG framework offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for indexing large-scale, unstructured corpora. In terms of retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy involving relevant entity activation and passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LinearRAG compared to baseline models. Overall, LinearRAG shows promise in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

<div> framework, OCR engines, Large Language Models, document extraction, repetitive document tasks

Summary:
The paper introduces a systematic framework for information extraction from copy-heavy documents, leveraging OCR engines and Large Language Models to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional approaches, the framework strategically selects methods based on document-specific characteristics, leading to significant performance improvements. Evaluation across various extraction paradigms and document formats shows exceptional accuracy and low latency, particularly in table-based extraction methods. The adaptive framework achieves F1=1.0 accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents and F1=0.997 accuracy with 0.6s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR. This approach not only enhances identity extraction tasks but also sets a general principle that repetitive tasks can be optimized by selecting structure-aware methods, transforming computational burdens into opportunities for efficiency improvement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions, our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0 accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction, this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

<div> debiasing framework, large language models, unfairness, prompting strategy, attention heads  
Summary:
Direct-Answer (DA) prompting is compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for eight LLMs, showing a significant reduction in measured unfairness with DA. A token-to-head contribution score is introduced to identify bias heads in LLMs, revealing a causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. DiffHeads, a debiasing framework, is proposed to selectively mask bias heads based on the insights gained. DiffHeads reduces unfairness without compromising model utility, showcasing the effectiveness of addressing bias at the attention head level. <div>
arXiv:2510.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA) prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open- and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues. Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally, building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

<div> Persona vectors, Large Language Models, Creativity, Multi-LLM, Blending

Summary:<br />
The article introduces BILLY, a framework aimed at enhancing large language models' creativity by blending persona vectors within a single model. BILLY eliminates the need for costly multi-LLM systems by integrating diverse perspectives and specialized expertise into the activation space. Through the merging of distinct persona vectors, BILLY guides the model's generation process to produce multi-perspective outputs without explicit communication between models. Experimental results demonstrate that BILLY outperforms single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches while reducing inference time and computational costs significantly. Analyses show that blending persona vectors allows for effective control over different aspects of generation and enhances interpretability. <div>

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks, such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference, enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater interpretability.

Summary:
The survey explores provenance tracking for content generated by large language models (LLMs) in the field of artificial intelligence. It focuses on four dimensions: Model Sourcing, Model Structure Sourcing, Training Data Sourcing, and External Data Sourcing. Model Sourcing distinguishes content generated by LLMs from human-authored content, while Model Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms of the models. Training Data Sourcing traces generated content back to the training data used by the model, while External Data Sourcing identifies external information influencing the model's responses. The survey also introduces a taxonomy categorizing sourcing methods as prior-based or posterior-based approaches. This framework enhances transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness in deploying LLMs for subjective decision-making tasks. <br /><br />Summary: The survey on provenance tracking for content generated by large language models explores dimensions of model and data sourcing, highlighting the importance of traceability in ensuring transparency and accountability in AI deployment. <div>
arXiv:2510.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g., recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning, decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare, finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying external information used to support or influence the responses of model. Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types, which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs. First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then, current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks, providing a solid foundation for future research.

Summary:
A study evaluated large language model-based multi-agent systems in simulating medical consultations by focusing on the reasoning pathways rather than just final-answer accuracy. Through analyzing 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and six multi-agent frameworks, the study identified four dominant failure patterns: flawed consensus due to shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis. The research emphasized the importance of transparent and auditable reasoning processes in the development and deployment of medical AI to ensure clinical and public trust. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway? The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks. Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns: flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Delora, a framework designed to address the issue of noisy labels in training data for large language models. Delora decouples sample selection from model training by using a noisy label detector called clean and noisy LoRA. The clean LoRA memorizes clean data, while the noisy LoRA is trained to memorize mislabeled data, serving as a threshold for selecting clean and noisy samples. This approach aims to break the cycle of suboptimal performance caused by inaccurate initial selections. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Delora in both noisy label detection and text classification. <div>
arXiv:2510.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle, we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

Summary:
Test-time adaptation for language models in specialized domains is crucial due to significant distribution shifts. A new framework, SyTTA, enables on-the-fly model adaptation without additional supervision by utilizing input-side perplexity and output-side predictive entropy as uncertainty signals. SyTTA consistently improves model performance across various architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, showcasing significant gains in agricultural question answering tasks. Notably, SyTTA enhances Rouge-LSum by over 120% on specific benchmarks with minimal additional tokens per query. These results demonstrate the feasibility of effective test-time adaptation for language models without the need for labeled examples, facilitating deployment in expertise-limited domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy, indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query. These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Summary: 
Text representation learning is essential in natural language processing, benefiting search and recommendation systems using unlabeled text data. A new generative framework called Text2Token is introduced, focusing on token target prediction with carefully constructed target token distributions. By analyzing token-alignment properties and identifying key token categories, Text2Token constructs synthetic token targets through data-driven and model-derived methods. Empirical results on the MTEB v2 benchmark show Text2Token's competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art embedder LLM2Vec. The study reveals that vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together during training, shedding light on future research directions.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Summary: 
The article introduces the ImCoref-CeS framework, which combines an enhanced supervised model with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Coreference Resolution (CR) in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The ImCoref model enhances the supervised neural method by introducing a bridging module for long-text encoding, a biaffine scorer for positional information, and a hybrid mention regularization for training efficiency. The framework also incorporates an LLM acting as a Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions and coreference results predicted by ImCoref. Extensive experiments show that ImCoref-CeS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CR tasks. The proposed framework effectively integrates the strengths of supervised neural methods and LLMs, leading to significant performance improvements in coreference resolution.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose \textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method (\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS, which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs), often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first}, aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and \textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I) \ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$. (II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in practical deployment scenarios.

arXiv:2510.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks, and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling, wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However, emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture, and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model, but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB, with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs 176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks -- RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) -- and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation of this critical capability.

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further, AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance, and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

<title>STEAM: A Semantic-Level Knowledge Editing Framework for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10398</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static, reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam} improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at https://github.com/GY-Jeong/STEAM.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings. Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension: fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent. Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

<title>Do Audio LLMs Really LISTEN, or Just Transcribe? Measuring Lexical vs. Acoustic Emotion Cues Reliance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models (LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict. In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management, where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance. We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by 14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA. RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

<title>Steering Over-refusals Towards Safety in Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals -- where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical, and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement / contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce \textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines while preserving legitimate refusals.

<title>End-to-end Speech Recognition with similar length speech and text</title>

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS) was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b) Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the number of frames.

<title>Rethinking LLM Evaluation: Can We Evaluate LLMs with 200x Less Data?</title>

arXiv:2510.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5% using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within 5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction, enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the "digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models (LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts. Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200 semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However, comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor, creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden, emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/qrzou/FML-bench.

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience engagement strategies.

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission, which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering, can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights, we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that, in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale context via efficient post-training.

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our work.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably, AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task. Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage. To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues, thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in 31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise, their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

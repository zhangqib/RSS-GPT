Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web interaction, coding, and autonomous research capabilities. However, current agent systems are either closed-source or heavily reliant on a variety of paid APIs and proprietary tools, limiting accessibility and reproducibility for the research community. In this work, we present \textbf{Cognitive Kernel-Pro}, a fully open-source and (to the maximum extent) free multi-module agent framework designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents. Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our 8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for accessible, high-capability AI agents.

<div> Autonomous driving systems, Vulnerable Road Users, motion retrieval framework, WayMoCo dataset, context-aware, SMPL-based motion sequences

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel context-aware motion retrieval framework aimed at identifying rare human behavior scenarios in driving datasets. By combining Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL)-based motion sequences and video frames in a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language, the method enables scalable retrieval of human behavior and context through text queries. The WayMoCo dataset, an extension of the Waymo Open Dataset, contains labeled motion and scene context descriptions derived from pseudo-ground-truth SMPL sequences and corresponding image data. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval on the WayMoCo dataset. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language. Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval, when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

<div> Keywords: Financial arguments, LLMs, Annotation quality, Gender bias, Inter-annotator agreement <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper evaluates the performance of LLMs in annotating argument quality in financial communications using the FinArgQuality dataset. The study assesses the consistency of LLM-generated annotations compared to human annotations and introduces an adversarial attack to analyze gender bias. Results show that LLM-based annotations have higher inter-annotator agreement than human annotations but still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. The study highlights the importance of bias-aware annotation methodologies for more reliable and cost-effective results. Recommendations are provided for future research to improve annotation quality in financial arguments. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation methodologies.

Summary:<br />
The paper presents a new method for identifying scientific claims, references to scientific studies, and mentions of scientific entities in tweets. It introduces a council debate approach where multiple large language models (LLMs) engage in structured academic discussions to reach a consensus. The study explores three debating methods: single debate, team debate, and council debate, with the council debate model showing the best performance on the development test set. While the method ranked lower in identifying scientific claims and mentions of scientific entities, it excelled in detecting references to scientific studies. This innovative approach highlights the potential of utilizing multiple LLMs in a collaborative setting to enhance the accuracy of scientific web discourse detection.<br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate; and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set. Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

<div> empathy, language models, cognitive empathy, affective empathy, virtual companionship 
Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) excel in cognitive empathy tasks, surpassing even psychology students. However, both small (SLMs) and large language models exhibit lower levels of affective empathy compared to humans. This suggests that while language models can provide effective virtual companionship and personalized emotional support, they may lack a deeper emotional connection with users. The high cognitive empathy of language models enables them to offer objective and consistent emotional support without the risks of emotional fatigue or bias. This study underscores the rapid development of language models in simulating cognitive empathy, highlighting their potential in various applications, such as virtual assistants. <div>
arXiv:2508.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans - including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

Summary: 
This article introduces a method for real-time story identification in news articles. The goal is to assign news articles to specific stories based on events, places, and people mentioned, rather than general topics. The approach combines text representation techniques, clustering algorithms, and online topic modeling methods to extract relevant information for story identification. By using a combination of text representation methods and online topic modeling tools such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust, the system is able to identify and assign articles to stories as they are published online. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of Slovene media articles over a month, showing promising results according to human evaluators. This real-time story identification system has the potential to improve the reading experience on news sites by organizing articles into topical collections. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

Summary: 
TT-XAI is a framework that improves the performance and interpretability of clinical language models when applied to electronic health records. By distilling raw discharge notes into keyword representations, the framework enhances classifier performance and improves local explanation fidelity. Using keyword-guided prompts, TT-XAI generates chain-of-thought clinical explanations that steer large language models to produce concise and clinically relevant reasoning. Evaluation metrics, including deletion-based fidelity and human studies, consistently show that the keyword-augmented method enhances both machine and human interpretability. This approach offers a scalable pathway towards trustworthy and auditable AI in clinical decision support.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

<div> Keywords: hate speech, counter speech, automated detection, transparent method, adjective-based representation 

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel method called the Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM) for automated hate and counter speech recognition. This transparent approach utilizes adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts and leverages large language models (LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation. SCBM outperforms previous black-box models on benchmark datasets from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube, achieving an average macro-F1 score of 0.69. The method provides both local and global interpretability while demonstrating high recognition accuracy. By fusing adjective-based concept representations with transformer embeddings, a performance increase of 1.8% on average across all datasets is observed, showcasing the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed approach. The results indicate that adjective-based concept representations can be effective, compact, and interpretable encodings for hate and counter speech recognition, with potential applications in other NLP tasks. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e., "Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a 1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact, interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition. With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

<div> Evaluation benchmark, Multimodal Large Language Models, continual instruction tuning, forgetting, task order

Summary:
Models with strong general capabilities show better resistance to forgetting during continual learning. Chains of reasoning deteriorate at a slower pace compared to final answers, supporting the hierarchical forgetting hypothesis. The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms is influenced by both model capability and task order. In reinforcement learning scenarios, incorporating KL-divergence constraints aids in maintaining policy stability and helps reduce forgetting. MLLM-CTBench provides a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for continual instruction tuning of MLLMs, offering practical insights for algorithm design and assessment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting. MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Summary:
This study explores the use of a neuroscientific contrast localizer to identify causally relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Through targeted ablations of top-activated units in 11 LLMs and 5 VLMs, the researchers found that low-activation units sometimes had a greater impact on performance than highly activated ones. Additionally, units identified through the mathematical localizer sometimes had a more detrimental effect on ToM tasks than those from the ToM localizer. These results challenge the assumption of causal relevance in contrast-based localizers and suggest the need for more comprehensive stimulus sets to accurately capture task-specific units in LLMs and VLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations, low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture task-specific units.

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B, and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility and future research.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, hallucination detection, ROUGE, human-aligned metrics, evaluation frameworks <br />
Summary: 

Hallucination detection in large language models is a critical issue due to their tendency to generate inaccurate or misleading information. Current methods rely on metrics like ROUGE, which overestimate performance due to high recall but low precision. Human-aligned metrics such as LLM-as-Judge provide more accurate evaluations, showing performance drops of up to 45.9% in existing detection methods. Simple heuristics based on response length can sometimes perform as well as complex techniques, highlighting a flaw in current evaluation practices. The study emphasizes the need for semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks to accurately assess the effectiveness of hallucination detection methods. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability of large language model outputs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

This paper introduces a benchmark called FiqhQA focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) generating Islamic rulings categorized by Sunni schools of thought. The study evaluates LLMs on accuracy and abstinence behavior, showing variations across models, languages, and legal schools. GPT-4o performs best in accuracy, while Gemini and Fanar excel in abstention behavior.

arXiv:2508.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy, Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

<div> benchmark, large language models, Putnam-AXIOM, contamination-resilient test bed, Teacher-Forced Accuracy

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are reaching high accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks but are vulnerable to training-set contamination. A new benchmark called Putnam-AXIOM has been introduced, consisting of 522 university-level problems from the Putnam Mathematical Competition. Additionally, Putnam-AXIOM Variation includes 100 unseen variants of these problems, created by altering variables and constants programmatically. The variation protocol ensures a continuous supply of challenging, unseen instances to test LLMs. Evaluation on the Original set and paired Variations reveals significant drops in accuracy for models, indicating potential memorization issues. The benchmark also introduces Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a metric for assessing reasoning traces and automating proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM provides a rigorous and contamination-resilient framework for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The data and evaluation code are publicly available for further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Educational Settings, CoDAE, Chain-of-Thought Data Augmentation, Pedagogical Guidance 

Summary: 
CoDAE is a framework designed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings. By using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation, real-world dialogues between students and ChatGPT-based tutors are enriched to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned guidance. CoDAE aims to address three key limitations of off-the-shelf LLMs in educational use: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and vulnerability to emotionally manipulative prompts. Through fine-tuning four open-source LLMs on augmented datasets, CoDAE demonstrates improved pedagogical appropriateness, support for reasoning processes, and resistance to premature answer disclosure. The evaluation in simulated educational scenarios shows that LLMs trained with CoDAE provide more effective and appropriate guidance to students, leading to enhanced learning outcomes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However, off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance, better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer disclosure.

arXiv:2508.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO), tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance against existing baselines.

<div> Keywords: language modeling, morphological alignment, tokenization, syntax-based tasks, tokenizer algorithm

Summary:
- The study evaluates language modeling performance in Telugu, Hindi, and English, focusing on morphological alignment and tokenization quality.
- Gold morpheme segmentations of word forms in Telugu are used to assess morphological alignment of tokenizers.
- Better morphological alignment is found to positively correlate with performance in syntax-based tasks like Parts-of-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition.
- The tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs. Unigram) has a more significant impact on downstream performance than morphological alignment alone.
- Naive Unigram tokenizers generally outperform others, but hybrid tokenizers incorporating morphological segmentation show improvement within the BPE framework.
- Intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count and R\'enyi entropy do not show correlation with downstream performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
The study compares language modeling performance in Telugu, Hindi, and English, finding that morphological alignment has a moderate positive correlation with syntax-based task performance. However, the tokenizer algorithm plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance, with Naive Unigram tokenizers generally outperforming others. Hybrid tokenizers incorporating morphological segmentation show improvement within the Byte-pair Encoding framework. Intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count and R\'enyi entropy do not show a clear correlation with performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance, particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi (primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600 derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing. However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs. Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy showed no correlation with downstream performance.

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories, particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

<div> energy, hidden states, large language models, transformers, Jacobian steering
Summary: 
The study focuses on the internal hidden states of large language models during inference, using a physics-based approach. It identifies a constant "energy" quantity that combines the rate of change in hidden states and next-token certainty. The research compares random-weight and pre-trained models, finding that training shifts models into a faster and more decisive regime. A control method called Jacobian steering is introduced, perturbing hidden states minimally to favor a target token. This approach maintains energy and produces high-quality semantic continuations. Viewing transformers through this mechanics lens offers insight into interpretability, anomaly detection, and controlled steering, making powerful models more predictable and aligned with human intent. <div>
arXiv:2508.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20 open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant. Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones, while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more predictable and aligned with human intent.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, reinforcement learning, pluralistic alignment, comparative regression, ethical AI 

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but these methods may not capture diverse user preferences. This study introduces a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative regression to adapt to individual user preferences. By leveraging in-context learning and reasoning grounded in fine-grained attributes, the model compares response options to make aligned choices. The authors propose two steerable pluralistic benchmarks based on existing datasets to evaluate their approach, demonstrating its applicability to value-aligned decision-making and reward modeling. The few-shot comparative regression approach is interpretable and can be used with different attributes and LLMs. The results show that the proposed method outperforms multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods. This research advances ethical AI by providing new insights and directions in pluralistic alignment, aiming to enhance fairness and representativeness in LLM usage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end, we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets, demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces DeCAL, a novel tokenwise compression method utilizing an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising. DeCAL focuses on producing high-quality compressed representations by modifying the encoder to prioritize compression quality over computational resources. Results show that DeCAL can achieve comparable performance to uncompressed data on various downstream tasks such as question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks at 2x compression, with only marginal degradation in performance at higher compression ratios up to 8x. This approach offers significant savings in scenarios where pre-computed dense representations are applicable and has the potential for further enhancements to broaden its applicability. <br />

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more broadly applicable.

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699 autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets, including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy, identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability. Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

arXiv:2508.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment. Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning generalist.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal language models, Mobile-use agents, Intention alignment rate, Human intent, Demonstration learning

Summary:
Integrating multimodal language models with mobile-use agents allows for automation of mobile tasks through human-like interactions. Previous studies focused on explicit human intention flows, neglecting implicit intentions and personal preferences, hindering the creation of personalized mobile-use agents. This work introduces MobileIAR dataset to evaluate the alignment of mobile-use agents with human intent. The IFRAgent framework utilizes Intention Flow Recognition to analyze both explicit and implicit intention flows from human demonstrations. By constructing query-level standard operating procedures and user-level habit repositories, IFRAgent generates personalized queries and SOPs through query rewriting and retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing alignment with human intent. Experimental results show that IFRAgent significantly improves human intention alignment rate and step completion rates compared to baselines. The code for IFRAgent is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MadeAgents/Quick-on-the-Uptake.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query, enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent. Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\% relative improvement). The codes are available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/Quick-on-the-Uptake.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their performance in compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks lags behind fine-tuned models. However, the potential of LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks. However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

Abstract: This paper presents our system built for the WASSA-2024 Cross-lingual Emotion Detection Shared Task. The task consists of two subtasks: first, to assess an emotion label from six possible classes for a given tweet in one of five languages, and second, to predict words triggering the detected emotions in binary and numerical formats. Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning quantized large language models, specifically Orca~2, with low-rank adapters (LoRA) and multilingual Transformer-based models, such as XLM-R and mT5. We enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent performance, ranking 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.

This paper introduces prompt-based methods for aspect-based sentiment analysis and sentiment classification in the Czech language. The researchers utilize sequence-to-sequence models to tackle aspect-based tasks simultaneously and demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-based approaches over traditional fine-tuning methods. Zero-shot and few-shot learning experiments for sentiment classification reveal that prompting leads to significant improvements with limited training data compared to fine-tuning.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors propose an efficient system for text-to-table generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). They address the challenges of handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure, managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. The system leverages novel prompting techniques, breaking down the task into manageable sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback.

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task, requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure, managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table generation datasets available in the public domain.

<title>TopXGen: Topic-Diverse Parallel Data Generation for Low-Resource Machine Translation</title>

<div> Keywords: LLMs, machine translation, in-context learning, low-resource languages, synthetic parallel data <br />
Summary: <br />
- LLMs are effective in machine translation, particularly with in-context learning, but struggle with low-resource languages. 
- Example selection and fine-tuning help, but are limited by dataset quality and diversity. 
- Creating synthetic parallel data is common, with backtranslation being a key method. 
- However, quality target-side texts are not always available for many low-resource languages. 
- The proposed \textsc{TopXGen} approach leverages LLMs' ability to generate high-quality target texts in high-resource languages, which can be backtranslated to produce diverse parallel data for low-resource languages. 
- \textsc{TopXGen} enhances LLM translation performance during fine-tuning and in-context learning. 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at https://github.com/ArmelRandy/topxgen.

Summary: 
Voice-controlled interfaces can benefit older adults in clinical settings, but Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for underrepresented groups such as older Dutch adults remains a challenge. This study evaluates ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults interacting with the Welzijn.AI chatbot. Benchmarking generic multilingual ASR models against models fine-tuned for Dutch spoken by older adults, the study found that generic models outperformed fine-tuned ones, indicating good generalization to realistic datasets. Truncating existing architectures helped balance accuracy-speed trade-off, but some cases showed high Word Error Rate due to hallucinations. The study underscores the potential of generic ASR models in supporting older adults using voice-controlled interfaces like chatbots in geriatric contexts.

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts, with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, text generation, autoregressive, parallel text generation, inference efficiency 

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for text generation in various applications. Most LLMs use autoregressive (AR) generation, which is slow due to its sequential nature. To improve speed and efficiency, researchers are exploring parallel text generation techniques. This survey categorizes methods into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, analyzing their trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency. The study also explores potential combinations with other acceleration strategies. Recent advancements are highlighted, along with identified open challenges and future research directions. Overall, parallel text generation offers a promising approach to enhancing text generation efficiency and performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However, most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency. Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for future research in parallel text generation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces IROTE, a method for stable and transferable trait elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing methods struggle with shallow and unstable stylistic patterns, leading to inconsistent behavior across tasks. IROTE addresses this issue by generating and optimizing a textual self-reflection within prompts to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. By maximizing an information-theoretic objective, IROTE enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and target traits while reducing noisy redundancy. Experimental results show that IROTE-generated self-reflections can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of target traits across diverse tasks, outperforming existing baselines. This method showcases the potential for accurately embodying specific human traits in LLMs without the need for fine-tuning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits (e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge, we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning, leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering, consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

Magical proposes a new architecture for Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) to overcome the limitations of standard LoRA in dealing with heterogeneous data. It utilizes a shared matrix for summarization and multiple isolated matrices for diverse lay-style generation, improving semantic fidelity and generating varied lay styles. Magical introduces a Semantic Invariance Constraint to maintain semantic accuracy and incorporates a Recommendation-guided Switch for adapting to diverse lay styles. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that Magical outperforms other methods while reducing trainable parameters.

arXiv:2508.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically, through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix $A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

The article introduces a benchmark, SciRerankBench, designed to evaluate rerankers in two-stage retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) for scientific question answering. The reranker plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate and relevant answers in the scientific domain. The benchmark includes three types of question-context-answer pairs to assess noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency. Thirteen rerankers across five LLM families are systematically evaluated, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. This benchmark, SciRerankBench, is a valuable tool for scrutinizing the performance of rerankers within RAG-LLMs and guiding future developments in this field. <div>

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this challenging problem domain.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, RAG, Knowledge Graphs, Privacy, Retrieval

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenges of privacy protection in Retrieval-Aware Generation (RAG) systems that integrate external knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed framework, ARoG, introduces relation-centric and structure-oriented abstraction strategies to ensure privacy while improving knowledge retrieval. By converting entities in KGs into high-level concepts and structuring natural language questions into abstract concept paths, ARoG enhances retrieval performance while preventing LLMs from accessing entity semantics. This privacy-protected RAG scenario safeguards sensitive information in unseen entities, enhancing user privacy. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the ARoG framework in maintaining data privacy while achieving strong performance in knowledge retrieval. The innovative strategies in ARoG provide a solution to the privacy risks associated with integrating KGs into LLMs in RAG systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge. RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs, thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1), the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2), the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance. To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness.

Summary:
An automated environment construction pipeline is proposed for efficient reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) focused on tool use. The pipeline includes scenario decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling, and localized deployment. It aims to provide high-quality training environments with measurable feedback and a verifiable reward mechanism. This mechanism evaluates precision and completeness of task execution, integrating seamlessly with standard RL algorithms to enhance model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying scales show improved tool-use performance without compromising general capabilities. The gains are attributed to enhanced context understanding and reasoning, driven by updates to lower-layer MLP parameters in the models. <div>

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling, and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models' tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

Summary: 
Large language models are often trained on outdated data, leading to temporal leakage. To address this issue, a new approach called TiMoE combines GPT-style experts trained on different time slices of a corpus. At inference, TiMoE masks experts with future knowledge relative to the query timestamp, ensuring causal validity. The method outperforms single-period experts and reduces future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Experiments on multiple NLP tasks and a new benchmark called TSQA show the effectiveness of TiMoE in maintaining chronological grounding without sacrificing performance. The modular, time-segmented pre-training coupled with causal routing proves to be a simple yet efficient method for improving the temporal accuracy of large language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time, TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge. We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

<div> Mathematical reasoning, LLMs, evaluation methodology, benchmark dataset, performance degradation

Summary:
This paper introduces a new systematic framework for evaluating the mathematical reasoning robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) by subjecting them to mathematically equivalent but linguistically and parametrically varied problems. The proposed evaluation methodology, showcased through the PutnamGAP benchmark dataset, highlights the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. The study evaluates 18 LLM models, including OpenAI's O3, revealing significant performance degradation on variant problems. O3 scores 49% on original problems, but drops by 4 percentage points on surface variants and 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based variants. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the new evaluation methodology in deepening the understanding of LLM robustness and provide insights for enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<div> Keywords: large language models, ideological biases, decoder-based LLMs, political framing, representational bias

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper discusses the issue of ideological biases in large language models (LLMs), particularly in decoder-based LLMs used in various real-world applications. The authors propose a framework for probing and mitigating biases by analyzing internal model representations, focusing on political and economic dimensions. Using the Political Compass Test (PCT) as a basis, they compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek using contrastive pairs. Through a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline, they identify disparities in model representations linked to political framing. The study reveals that decoder LLMs consistently encode representational bias across different layers. The researchers suggest leveraging steering vector-based mitigation to address this bias effectively. This work provides valuable insights into how political bias manifests in LLMs and presents a systematic approach to debiasing at a deeper level than just adjusting model outputs. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.

arXiv:2508.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety interventions and interpretability research.

<div> Keywords: Quality Assurance, Radiology Reports, Span-level Evaluation, Semantic Difference, Automated Scoring

Summary:
Sqator is an automated system designed for Quality Assurance (QA) of radiology reports written by junior doctors. It utilizes a span-level evaluation approach to analyze semantic differences between junior and senior reports, measuring the importance of revised text spans to determine QA scores. By assessing the importance of these revised spans, Sqator can accurately mark QA scores without the need for intensive labor from senior doctors. The system was evaluated using a dataset of 12,013 radiology reports, demonstrating competitive QA scores and a high level of consistency with senior doctor judgments. Sqator offers a more efficient and reliable method for evaluating the quality of radiology reports, reducing the potential for inaccuracies due to factors such as diagnosis bias or senior doctor ability. 

<br /><br />Summary: Sqator is an automated system for Quality Assurance of radiology reports, utilizing span-level evaluation to analyze semantic differences and determine QA scores based on the importance of revised text spans. Evaluated on a dataset of 12,013 reports, Sqator achieved competitive scores and consistency with senior doctor judgments, offering a more efficient and reliable approach to QA evaluation. <div>

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors. Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias, the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans. Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of 12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Summary: 
The article introduces Culturescope, a mechanistic interpretability-based method that examines how large language models (LLMs) represent cultural knowledge. By using a patching method, Culturescope extracts cultural knowledge to evaluate intrinsic cultural biases in LLMs. The study shows that LLMs encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their internal representations. Low-resource cultures exhibit fewer cultural biases, possibly due to limited training resources. This work lays the groundwork for future research on reducing cultural biases in LLMs and improving their cross-cultural understanding. The experimental results suggest that understanding how LLMs internalize cultural biases can lead to advancements in mitigating biases and enhancing cultural inclusivity in AI technologies.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs' internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap, we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments are publicly available.

<div> Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding, Large Language Models, Latency, Parallelizable Structures, Inference Speed  
Summary:  
Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD) proposes a novel approach to address the inference latency challenges faced by large language models (LLMs). By identifying parallelizable structures within the outputs of autoregressive models, ASPD enables simultaneous decoding of these branches, significantly improving overall inference speed. The framework includes a Hybrid Decoding Engine that seamlessly transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across various tasks demonstrate that ASPD achieves remarkable performance in both effectiveness and efficiency, with up to a 3.19x speedup on the Vicuna Bench. The method maintains high response quality compared to autoregressive models, making it suitable for latency-sensitive applications like AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within 1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

Our work introduces a training pipeline for Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) that effectively combines weakly supervised learning with supervised fine-tuning. The model is first pretrained on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech data encompassing Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. Subsequently, continual supervised fine-tuning is carried out using a mixture of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset. This approach has led to state-of-the-art results, claiming the top position in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. The study demonstrates the success of utilizing weak supervision in conjunction with fine-tuning to conquer data scarcity hurdles and produce high-quality ASR systems for low-resource, dialect-rich languages.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants, industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However, developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich languages.

We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting different trends across models and languages.

Summary:
In this work, a curriculum learning strategy for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through length control is proposed. The method, utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), gradually tightens token budgets during training to encourage models to first explore effective solution strategies before distilling them into more concise reasoning traces. A reward function balances task correctness, length efficiency, and formatting adherence, leading to improved performance on various datasets. Experiments show that curriculum-based training outperforms fixed-budget approaches, achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. The study also highlights the importance of reward weighting and decay schedule design in training efficient reasoning models. The code and checkpoints are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget, achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design, showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at: https://github.com/hammoudhasan/curriculum_grpo.

- Previous work focused on answer correctness and attribution, while recent work looked at faithfulness in the decision-making process. 
- LoDIT is introduced as a method to generate and attribute answers in RAG, using specific token logits during generation to estimate document contributions. 
- The method outperforms state-of-the-art models on a trustworthiness-focused benchmark, Trust-Align.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness. While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps: (1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its robustness in different settings.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RetroAttention, a novel technique for updating Key-Value (KV) caches in Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows for retrospective revision of past attention outputs using new KV entries. This approach addresses the issue of cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding tasks. RetroAttention maintains a lightweight output cache, enabling past queries to access more relevant context efficiently with minimal latency overhead. By continually correcting prior approximations, RetroAttention outperforms current state-of-the-art KV compression methods. Experimental results on long-generation benchmarks demonstrate that RetroAttention increases effective KV exposure by up to 1.6 times and accuracy by up to 21.9%. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache, RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by up to 21.9\%.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered, incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard" for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset, the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant potential for the therapist training scenario.

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive, Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present \textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137 mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions, respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1) Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue quality.

<title>Utilizing Multilingual Encoders to Improve Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09091</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training. While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data. Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews, our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to 71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

<title>Link Prediction for Event Logs in the Process Industry</title>

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference (NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and 27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and connectivity in shift logs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second, most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising 3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity, diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support. When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks, it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant margin.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation, we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration, task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals, nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and 25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective tools to harness them.

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs) in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43 rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class, and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3, and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km (median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70% (Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12 km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance. However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical multimodal research.

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical, AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance, effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation. Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns. These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration, ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it enables a detailed view of the knowledge structures, providing a tool adaptable to other fields.

<title>Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning</title>

arXiv:2508.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the performance.

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii) comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence, struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence, while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in Multimodal Models.

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment tasks.

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets. The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently, test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques: greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.

Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for educational purposes. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.

<title>Designing Memory-Augmented AR Agents for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Personalized Task Assistance</title>

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing, (2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3) Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and (4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

<title>A Dual-Axis Taxonomy of Knowledge Editing for LLMs: From Mechanisms to Functions</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora, but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative -- modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs. external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods, define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude with open challenges and future directions.

<title>Revealing the Role of Audio Channels in ASR Performance Degradation</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages, highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.

<title>E3-Rewrite: Learning to Rewrite SQL for Executability, Equivalence,and Efficiency</title>

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It integrates two core components: a context construction module and a reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks, equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency. Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites, expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

<title>P/D-Device: Disaggregated Large Language Model between Cloud and Devices</title>

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time, essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase. Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT. Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device, and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud throughput increases by up to 15x.

Abstract: Despite attempts to increase gender parity in politics, global efforts have struggled to ensure equal female representation. This is likely tied to implicit gender biases against women in authority. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of gender biases that appear in online political discussion. To this end, we collect 10 million comments on Reddit in conversations about male and female politicians, which enables an exhaustive study of automatic gender bias detection. We address not only misogynistic language, but also other manifestations of bias, like benevolent sexism in the form of seemingly positive sentiment and dominance attributed to female politicians, or differences in descriptor attribution. Finally, we conduct a multi-faceted study of gender bias towards politicians investigating both linguistic and extra-linguistic cues. We assess 5 different types of gender bias, evaluating coverage, combinatorial, nominal, sentimental, and lexical biases extant in social media language and discourse. Overall, we find that, contrary to previous research, coverage and sentiment biases suggest equal public interest in female politicians. Rather than overt hostile or benevolent sexism, the results of the nominal and lexical analyses suggest this interest is not as professional or respectful as that expressed about male politicians. Female politicians are often named by their first names and are described in relation to their body, clothing, or family; this is a treatment that is not similarly extended to men. On the now banned far-right subreddits, this disparity is greatest, though differences in gender biases still appear in the right and left-leaning subreddits. We release the curated dataset to the public for future studies.

This paper explores the application of large language models, specifically transformer-based architectures, for automated information extraction from real estate contracts. We discuss challenges, techniques, and future directions in leveraging these models to improve efficiency and accuracy in real estate contract analysis. We generated synthetic contracts using the real-world transaction dataset, thereby fine-tuning the large-language model and achieving significant metrics improvements and qualitative improvements in information retrieval and reasoning tasks.

<title>From Pixels to Tokens: Revisiting Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) are a significant challenge, i.e., generating objects that are not presented in the visual input, which impairs their reliability. Recent studies often attribute hallucinations to a lack of understanding of visual input, yet ignore a more fundamental issue: the model's inability to effectively extract or decouple visual features. In this paper, we revisit the hallucinations in LVLMs from an architectural perspective, investigating whether the primary cause lies in the visual encoder (feature extraction) or the modal alignment module (feature decoupling). Motivated by our findings on the preliminary investigation, we propose a novel tuning strategy, PATCH, to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. This plug-and-play method can be integrated into various LVLMs, utilizing adaptive virtual tokens to extract object features from bounding boxes, thereby addressing hallucinations caused by insufficient decoupling of visual features. PATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple multi-modal hallucination datasets. We hope this approach provides researchers with deeper insights into the underlying causes of hallucinations in LVLMs, fostering further advancements and innovation in this field.

<title>AdEval: Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation to Mitigate Data Contamination in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on ultra-large-scale corpora, the problem of data contamination is becoming increasingly serious, and there is a risk that static evaluation benchmarks overestimate the performance of LLMs. To address this, this paper proposes a dynamic data evaluation method called AdEval (Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation). AdEval first extracts knowledge points and main ideas from static datasets to achieve dynamic alignment with the core content of static benchmarks, and by avoiding direct reliance on static datasets, it inherently reduces the risk of data contamination from the source. It then obtains background information through online searches to generate detailed descriptions of the knowledge points. Finally, it designs questions based on Bloom's cognitive hierarchy across six dimensions-remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating to enable multi-level cognitive assessment. Additionally, AdEval controls the complexity of dynamically generated datasets through iterative question reconstruction. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that AdEval effectively alleviates the impact of data contamination on evaluation results, solves the problems of insufficient complexity control and single-dimensional evaluation, and improves the fairness, reliability and diversity of LLMs evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, but their massive size and computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing model pruning methods address this issue by removing redundant structures (e.g., elements, channels, layers) from the model. However, these methods employ a heuristic pruning strategy, which leads to suboptimal performance. Besides, they also ignore the data characteristics when pruning the model.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose EvoP, an evolutionary pruning framework for robust LLM inference. EvoP first presents a cluster-based calibration dataset sampling (CCDS) strategy for creating a more diverse calibration dataset. EvoP then introduces an evolutionary pruning pattern searching (EPPS) method to find the optimal pruning pattern. Compared to existing model pruning techniques, EvoP achieves the best performance while maintaining the best efficiency. Experiments across different LLMs and different downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed EvoP, making it a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Language model outputs are not always reliable, thus prompting research into how to adapt model responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include: \emph{abstention}, where models refrain from generating responses when uncertain; and \emph{linguistic calibration}, where models hedge their statements using uncertainty quantifiers. However, abstention can withhold valuable information, while linguistically calibrated responses are often challenging to leverage in downstream tasks. We propose a unified view, Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), which reinterprets linguistic calibration as \emph{answer set prediction}. First we present a framework connecting abstention and linguistic calibration through the lens of linguistic pragmatics. We then describe an implementation of CLC that allows for controlling the level of imprecision in model responses. Results demonstrate our method produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy. Further, our approach enables fine-tuning models to perform uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, offering a controllable balance between factuality and specificity.

Abstract: Pulmonary embolism (PE) registries accelerate practice-improving research but depend on resource-intensive manual abstraction of radiology reports. We evaluated whether openly available large-language models (LLMs) can automate concept extraction from computed-tomography PE (CTPE) reports without sacrificing data quality. Four Llama-3 (L3) variants (3.0 8 B, 3.1 8 B, 3.1 70 B, 3.3 70 B) and two reviewer models Phi-4 (P4) 14 B and Gemma-3 27 B (G3) were tested on 250 dual-annotated CTPE reports each from MIMIC-IV and Duke University. Outcomes were accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) versus a human gold standard across model sizes, temperature settings, and shot counts. Mean accuracy across all concepts increased with scale: 0.83 (L3-0 8 B), 0.91 (L3-1 8 B), and 0.96 for both 70 B variants; P4 14 B achieved 0.98; G3 matched. Accuracy differed by < 0.03 between datasets, underscoring external robustness. In dual-model concordance analysis (L3 70 B + P4 14 B), PE-presence PPV was >= 0.95 and NPV >= 0.98, while location, thrombus burden, right-heart strain, and image-quality artifacts each maintained PPV >= 0.90 and NPV >= 0.95. Fewer than 4% of individual concept annotations were discordant, and complete agreement was observed in more than 75% of reports. G3 performed comparably. LLMs therefore offer a scalable, accurate solution for PE registry abstraction, and a dual-model review workflow can further safeguard data quality with minimal human oversight.

Abstract: The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis, particularly in the United States, leading to significant mortality and societal costs. Social media platforms like Reddit provide vast amounts of unstructured data that offer insights into public perceptions, discussions, and experiences related to opioid use. This study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically Opioid Named Entity Recognition (ONER-2025), to extract actionable information from these platforms. Our research makes four key contributions. First, we created a unique, manually annotated dataset sourced from Reddit, where users share self-reported experiences of opioid use via different administration routes. This dataset contains 331,285 tokens and includes eight major opioid entity categories. Second, we detail our annotation process and guidelines while discussing the challenges of labeling the ONER-2025 dataset. Third, we analyze key linguistic challenges, including slang, ambiguity, fragmented sentences, and emotionally charged language, in opioid discussions. Fourth, we propose a real-time monitoring system to process streaming data from social media, healthcare records, and emergency services to identify overdose events. Using 5-fold cross-validation in 11 experiments, our system integrates machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based language models with advanced contextual embeddings to enhance understanding. Our transformer-based models (bert-base-NER and roberta-base) achieved 97% accuracy and F1-score, outperforming baselines by 10.23% (RF=0.88).

Abstract: Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly assess either text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles -- a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in two formats (text and image), supports adjustable difficulty through prefill ratio control, and offers different evaluation strategies, ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs substantially outperform non-reasoning models by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings highlight limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of LLM-based chatbots, there is a pressing need to evaluate what humans and LLMs can achieve together. However, standard benchmarks, such as MMLU, measure LLM capabilities in isolation (i.e., "AI-alone"). Here, we design and conduct a user study to convert MMLU questions into user-AI conversations, by seeding the user with the question and having them carry out a conversation with the LLM to answer their question. We release ChatBench, a new dataset with AI-alone, user-alone, and user-AI data for 396 questions and two LLMs, including 144K answers and 7,336 user-AI conversations. We find that AI-alone accuracy fails to predict user-AI accuracy, with significant differences across multiple subjects (math, physics, and moral reasoning), and we analyze the user-AI conversations to provide insight into how they diverge from AI-alone benchmarks. Finally, we show that fine-tuning a user simulator on a subset of ChatBench improves its ability to estimate user-AI accuracies, increasing correlation on held-out questions by more than 20 points, creating possibilities for scaling interactive evaluation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the factuality of their responses. However, in practice, these systems often need to handle ambiguous user queries and potentially conflicting information from multiple sources while also suppressing inaccurate information from noisy or irrelevant documents. Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match score). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our analysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing the level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.

<title>Do LLMs Really Forget? Evaluating Unlearning with Knowledge Correlation and Confidence Awareness</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential when employing large language models (LLMs) in high-risk domains such as clinical question answering (QA). In this work, we evaluate uncertainty estimation methods for clinical QA focusing, for the first time, on eleven clinical specialties and six question types, and across ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models). We analyze score-based UQ methods, present a case study introducing a novel lightweight method based on behavioral features derived from reasoning-oriented models, and examine conformal prediction as a complementary set-based approach. Our findings reveal that uncertainty reliability is not a monolithic property, but one that depends on clinical specialty and question type due to shifts in calibration and discrimination. Our results highlight the need to select or ensemble models based on their distinct, complementary strengths and clinical use.

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to clustering algorithms such as $k$-Means, DBSCAN, a combination of HDBSCAN and $k$-NN, and BIRCH. Our method aims to achieve a finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pre-trained multimodal models, including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, ColPali, Gemma3, and InternVL3. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues for future research to understand and organize document collections.

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon reaching the end-of-sequence () token, overlooking the potential learning opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while preserving deployment efficiency.

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation. DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal, glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects, future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with articulatory-acoustic modules.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic, role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q\&amp;A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2\%, safety 54.7\%, effectiveness 62.3\%), with a significant 13.3\% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p $<$ 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.

Abstract: LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that using AIOS can achieve up to 2.1x faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks.

Abstract: The need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology is acute, especially in the underdeveloped regions with limited access to specialists and advanced equipment. Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multi-disease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and underrepresented ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) describes a language model's ability to generate outputs based on a set of input demonstrations and a subsequent query. To understand this remarkable capability, researchers have studied simplified, stylized models. These studies have consistently observed long loss plateaus, during which models exhibit minimal improvement, followed by a sudden, rapid surge of learning. In this work, we reveal that training on multiple diverse ICL tasks simultaneously shortens the loss plateaus, making each task easier to learn. This finding is surprising as it contradicts the natural intuition that the combined complexity of multiple ICL tasks would lengthen the learning process, not shorten it. Our result suggests that the recent success in large-scale training of language models may be attributed not only to the richness of the data at scale but also to the easier optimization (training) induced by the diversity of natural language training data.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have generated both interest and concern about their potential adoption as information sources or communication tools across different domains. In public health, where stakes are high and impacts extend across diverse populations, adopting LLMs poses unique challenges that require thorough evaluation. However, structured approaches for assessing potential risks in public health remain under-explored. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups with public health professionals and individuals with lived experience to unpack their concerns, situated across three distinct and critical public health issues that demand high-quality information: infectious disease prevention (vaccines), chronic and well-being care (opioid use disorder), and community health and safety (intimate partner violence). We synthesize participants' perspectives into a risk taxonomy, identifying and contextualizing the potential harms LLMs may introduce when positioned alongside traditional health communication. This taxonomy highlights four dimensions of risk to individuals, human-centered care, information ecosystem, and technology accountability. For each dimension, we unpack specific risks and offer example reflection questions to help practitioners adopt a risk-reflexive approach. By summarizing distinctive LLM characteristics and linking them to identified risks, we discuss the need to revisit prior mental models of information behaviors and complement evaluations with external validity and domain expertise through lived experience and real-world practices. Together, this work contributes a shared vocabulary and reflection tool for people in both computing and public health to collaboratively anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate risks in deciding when to employ LLM capabilities (or not) and how to mitigate harm.

Abstract: Language models have recently been shown capable of performing regression wherein numeric predictions are represented as decoded strings. In this work, we provide theoretical grounds for this capability and furthermore investigate the utility of causal sequence decoding models as numeric regression heads given any feature representation. We find that, despite being trained in the usual way - for next-token prediction via cross-entropy loss - decoder-based heads are as performant as standard pointwise heads when benchmarked over standard regression tasks, while being flexible enough to capture smooth numeric distributions, such as in the task of density estimation.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent's understanding of the synthetic users' needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes. The proposed framework lays the foundation for efficient development of conversational agents through extensive, realistic, and grounded simulated interactions.

Abstract: Open Semantic Mapping (OSM) is a key technology in robotic perception, combining semantic segmentation and SLAM techniques. This paper introduces a dynamically configurable and highly automated LLM/LVLM-powered pipeline for evaluating OSM solutions called OSMa-Bench (Open Semantic Mapping Benchmark). The study focuses on evaluating state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms under varying indoor lighting conditions, a critical challenge in indoor environments. We introduce a novel dataset with simulated RGB-D sequences and ground truth 3D reconstructions, facilitating the rigorous analysis of mapping performance across different lighting conditions. Through experiments on leading models such as ConceptGraphs, BBQ and OpenScene, we evaluate the semantic fidelity of object recognition and segmentation. Additionally, we introduce a Scene Graph evaluation method to analyze the ability of models to interpret semantic structure. The results provide insights into the robustness of these models, forming future research directions for developing resilient and adaptable robotic systems.

arXiv:2504.06949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed Forgetting Transformer (FoX) incorporates a forget gate into softmax attention and has shown consistently better or on-par performance compared to the standard RoPE-based Transformer. Notably, many attention heads in FoX tend to forget quickly, causing their output at each timestep to rely primarily on local context. Based on this observation, we propose Adaptive Computation Pruning (ACP) for FoX, a method that dynamically prunes computations involving input-output dependencies that are strongly decayed by the forget gate. In particular, our method performs provably safe pruning via a dynamically set pruning threshold that guarantees the pruned attention weights are negligible. We apply ACP to language model pretraining with FoX and show it consistently reduces the number of FLOPs and memory accesses in softmax attention by around 70% across different model sizes and context lengths, resulting in a roughly 50% to 70% reduction in attention runtime (or a 2-3$\times$ speedup) and a roughly 10% to 40% increase in end-to-end training throughput. Furthermore, longer context lengths yield greater computational savings. All these speed improvements are achieved without any performance degradation. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhixuan-lin/forgetting-transformer.

arXiv:2505.21472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve impressive performance on multimodal tasks but often suffer from hallucination, and confidently describe objects or attributes not present in the image. Current training-free interventions struggle to maintain accuracy in open-ended and long-form generation scenarios. We introduce the Confidence-Aware Attention Calibration (CAAC) framework to address this challenge by targeting two key biases: spatial perception bias, which distributes attention disproportionately across image tokens, and modality bias, which shifts focus from visual to textual inputs over time. CAAC employs a two-step approach: Visual-Token Calibration (VTC) to balance attention across visual tokens, and Adaptive Attention Re-Scaling (AAR) to reinforce visual grounding guided by the model's confidence. This confidence-driven adjustment ensures consistent visual alignment during generation. Experiments on CHAIR, AMBER, and POPE benchmarks demonstrate that CAAC outperforms baselines, particularly in long-form generations, effectively reducing hallucination.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts -- where missed cues can stereotype communities and undermine usability. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46, highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, language-specific neurons, multilingual abilities, language arithmetics, neuron steering <br />
Summary: <br />
The study delves into the neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing language-specific neurons in various LLMs across multiple languages. They use the Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE) method to identify these neurons, which tend to cluster in deeper layers with a stronger focus on non-Latin scripts. By employing language arithmetics, the researchers are able to deactivate unwanted languages and activate desired ones, showcasing superior performance compared to simpler replacement methods. These interventions effectively guide model behavior in tasks such as language forcing, translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. The manipulation is particularly effective for high-resource languages and benefits from typological similarity. Furthermore, cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream performance and sheds light on internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection as neurons are gradually deactivated. The research code is publicly available for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing, translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness. We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Language-Neurons-Manipulation.

<div> modeling, prediction, clinical trials, serious adverse events, transfer learning
Summary:<br /><br /> The study evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using data from ClinicalTrials.gov. Two models were developed: a classifier to predict which arm of a trial had a higher proportion of SAEs and a regression model to predict the proportion of SAEs in the control arm. Using a transfer learning approach with pretrained language models, the best model achieved an AUC of 77.6% for predicting higher SAE proportions and an RMSE of 18.6% for predicting SAE proportions in the control arm. A sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction from long trial texts, outperforming direct comparisons.

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical trials could be better designed and monitored. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event (SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analyzed 22,107 two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier predicting whether a greater proportion of participants in an experimental arm would have SAEs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; AUC) compared to the control arm, and a regression model to predict the proportion of participants with SAEs in the control arms (root mean squared error; RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g., ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with a downstream model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts exceeding localized language model input limits, a sliding window method was developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model (ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC when predicting which trial arm had a higher proportion of SAEs. When predicting SAE proportion in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed direct comparisons. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%, and absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58% across 12 regressors. Discussion: Summary results data from ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilized. Predicted results of publicly reported trials provides an opportunity to identify discrepancies between expected and reported safety results.

Summary: 
The article introduces TextQuests, a benchmark based on interactive fiction games that evaluates AI agents' ability to reason autonomously in complex environments. Unlike existing benchmarks, TextQuests focuses on long-context intrinsic reasoning by precluding the use of external tools. This benchmark challenges AI agents with stateful tasks that require trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. By mirroring real-world challenges, TextQuests aims to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving in exploratory environments. The benchmark is designed to test an agent's ability to operate in environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over long horizons. TextQuests is publicly available at https://textquests.ai. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR, MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash) to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API, Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents (evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework, including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the base corpora.

Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA 3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results, improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings, respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.

Summary: 
The study introduces the concept of CarbonScaling, which extends neural scaling laws to consider both operational and embodied carbon emissions in training large language models (LLMs). It quantitatively connects model accuracy to carbon footprint, revealing a power-law relationship tempered by real-world inefficiencies in carbon scaling. Hardware technology advancements offer emission reductions for smaller to mid-sized models but suffer diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations, particularly critical batch size scaling, are identified as effective strategies for mitigating inefficiencies and reducing the carbon footprint of LLM training. Overall, the study provides insights into training more sustainable and carbon-efficient large language models. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents \textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on the importance of tokenization in Large Language Model (LLM) development, particularly in multilingual contexts like Indic scripts. The research analyzes the relationship between vocabulary size, pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition in terms of token-to-word efficiency and model quality. By experimenting with Indic scripts, which have high script diversity and orthographic complexity, the study proposes a novel data composition algorithm for tokenizer training that significantly improves model performance. The findings highlight the critical role of tokenization in building efficient and scalable multilingual LLMs, alongside model architecture and training objectives. The proposed tokenizer achieved over 40% improvement in average token-to-word ratio compared to state-of-the-art multilingual Indic models, leading to enhanced model performance and faster inference speed. <div>
arXiv:2508.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied, tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size, pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models. This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable multilingual LLMs

Summary: <br />
The article introduces AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning with Text (AEALT) as a framework that incorporates dimension reduction into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach utilizes a supervised augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors from text embeddings extracted from documents. By capturing the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms traditional deep-learning methods that solely rely on raw embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including classification, anomaly detection, and prediction tasks, validate the effectiveness and versatility of AEALT. The numerical results demonstrate significant improvements over both raw embeddings and standard dimension reduction techniques. AEALT offers a promising solution to enhance efficiency and reduce computational costs in downstream tasks utilizing LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data, producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors. By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

Summary:
Existing research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on their ability to generate questions rather than providing adaptive instructional guidance. This study introduces a benchmark called GuideEval that evaluates pedagogical guidance based on learner states in three phases: Perception, Orchestration, and Elicitation. The empirical findings show that current LLMs struggle to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners are confused or need redirection. Additionally, a behavior-guided fine-tuning strategy is introduced, utilizing behavior-prompted instructional dialogues to improve guidance performance. By emphasizing learner-centered interaction, this study advocates for a more dialogic approach to evaluating Socratic LLMs.

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners' understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states; (2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation, stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues, significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

This article introduces a new method for post-hoc unlearning in large language models, allowing specific domains of knowledge to be removed without full retraining. The key bottleneck in unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget sets, which guide the model to forget the target domain. The proposed method generates high-quality forget sets using language models themselves, by synthesizing textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline. Experiments on unlearning biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels show that the synthetic datasets outperform baseline alternatives and rival expert-curated ones.

Synthetic datasets offer a scalable and practical approach to unlearning in various domains without manual intervention.

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline, requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity, which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/xyzhu123/Synthetic_Textbook.

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness: dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp, employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives, enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves 3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context engineering in Deep-Research system.

<div> merge list, tokenization, BPE, language model, privacy-preserving

Summary:
The paper explores the impact of using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization on downstream language model tasks. While recent research has highlighted potential security risks in BPE due to the merge list, this study focuses on BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this list. Two categories of inference schemes are investigated: deviations from the merge list and merge-list-free algorithms. Results show that targeted deviations can significantly decrease model performance, while non-targeted merge-list-free algorithms have minimal impact. This suggests the possibility of simpler and more privacy-preserving tokenization methods that do not compromise model performance. These findings open up avenues for developing secure tokenization schemes for language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization compresses text by pairing a learned token vocabulary with a detailed merge list. Recent work has shown that this merge list exposes a potential attack surface for extracting information about language model's training data. In this paper, we explore the downstream impact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all, and hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this question, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ from BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists including random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving deletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not depend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or exactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like accuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation reveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant degradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free inference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is often much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and potentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not catastrophically compromise model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across diverse domains, raising concerns about their limitations and potential risks. In this study, we investigate two types of bias that LLMs may display: stereotype bias and deviation bias. Stereotype bias refers to when LLMs consistently associate specific traits with a particular demographic group. Deviation bias reflects the disparity between the demographic distributions extracted from LLM-generated content and real-world demographic distributions. By asking four advanced LLMs to generate profiles of individuals, we examine the associations between each demographic group and attributes such as political affiliation, religion, and sexual orientation. Our experimental results show that all examined LLMs exhibit both significant stereotype bias and deviation bias towards multiple groups. Our findings uncover the biases that occur when LLMs infer user attributes and shed light on the potential harms of LLM-generated outputs.

Summary:
- Current research explores the translation quality of large language models (LLMs) in the context of Kanuri, a language lacking digital resources. 
- Two datasets focusing on health and general terminology were designed to evaluate LLM translation effectiveness using various language resources. 
- Parallel sentences were found to be the most effective data source, outperforming grammar and dictionaries in both human evaluations and automatic metrics. 
- Incorporating grammar improved translation quality over zero-shot translation but was not sufficient on its own. 
- Human evaluations revealed that LLMs excelled in accuracy but struggled with fluency in domain-specific translation tasks. 
- The study highlights the importance of multidimensional evaluation metrics to assess LLM translation performance accurately. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art models demonstrate capacity to leverage in-context learning to translate into previously unseen language contexts. Tanzer et al. [2024] utilize language materials (e.g. a grammar) to improve translation quality for Kalamang using large language models (LLMs). We focus on Kanuri, a language that, despite having substantial speaker population, has minimal digital resources. We design two datasets for evaluation: one focused on health and humanitarian terms, and another containing generalized terminology, investigating how domain-specific tasks impact LLM translation quality.
  By providing different combinations of language resources (grammar, dictionary, and parallel sentences), we measure LLM translation effectiveness, comparing results to native speaker translations and human linguist performance. We evaluate using both automatic metrics and native speaker assessments of fluency and accuracy.
  Results demonstrate that parallel sentences remain the most effective data source, outperforming other methods in human evaluations and automatic metrics. While incorporating grammar improves over zero-shot translation, it fails as an effective standalone data source. Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve accuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).
  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from multidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar alone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for effective domain-specific translation.

Summary: 
The study explores the impact of chain-of-thought prompting on fairness in language models. Researchers investigate whether biased models exhibit biased thoughts before generating output. Analysis was conducted on five popular language models using fairness metrics to measure 11 different biases. Results indicate that there is a low correlation between bias in the thinking process and biased output, with a correlation of less than 0.6 in most cases. This suggests that, unlike humans, models making biased decisions do not consistently demonstrate biased thoughts. <div>

Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question: \textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.

<div> bias, language models, evaluations, self-bias, performance 

Summary:
The study focuses on self-bias in large language models (LLMs) acting as judges. It addresses the issue of LLMs providing overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, known as self-bias, which can distort evaluations. A statistical framework is proposed to identify and estimate self-bias by comparing scoring distributions of LLM outputs. The method accounts for model quality differences and ensures genuine performance variations are not mistaken for bias. An empirical analysis on a large dataset reveals models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibit self-bias and family-bias by rating outputs from the same model family higher. The findings emphasize potential biases when using LLM judges and provide guidance to mitigate biases in automated evaluations. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated. Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs) consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases when interpreting automated evaluations.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a framework to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American Incarceration Oral History using large language models (LLMs). The study involves expert annotation, prompt design, and evaluation of LLMs like ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. The authors labeled sentences from narrators, achieving high accuracy in semantic classification with ChatGPT leading and Llama for sentiment analysis. The best prompt configurations were applied to annotate a large collection of interviews in the JAIOH archive. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in analyzing oral history archives when guided by well-designed prompts. The study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical recommendations for utilizing LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By combining archival ethics with NLP techniques, this work contributes to the responsible integration of artificial intelligence in digital humanities and preservation of collective memory.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset, evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%), followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities and preservation of collective memory.

<div> Keywords: jailbreaking, large language models, multi-turn conversations, safety threat, benchmarking<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of multi-turn jailbreaking for large language models (LLMs), highlighting the potential dangers of continuous testing on more than just the first-turn conversation. This poses a serious threat as users commonly ask follow-up questions, and initial jailbreaking may lead to consistent irrelevant responses. The authors propose a Multi-Turn Jailbreak Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) to evaluate this setting on various models, aiming to raise awareness about this new vulnerability and urge the community to focus on building safer LLMs. By exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, the study offers insights into enhancing the security of LLMs and deepening our understanding of the risks involved in manipulating these powerful language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June 2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking LLMs.

Summary: 
SEVADE is a novel framework proposed for sarcasm detection in Natural Language Processing. It addresses limitations of existing methods by introducing a dynamic agentive reasoning engine (DARE) that employs specialized agents to deconstruct text and generate a structured reasoning chain. This framework also includes a rationale adjudicator (RA) for final classification, using a decoupled architecture to reduce the risk of hallucination. Experimental results show that SEVADE outperforms existing methods, achieving an average improvement of 6.75% in accuracy and 6.29% in Macro-F1 score on four benchmark datasets. This innovative approach combines multiple agents with linguistic theory, enabling a more thorough analysis of ironic rhetoric and enhancing the reliability of sarcasm detection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with **D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%** in Macro-F1 score.

Summary:
An annotation framework is introduced to improve automated writing evaluation systems for language learning. The framework categorizes errors based on type and generalizability, focusing on learners' knowledge gaps. A dataset of annotated learner errors and feedback comments is collected, with feedback labeled as direct correction or hint. Three methods for generating feedback using large language models are evaluated: keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided. Human teachers assess the systems' outputs for relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. This study aims to provide more targeted feedback to learners by considering specific grammatical patterns and knowledge gaps, ensuring that corrections are not only made but understood for language learning purposes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have contributed to the development of automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems that can correct grammatical errors. However, while these systems are effective at improving text, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct revisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without considering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error type, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically indirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the generation of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models each error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we introduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by connecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this framework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding human-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint. With this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided methods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs). Human teachers examined each system's outputs, assessing them on grounds including relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. We report on the development of the dataset and the comparative performance of the systems investigated.

Summary:
<br />
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in natural language processing, but improving performance relies on large annotated datasets. A new method for automatically aligning labels based on similarity is proposed, combining empirical and semantic similarities and using a pairwise merging strategy. The approach successfully merges three NER datasets and improves performance when integrating a financial domain dataset. This method offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multiple NER corpora. <div>
arXiv:2508.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets. However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source NER corpora.

Abstract: Personal information is abundant on users' devices, from structured data in calendar, shopping records or fitness tools, to unstructured contents in mail and social media posts. This works presents the ReQAP system that supports users with answers for complex questions that involve filters, joins and aggregation over heterogeneous sources. The unique trait of ReQAP is that it recursively decomposes questions and incrementally builds an operator tree for execution. Both the question interpretation and the individual operators make smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the execution tree. Being able to trace answers back to the underlying sources is vital for human comprehensibility and user trust in the system.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework called SBS (Score-Before-Speaking) for persona-based dialogue generation, addressing the challenge of integrating persona fidelity into conversations. Unlike previous methods, SBS combines the learning of responses and their quality into a single step, training a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score during training. By leveraging noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores for response quality, SBS outperforms existing methods for both million and billion-parameter models on benchmark datasets like PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2. Extensive experiments demonstrate that score-conditioned training allows models to better capture a range of persona-consistent dialogues, with ablation studies showing the superiority of including scores in the input prompt during training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Persona-based dialogue generation is an important milestone towards building conversational artificial intelligence. Despite the ever-improving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in conversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing dialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which outperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and billion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of responses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is to train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score during training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores as a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark datasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training allows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent dialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the input prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups.

arXiv:2508.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work, we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3, GPT-4-0613, and LLaMa-3.3. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, with over 16% and 11% F1 score improvements on Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4-0613, respectively. Moreover, SentiDetect also shows greater robustness to paraphrasing, adversarial attacks, and text length variations, outperforming existing detectors in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage retrieval and answer extraction. For passage retrieval, we ensemble fine-tuned Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task, with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of 0.669 for extraction, substantially outperforming previous methods. These results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question answering in specialized domains.

Abstract: 1-bit LLM quantization offers significant advantages in reducing storage and computational costs. However, existing methods typically train 1-bit LLMs from scratch, failing to fully leverage pre-trained models. This results in high training costs and notable accuracy degradation. We identify that the large gap between full precision and 1-bit representations makes direct adaptation difficult. In this paper, we introduce a consistent progressive training for both forward and backward, smoothly converting the floating-point weights into the binarized ones. Additionally, we incorporate binary-aware initialization and dual-scaling compensation to reduce the difficulty of progressive training and improve the performance. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our results show that high-performance 1-bit LLMs can be achieved using pre-trained models, eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch.

<div> method, abstractive summarization, semantic compression, Vec2Summ, generative language model

Summary: 
Vec2Summ is a novel method for abstractive summarization that approaches the task as semantic compression. It represents a document collection using a mean vector in the semantic embedding space to capture the central meaning of the corpus. By performing embedding inversion through a generative language model, Vec2Summ reconstructs fluent summaries. Introducing stochasticity by sampling from a Gaussian distribution around the mean allows for controlled randomness, similar to ensemble learning bagging. This method overcomes limitations of LLM-based summarization by avoiding context-length constraints, enabling interpretable and controllable generation, and scaling efficiently with corpus size. Empirical results demonstrate that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topic-focused and order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with slightly less detailed output. Its potential lies in settings prioritizing scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction.

arXiv:2508.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Vec2Summ, a novel method for abstractive summarization that frames the task as semantic compression. Vec2Summ represents a document collection using a single mean vector in the semantic embedding space, capturing the central meaning of the corpus. To reconstruct fluent summaries, we perform embedding inversion -- decoding this mean vector into natural language using a generative language model. To improve reconstruction quality and capture some degree of topical variability, we introduce stochasticity by sampling from a Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. This approach is loosely analogous to bagging in ensemble learning, where controlled randomness encourages more robust and varied outputs. Vec2Summ addresses key limitations of LLM-based summarization methods. It avoids context-length constraints, enables interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters, and scales efficiently with corpus size -- requiring only $O(d + d^2)$ parameters. Empirical results show that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topically focused, order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with less fine-grained detail. These results underscore Vec2Summ's potential in settings where scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction are prioritized.

To address this gap, we introduce SEADialogues, a culturally grounded dialogue dataset centered on Southeast Asia, a region with over 700 million people and immense cultural diversity. Our dataset features dialogues in eight languages from six Southeast Asian countries, many of which are low-resource despite having sizable speaker populations. To enhance cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset to advance research on culturally aware and human-centric large language models, including conversational dialogue agents.

Abstract: Evaluating social biases in language models (LMs) is crucial for ensuring fairness and minimizing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in AI systems. Existing benchmarks, such as the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ), primarily focus on Western contexts, limiting their applicability to the Indian context. To address this gap, we introduce BharatBBQ, a culturally adapted benchmark designed to assess biases in Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Odia, and Assamese. BharatBBQ covers 13 social categories, including 3 intersectional groups, reflecting prevalent biases in the Indian sociocultural landscape. Our dataset contains 49,108 examples in one language that are expanded using translation and verification to 392,864 examples in eight different languages. We evaluate five multilingual LM families across zero and few-shot settings, analyzing their bias and stereotypical bias scores. Our findings highlight persistent biases across languages and social categories and often amplified biases in Indian languages compared to English, demonstrating the necessity of linguistically and culturally grounded benchmarks for bias evaluation.

<div> Sparse attention, reasoning tasks, LessIsMore, token selection, decoding speed-up <br />
<br />
Summary: LessIsMore is a training-free sparse attention mechanism designed for reasoning tasks that significantly reduces computational overhead compared to traditional large reasoning models. By leveraging global attention patterns and aggregating token selections from local attention heads with recent contextual information, LessIsMore enables unified cross-head token ranking for future decoding layers. This approach improves generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token subsets per head. Evaluation across various reasoning tasks and benchmarks demonstrates that LessIsMore maintains or enhances accuracy while achieving a 1.1x average decoding speed-up compared to full attention. Furthermore, it attends to 2x fewer tokens without any loss in accuracy, resulting in a 1.13x end-to-end speed-up over existing sparse attention methods. <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention. Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss, achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse attention methods.

Summary:
This article discusses the potential biases present in large language models (LLMs) when used in critical social contexts. The study introduces a new benchmark called WinoIdentity, which evaluates intersecting biases across multiple demographic markers within LLMs. By assessing bias through the lens of uncertainty, the authors propose a metric called Coreference Confidence Disparity to measure group (un)fairness. The evaluation of five LLMs reveals significant confidence disparities, particularly for doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly, the study finds that models exhibit decreased coreference confidence even for hegemonic or privileged markers, indicating a potential reliance on memorization rather than logical reasoning. These findings highlight two independent failures in value alignment and validity within LLMs, which could compound to cause social harm. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10 attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns. Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly, coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers, indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social harm.

<div> fairness implications, Automatic Speech Recognition, ASR bias, marginalized linguistic communities, ethical dimensions<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper examines the fairness implications of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems through a philosophical lens. It argues that misrecognition of certain speech varieties by ASR systems is more than a technical issue, but a form of disrespect that perpetuates historical injustices against marginalized linguistic communities. The paper distinguishes between morally neutral classification and harmful discrimination, showing how ASR systems can unintentionally cause harm by consistently misrecognizing non-standard dialects. It identifies three ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from other algorithmic fairness concerns. These dimensions include the temporal burden placed on speakers of non-standard varieties, the disruption of conversational flow, and the connection between speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. The paper concludes that addressing ASR bias requires recognizing diverse speech varieties as legitimate forms of expression deserving of accommodation in technology development. <div>

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification (discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture. The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.

Summary:
SafeGrad introduces a solution to the vulnerability in Fine-tuning-as-a-Service by addressing the sensitivity to harmful examples in fine-tuning datasets. By employing gradient surgery through conflict detection and projection, SafeGrad nullifies harmful gradients to maintain safety alignment while learning user tasks. The method uses a KL-divergence alignment loss to improve robustness and data efficiency by learning the safety profile of the foundation model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SafeGrad is a state-of-the-art defense mechanism, providing robust safety even at high harmful ratios without compromising task performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective. To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without compromising task fidelity.

<div> Keywords: Omni-modal Large Language Models, safety evaluation, cross-modal consistency, benchmarking, vulnerabilities

Summary:
- The article introduces Omni-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the safety of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) with audio-visual inputs.
- The benchmark includes 24 modality combinations and variations, totaling 972 samples each, including dedicated harm cases to assess safety performance.
- Tailored metrics such as Safety-score, Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score), and conditional Attack Success Rate (C-ASR) are proposed to evaluate safety and consistency across modalities.
- Evaluation of 10 OLLMs reveals critical vulnerabilities, with no model excelling in both overall safety and consistency.
- The study highlights weaknesses in safety defenses, especially with complex audio-visual inputs, and identifies models with low scores on specific modalities, emphasizing the need for enhanced OLLM safety measures.

<br /><br />Summary: The Omni-SafetyBench benchmark introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for Omni-modal Large Language Models to assess safety, highlighting vulnerabilities and weaknesses in current models. The proposed metrics aim to measure safety performance and cross-modal consistency, emphasizing the urgent need for improved safety measures in OLLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual and auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to mitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for OLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess safety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first comprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24 modality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated audio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with complex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation, we propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success Rate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and a Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency across modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals critical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and consistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top performer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs, especially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models scoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics highlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for future improvements.

The paper introduces a novel framework, PHG-DIF, for personalized headline generation by addressing the issue of click noise in historical clickstreams. The framework includes dual-stage filtering to eliminate noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and multi-level temporal fusion for dynamic profiling of user interests. The authors also present a new benchmark dataset, DT-PENS, containing user click behavior and annotated personalized headlines. Experiments show that PHG-DIF improves headline quality and outperforms existing methods on DT-PENS. The framework implementation and dataset are available for access.

Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences. In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF). PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our framework implementation and dataset are available at https://github.com/liukejin-up/PHG-DIF.

Summary:

- It introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE) metric to assess lineage quality in terms of structural correctness and semantic fidelity.
- A benchmark of 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world industrial scripts is presented for evaluation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this, a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from 1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace, can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting. This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying schema-aware agents in practical applications.

Summary:
DySK-Attn is a novel framework designed to address the limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming quickly outdated due to their static knowledge. By integrating a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated in real-time, DySK-Attn allows LLMs to efficiently incorporate new knowledge. The framework utilizes a sparse knowledge attention mechanism, enabling the LLM to selectively focus on relevant information from the KG while avoiding the computational costs of dense attention. Through experiments on time-sensitive question-answering tasks, DySK-Attn outperformed existing techniques in both factual accuracy and computational efficiency. This approach provides a scalable solution for keeping LLMs up-to-date with the rapidly changing world.

arXiv:2508.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search, efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the ever-changing world.

Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing. However, applying them to time series forecasting faces challenges due to temporal pattern heterogeneity and modality gaps. This work introduces TALON, a framework that tackles these issues. TALON includes a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that segments time series data for expert modeling and a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns features with LLM representations. Through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, TALON outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of incorporating pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs in adapting LLMs for time series forecasting.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs for time series forecasting.

<br />Summary: 
The article introduces a novel continue pretraining strategy named Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to improve the performance of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) on social media tasks like rumor detection. By predicting root, branch, and parent relations between posts, PEP captures interactions of stance and sentiment important for detecting rumors. The authors also release a large-scale Twitter corpus, TwitterCorpus, and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with propagation structures. Using these resources and the PEP strategy, they train a Twitter-specific PLM called SoLM. Experimental results show that PEP significantly enhances rumor detection performance, even in few-shot scenarios, outperforming existing methods on multiple datasets. SoLM alone achieves competitive results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the strategy in learning post interaction features. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus: TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results, highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post interaction features.

Summary:
The study explores the interpretability of neural networks in predicting lexical stress, focusing on English disyllabic words. Multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models achieved high accuracy in predicting stress positions from spectrographic representations. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) analysis revealed that stressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels, played a crucial role in predictions. The classifiers also considered information throughout the word, indicating a distributed cue acquisition capability. A feature-specific relevance analysis highlighted the influence of stressed vowel formants, pitch, and third formant on the best-performing classifier. These findings demonstrate the deep learning model's proficiency in extracting stress cues from natural speech data, advancing traditional phonetic research that typically relies on controlled stimuli.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs (PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

Summary: 
Knowledge distillation has been effectively utilized in Continual Learning Named Entity Recognition tasks, using a teacher model to distill old-class entities from new-class data to prevent forgetting. In Few-Shot CLNER tasks, limited new-class entities pose a challenge in model generalization during inference, leading to the Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. To address this, a prompt tuning paradigm called Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning (APT) bridges pre-training and fine-tuning for improved few-shot performance. Additionally, Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) are integrated to provide replay samples from previous tasks, tackling the distillation dilemma and promoting in-context learning.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has been successfully applied to Continual Learning Named Entity Recognition (CLNER) tasks, by using a teacher model trained on old-class data to distill old-class entities present in new-class data as a form of regularization, thereby avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, in Few-Shot CLNER (FS-CLNER) tasks, the scarcity of new-class entities makes it difficult for the trained model to generalize during inference. More critically, the lack of old-class entity information hinders the distillation of old knowledge, causing the model to fall into what we refer to as the Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. In this work, we address the above challenges through a prompt tuning paradigm and memory demonstration template strategy. Specifically, we designed an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning (APT) paradigm to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, thereby enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) into each training instance to provide replay samples from previous tasks, which not only avoids the Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma but also promotes in-context learning. Experiments show that our approach achieves competitive performances on FS-CLNER.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents an extension of the 2D dynamic articulatory model DYNARTmo by incorporating a 3D representation of the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from tongue contours. The model includes two dome geometries for lateral curvature variation and calculates lateral contact points for different tongue positions, enabling electropalatography-like visualizations. The enhanced model offers synchronized sagittal, glottal, and palatal views for static and dynamic articulation displays, beneficial for speech science education and therapy. Future work aims to add a facial view and implement articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis for a more realistic model evaluation. <div>

Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the two-dimensional dynamic articulatory model DYNARTmo by integrating an internal three-dimensional representation of the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal tongue contours. Two alternative dome geometries - a half-ellipse and a cosine based profile - are implemented to model lateral curvature in the coronal plane. Using these geometries, lateral contact points are analytically computed for each anterior-posterior position, enabling the generation of electropalatography-like visualizations within the 2D+ framework. The enhanced model supports three synchronized views (sagittal, glottal, and palatal) for static and dynamic (animated) articulation displays, suitable for speech science education and speech therapy. Future work includes adding a facial (lip) view and implementing articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis to quantitatively evaluate model realism.

<div> Keywords: Speech language models, Empathetic reasoning, Paralinguistic cues, Contextual understanding, Training data<br />
Summary:<br />
- The study addresses the limitations of current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) in empathetic reasoning due to the lack of training datasets incorporating paralinguistic cues.
- Two approaches are proposed to enhance contextual paralinguistic understanding in model training: an explicit method providing paralinguistic metadata directly to the LLM and an implicit method generating novel training QA pairs using emotion annotations alongside speech transcriptions.
- The implicit method significantly improves LLM performance on a human-annotated QA benchmark by 38.41% and achieves a 46.02% improvement when combined with the explicit approach.
- The effectiveness of the proposed methods in enhancing contextual paralinguistic understanding is demonstrated, highlighting the importance of incorporating paralinguistic information in training datasets.
- The reliability of the LLM judge is validated through its correlation with classification metrics, supporting its utility in evaluating model performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41% on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.

Summary:
MAQuA is introduced as an adaptive question-asking framework for mental health screening using large language models. It optimizes diagnostic information by selecting the most informative questions across multiple dimensions. Empirical results show that MAQuA significantly reduces the number of assessment questions needed for stable scores, with reductions ranging from 50-87% compared to random ordering. It performs well across internalizing and externalizing domains, including depression, anxiety, substance use, and eating disorders. Early stopping strategies further reduce patient time and burden. MAQuA is a powerful and efficient tool for interactive mental health screening, enhancing the integration of large language model-based agents into clinical workflows.<br /><br />Summary: MAQuA optimizes mental health screening by selecting informative questions, shows significant reductions in assessment question number, performs well across various domains, and reduces patient burden. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.

<div> Keywords: large language models, moral reasoning processes, trolley problem scenarios, ethical frames, decisional assertiveness

Summary: 
This study evaluates 14 large language models (LLMs) on their moral reasoning abilities across 27 trolley problem scenarios based on ten moral philosophies. The models were tested on decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. While reasoning-enhanced models showed greater decisiveness and structured justifications, they did not always align with human consensus. Models performed best in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, but struggled with kinship, legality, and self-interest frames. Moral prompting serves as a diagnostic tool for uncovering alignment philosophies in LLMs. The study calls for standardized benchmarks to assess not just the decisions of LLMs, but also the how and why behind them. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs, both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism, deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited 3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications, yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones" emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.

<div> Keywords: named entity recognition, specialized texts, architecture, engineering, construction, large language models

Summary: 
ARCE introduces a novel approach for named entity recognition in specialized texts within the architecture, engineering, and construction domain. It addresses the challenges of domain gap and complex terminologies by leveraging large language models. The approach involves generating a corpus of simple explanations, termed Cote, using an LLM and then incrementally pre-training a RoBERTa model with this corpus before fine-tuning for the downstream task. ARCE achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on an AEC dataset with a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. Surprisingly, the study finds that simple explanation-based knowledge is more effective than complex role-based rationales for this task. The publicly available code for ARCE can be accessed at https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ARCE.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking (ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ARCE.

Summary:<br /><br />This study introduces the CCFQA benchmark to evaluate the factuality of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across different languages and modalities, focusing on speech understanding capabilities. Current MLLMs face challenges on the CCFQA benchmark, highlighting the need for improved models in multilingual contexts. The study also presents a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers Question Answering capabilities from English to multilingual Spoken Question Answering tasks. This strategy enables competitive performance with minimal training data, showcasing the potential for enhanced speech understanding in MLLMs. The release of CCFQA dataset and code aims to facilitate the development of more robust and reliable MLLMs with improved speech comprehension capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal \textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages, designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities.

Summary:
ObfusQAte introduces ObfusQA, a novel framework to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with obfuscated questions. The framework includes three obfuscation levels: Named-Entity Indirection, Distractor Indirection, and Contextual Overload. Through these obfuscation techniques, LLMs are tested for their robustness and adaptability in factual question-answering tasks. The study reveals that LLMs often struggle or produce inaccurate responses when presented with nuanced variations in questions. The ObfusQA framework provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLM performance across multiple dimensions. The findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in understanding and responding to obfuscated questions, suggesting the need for further research in this area. The publicly available ObfusQAte tool aims to stimulate further exploration and improvement in LLM capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and, leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind, framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection, (ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

Summary: 
Participants engaged in code-switching tasks with a chatbot that alternated between Spanish and English. The study explored various code-switching strategies and their effects on participants' enjoyment and success in completing the task. When code-switching was consistent and grammatical, participants had a positive experience and performed well. However, when code-switching was random or involved ungrammatical constructions, such as incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, participants found the task challenging and less enjoyable. These findings highlight the importance of developing advanced multilingual language technology to support meaningful interactions with users. Additionally, the study demonstrated the potential of using chatbots for research on bilingual language use, offering insights into how individuals navigate and adapt to code-switching in conversational settings. <div>
arXiv:2508.07325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and (2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces TurnGuide, a novel approach for improving the conversational abilities of Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) in real-time spoken interactions. FD-SLMs face challenges with degraded conversational abilities in comparison to text conversations due to limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. TurnGuide addresses these challenges by segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating turn-level text guidance before speech output. This approach resolves timing and length issues, enhancing the natural flow of interactions. Experimental results show that TurnGuide significantly improves the semantic coherence and naturalness of speech generated by e2e FD-SLMs. The proposed method enables FD-SLMs to produce meaningful and coherent speech in two-speaker dialogues, enhancing their conversational capabilities for human-like interactions. Demos of the approach are available online, and the code will be made accessible on GitHub. <div>
arXiv:2508.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge -- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues, it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining natural conversational flow.

Summary: 
The article discusses a new approach to enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding long-tail cultural entities and low-resource languages. By leveraging a large knowledge graph from Wikidata, the authors collect images representing culturally significant entities to create a new dataset called CulturalGround. This dataset includes 22 million high-quality visual question answering pairs across 42 countries and 39 languages. They train an open-source MLLM called CulturalPangea on this dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance on culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks. Their approach allows for narrowing the cultural gap in MLLMs and offers a practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages. We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities. CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast, improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting, neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates. Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input, rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths, defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval. These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.

Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting, which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches. Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks to be scaled with QE capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, many bias detection methods have been proposed to determine the level of bias a large language model captures. However, tests to identify which parts of a large language model are responsible for bias towards specific groups remain underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method using topological data analysis to identify which heads in GPT-2 contribute to the misrepresentation of identity groups present in the StereoSet dataset. We find that biases for particular categories, such as gender or profession, are concentrated in attention heads that act as hot spots. The metric we propose can also be used to determine which heads capture bias for a specific group within a bias category, and future work could extend this method to help de-bias large language models.

<title>Word Clouds as Common Voices: LLM-Assisted Visualization of Participant-Weighted Themes in Qualitative Interviews</title>

Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155 transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA, BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency, and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts (``diff clouds'').

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR, covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2) entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization, examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR systems.

Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies. With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners, many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context, and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.

<title>Keyword-Centric Prompting for One-Shot Event Detection with Self-Generated Rationale Enhancements</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07598</link>

Abstract: Although the LLM-based in-context learning (ICL) paradigm has demonstrated considerable success across various natural language processing tasks, it encounters challenges in event detection. This is because LLMs lack an accurate understanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which cannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this paper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the weaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps between input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically, to generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger discrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers (a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let LLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These propose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords and promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot event detection.

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2) integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units, underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models (LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently. When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues, including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable effectiveness in the transductive setting.

<title>What am I missing here?: Evaluating Large Language Models for Masked Sentence Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07702</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models primarily rely on Next Token Prediction (NTP), which predicts the next token in a sequence based on the preceding context. However, NTP's focus on single-token prediction often limits a model's ability to plan ahead or maintain long-range coherence, raising questions about how well LLMs can predict longer contexts, such as full sentences within structured documents. While NTP encourages local fluency, it provides no explicit incentive to ensure global coherence across sentence boundaries-an essential skill for reconstructive or discursive tasks. To investigate this, we evaluate three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) - the task of infilling a randomly removed sentence - from three domains: ROCStories (narrative), Recipe1M (procedural), and Wikipedia (expository). We assess both fidelity (similarity to the original sentence) and cohesiveness (fit within the surrounding context). Our key finding reveals that commercial LLMs, despite their superlative performance in other tasks, are poor at predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains, highlighting a gap in current model capabilities.

<title>Exploring Causal Effect of Social Bias on Faithfulness Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM) to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset (BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.

<title>SASST: Leveraging Syntax-Aware Chunking and LLMs for Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g., noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation tokens or  symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content, with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on CoVoST2 multilingual corpus En-{De, Zh, Ja} demonstrate significant translation quality improvements across languages and validate the effectiveness of syntactic structures in LLM-driven SimulST systems.

<title>Grove MoE: Towards Efficient and Superior MoE LLMs with Adjugate Experts</title>

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE, a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate 3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

<title>Can You Trick the Grader? Adversarial Persuasion of LLM Judges</title>

Abstract: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery, Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably, increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability. Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover, the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

<title>Evaluating Compositional Approaches for Focus and Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of evaluating a compositional approach for Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While quantitative evaluations of compositional and non-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative evaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic expressions representing focus or emphasis such as "it was John who left". We fill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply to FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our compositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of modification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of Universal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing sentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our compositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis methods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our compositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER that uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and modification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates compositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate datasets to evaluate compositionality. In addition, we generalize the results of compositional approaches in SA to compositional approaches in FA.

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance, Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

Abstract: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10 legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capabilities for Czech ABSA remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has received substantial attention in English, yet challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the scarcity of labelled data. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches often rely on external translation tools and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating a small number of target language examples into training. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of adding few-shot target language examples to the training set across four ABSA tasks, six target languages, and two sequence-to-sequence models. We show that adding as few as ten target language examples significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings and achieves a similar effect to constrained decoding in reducing prediction errors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining 1,000 target language examples with English data can even surpass monolingual baselines. These findings offer practical insights for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource and domain-specific settings, as obtaining ten high-quality annotated examples is both feasible and highly effective.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages, 1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges, in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

Abstract: Non-manual signals in sign languages continue to be a challenge for signing avatars. More specifically, emotional content has been difficult to incorporate because of a lack of a standard method of specifying the avatar's emotional state. This paper explores the application of an intuitive two-parameter representation for emotive non-manual signals to the Paula signing avatar that shows promise for facilitating the linguistic specification of emotional facial expressions in a more coherent manner than previous methods. Users can apply these parameters to control Paula's emotional expressions through a textual representation called the EASIER notation. The representation can allow avatars to express more nuanced emotional states using two numerical parameters. It also has the potential to enable more consistent specification of emotional non-manual signals in linguistic annotations which drive signing avatars.

<title>Expert Preference-based Evaluation of Automated Related Work Generation</title>

Abstract: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards. To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences. Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve based on feedback as well.

Abstract: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness, context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language models.

Abstract: Current speech translation systems, while having achieved impressive accuracies, are rather static in their behavior and do not adapt to real-world situations in ways human interpreters do. In order to improve their practical usefulness and enable interpreting-like experiences, a precise understanding of the nature of human interpreting is crucial. To this end, we discuss human interpreting literature from the perspective of the machine translation field, while considering both operational and qualitative aspects. We identify implications for the development of speech translation systems and argue that there is great potential to adopt many human interpreting principles using recent modeling techniques. We hope that our findings provide inspiration for closing the perceived usability gap, and can motivate progress toward true machine interpreting.

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a byproduct when processing an input. A wide variety of SiLMs have been proposed. However, these have typically been evaluated on a relatively small scale, and evaluation of these models has systematic gaps and lacks comparability. In this work, we study three different SiLM architectures using both natural language (English) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions: Structformer (Shen et al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022) and GPST (Hu et al., 2024). We compare them with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations (ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics. We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating basic model properties.

<title>Beyond Ten Turns: Unlocking Long-Horizon Agentic Search with Large-Scale Asynchronous RL</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

Abstract: Metaphor is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that shapes scientific understanding, enabling the communication of complex concepts while potentially constraining paradigmatic thinking. Despite the prevalence of figurative language in scientific discourse, existing metaphor detection resources primarily focus on general-domain text, leaving a critical gap for domain-specific applications. In this paper, we present the Medical Metaphors Corpus (MCC), a comprehensive dataset of 792 annotated scientific conceptual metaphors spanning medical and biological domains. MCC aggregates metaphorical expressions from diverse sources including peer-reviewed literature, news media, social media discourse, and crowdsourced contributions, providing both binary and graded metaphoricity judgments validated through human annotation. Each instance includes source-target conceptual mappings and perceived metaphoricity scores on a 0-7 scale, establishing the first annotated resource for computational scientific metaphor research. Our evaluation demonstrates that state-of-the-art language models achieve modest performance on scientific metaphor detection, revealing substantial room for improvement in domain-specific figurative language understanding. MCC enables multiple research applications including metaphor detection benchmarking, quality-aware generation systems, and patient-centered communication tools.

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

<title>Progressive Depth Up-scaling via Optimal Transport</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences. This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance. Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining additional performance gains.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs) often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information within contextual settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900 student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students' lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly available at https://github.com/lukasgehring/Assessing-LLM-Text-Detection-in-Educational-Contexts.

Abstract: Self-supervised models for speech representation learning now see widespread use for their versatility and performance on downstream tasks, but the effect of model architecture on the linguistic information learned in their representations remains under-studied. This study investigates two such models, HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, and minimally compares two of their architectural differences: training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement through multiple training iterations. We find that differences in canonical correlation of hidden representations to word identity, phoneme identity, and speaker identity are explained by training iteration, not training objective. We suggest that future work investigate the reason for the effectiveness of iterative refinement in encoding linguistic information in self-supervised speech representations.

<title>Czech Dataset for Complex Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Tasks</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which consists of 3.1K manually annotated reviews from the restaurant domain. The dataset is built upon the older Czech dataset, which contained only separate labels for the basic ABSA tasks such as aspect term extraction or aspect polarity detection. Unlike its predecessor, our new dataset is specifically designed for more complex tasks, e.g. target-aspect-category detection. These advanced tasks require a unified annotation format, seamlessly linking sentiment elements (labels) together. Our dataset follows the format of the well-known SemEval-2016 datasets. This design choice allows effortless application and evaluation in cross-lingual scenarios, ultimately fostering cross-language comparisons with equivalent counterpart datasets in other languages. The annotation process engaged two trained annotators, yielding an impressive inter-annotator agreement rate of approximately 90%. Additionally, we provide 24M reviews without annotations suitable for unsupervised learning. We present robust monolingual baseline results achieved with various Transformer-based models and insightful error analysis to supplement our contributions. Our code and dataset are freely available for non-commercial research purposes.

<title>Optimal Transport Regularization for Speech Text Alignment in Spoken Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08131</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization. To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization (OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan, then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

<title>Can LLMs Detect Their Confabulations? Estimating Reliability in Uncertainty-Aware Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks, we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

<title>Data-Efficient Biomedical In-Context Learning: A Diversity-Enhanced Submodular Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process: First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples maximizes performance efficiency.

arXiv:2508.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling, thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

Abstract: The Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) 2025 shared task is to model annotator disagreement through soft label distribution prediction and perspectivist evaluation, modeling annotators. We adapt DisCo (Distribution from Context), a neural architecture that jointly models item-level and annotator-level label distributions, and present detailed analysis and improvements. In this paper, we extend the DisCo by incorporating annotator metadata, enhancing input representations, and modifying the loss functions to capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated data.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models. For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust. Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and distributional analysis.

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality, require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content attribution.

<title>Capabilities of GPT-5 on Multimodal Medical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain, recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

<title>Exploring Safety Alignment Evaluation of LLMs in Chinese Mental Health Dialogues via LLM-as-Judge</title>

Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts. Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation. Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress, derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to facilitate further research.

<title>Jinx: Unlimited LLMs for Probing Alignment Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures, evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in language model safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Analyzing literature involves tracking interactions between characters, locations, and themes. Visualization has the potential to facilitate the mapping and analysis of these complex relationships, but capturing structured information from unstructured story data remains a challenge. As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, we see an opportunity to use their text processing and analysis capabilities to augment and reimagine existing storyline visualization techniques. Toward this goal, we introduce an LLM-driven data parsing pipeline that automatically extracts relevant narrative information from novels and scripts. We then apply this pipeline to create Story Ribbons, an interactive visualization system that helps novice and expert literary analysts explore detailed character and theme trajectories at multiple narrative levels. Through pipeline evaluations and user studies with Story Ribbons on 36 literary works, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to streamline narrative visualization creation and reveal new insights about familiar stories. We also describe current limitations of AI-based systems, and interaction motifs designed to address these issues.

<title>Maestro-EVC: Controllable Emotional Voice Conversion Guided by References and Explicit Prosody</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotional voice conversion (EVC) aims to modify the emotional style of speech while preserving its linguistic content. In practical EVC, controllability, the ability to independently control speaker identity and emotional style using distinct references, is crucial. However, existing methods often struggle to fully disentangle these attributes and lack the ability to model fine-grained emotional expressions such as temporal dynamics. We propose Maestro-EVC, a controllable EVC framework that enables independent control of content, speaker identity, and emotion by effectively disentangling each attribute from separate references. We further introduce a temporal emotion representation and an explicit prosody modeling with prosody augmentation to robustly capture and transfer the temporal dynamics of the target emotion, even under prosody-mismatched conditions. Experimental results confirm that Maestro-EVC achieves high-quality, controllable, and emotionally expressive speech synthesis.

<title>AMFT: Aligning LLM Reasoners by Meta-Learning the Optimal Imitation-Exploration Balance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.06944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/hlxtsyj/AMFT.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories, research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208 real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks. Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth, while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis provide the foundation for the next generation of self-improving AI systems and are publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DatasetResearch.

Abstract: Recognizing specific key phrases is an essential task for contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most existing context-biasing approaches have limitations associated with the necessity of additional model training, significantly slow down the decoding process, or constrain the choice of the ASR system type. This paper proposes a universal ASR context-biasing framework that supports all major types: CTC, Transducers, and Attention Encoder-Decoder models. The framework is based on a GPU-accelerated word boosting tree, which enables it to be used in shallow fusion mode for greedy and beam search decoding without noticeable speed degradation, even with a vast number of key phrases (up to 20K items). The obtained results showed high efficiency of the proposed method, surpassing the considered open-source context-biasing approaches in accuracy and decoding speed. Our context-biasing framework is open-sourced as a part of the NeMo toolkit.

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios. Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning, particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the future.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based listwise ranking has shown superior performance in many passage ranking tasks. With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.

Abstract: We introduce SQL-Exchange, a framework for mapping SQL queries across different database schemas by preserving the source query structure while adapting domain-specific elements to align with the target schema. We investigate the conditions under which such mappings are feasible and beneficial, and examine their impact on enhancing the in-context learning performance of text-to-SQL systems as a downstream task. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple model families and benchmark datasets--assessing structural alignment with source queries, execution validity on target databases, and semantic correctness--demonstrates that SQL-Exchange is effective across a wide range of schemas and query types. Our results further show that using mapped queries as in-context examples consistently improves text-to-SQL performance over using queries from the source schema.

<title>Propagation Tree Is Not Deep: Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning Approach for Rumor Detection</title>

Abstract: Rumor detection on social media has become increasingly important. Most existing graph-based models presume rumor propagation trees (RPTs) have deep structures and learn sequential stance features along branches. However, through statistical analysis on real-world datasets, we find RPTs exhibit wide structures, with most nodes being shallow 1-level replies. To focus learning on intensive substructures, we propose Rumor Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning (RAGCL) method with adaptive view augmentation guided by node centralities. We summarize three principles for RPT augmentation: 1) exempt root nodes, 2) retain deep reply nodes, 3) preserve lower-level nodes in deep sections. We employ node dropping, attribute masking and edge dropping with probabilities from centrality-based importance scores to generate views. A graph contrastive objective then learns robust rumor representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate RAGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work reveals the wide-structure nature of RPTs and contributes an effective graph contrastive learning approach tailored for rumor detection through principled adaptive augmentation. The proposed principles and augmentation techniques can potentially benefit other applications involving tree-structured graphs.

Abstract: Current rumor detection methods based on propagation structure learning predominately treat rumor detection as a class-balanced classification task on limited labeled data. However, real-world social media data exhibits an imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts. To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data distributions.

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While beam search improves speech recognition quality over greedy decoding, standard implementations are slow, often sequential, and CPU-bound. To fully leverage modern hardware capabilities, we present a novel open-source FlexCTC toolkit for fully GPU-based beam decoding, designed for Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) models. Developed entirely in Python and PyTorch, it offers a fast, user-friendly, and extensible alternative to traditional C++, CUDA, or WFST-based decoders. The toolkit features a high-performance, fully batched GPU implementation with eliminated CPU-GPU synchronization and minimized kernel launch overhead via CUDA Graphs. It also supports advanced contextualization techniques, including GPU-powered N-gram language model fusion and phrase-level boosting. These features enable accurate and efficient decoding, making them suitable for both research and production use.

Abstract: Personalized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to produce user-tailored responses by incorporating retrieved user profiles alongside the input query. Existing methods primarily focus on improving retrieval and rely on large language models (LLMs) to implicitly integrate the retrieved context with the query. However, such models are often sensitive to retrieval quality and may generate responses that are misaligned with user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose PrLM, a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly reason over retrieved user profiles. Guided by a contrastively trained personalization reward model, PrLM effectively learns from user responses without requiring annotated reasoning paths. Experiments on three personalized text generation datasets show that PrLM outperforms existing methods and remains robust across varying numbers of retrieved profiles and different retrievers.

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across various domains.

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.

Abstract: In this study, we wish to showcase the unique utility of large language models (LLMs) in financial semantic annotation and alpha signal discovery. Leveraging a corpus of company-related tweets, we use an LLM to automatically assign multi-label event categories to high-sentiment-intensity tweets. We align these labeled sentiment signals with forward returns over 1-to-7-day horizons to evaluate their statistical efficacy and market tradability. Our experiments reveal that certain event labels consistently yield negative alpha, with Sharpe ratios as low as -0.38 and information coefficients exceeding 0.05, all statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. This study establishes the feasibility of transforming unstructured social media text into structured, multi-label event variables. A key contribution of this work is its commitment to transparency and reproducibility; all code and methodologies are made publicly available. Our results provide compelling evidence that social media sentiment is a valuable, albeit noisy, signal in financial forecasting and underscore the potential of open-source frameworks to democratize algorithmic trading research.

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.

<title>Democratizing Diplomacy: A Harness for Evaluating Any Large Language Model on Full-Press Diplomacy</title>

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box, local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement and will be open sourced.

<title>Conversational DNA: A New Visual Language for Understanding Dialogue Structure in Human and AI</title>

Abstract: What if the patterns hidden within dialogue reveal more about communication than the words themselves? We introduce Conversational DNA, a novel visual language that treats any dialogue -- whether between humans, between human and AI, or among groups -- as a living system with interpretable structure that can be visualized, compared, and understood. Unlike traditional conversation analysis that reduces rich interaction to statistical summaries, our approach reveals the temporal architecture of dialogue through biological metaphors. Linguistic complexity flows through strand thickness, emotional trajectories cascade through color gradients, conversational relevance forms through connecting elements, and topic coherence maintains structural integrity through helical patterns. Through exploratory analysis of therapeutic conversations and historically significant human-AI dialogues, we demonstrate how this visualization approach reveals interaction patterns that traditional methods miss. Our work contributes a new creative framework for understanding communication that bridges data visualization, human-computer interaction, and the fundamental question of what makes dialogue meaningful in an age where humans increasingly converse with artificial minds.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements over the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

<title>Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\% on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

Abstract: Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications, serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data. Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification, enabling training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or from human feedback.

Abstract: Alignment methodologies have emerged as a critical pathway for enhancing language model alignment capabilities. While SFT (supervised fine-tuning) accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast, RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving 57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution in language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that require careful balancing of multiple, often conflicting, objectives, such as informativeness versus conciseness, or helpfulness versus creativity. However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF, optimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that fails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This limitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making multi-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge this gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and computationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In contrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a closed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO approaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the number of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering direct optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is the number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within milliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto stationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least one other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning with its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to the MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a practical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse human values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI deployments.

Abstract: Automatic transcription of guitar strumming is an underrepresented and challenging task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), particularly for extracting both strumming directions and chord progressions from audio signals. While existing methods show promise, their effectiveness is often hindered by limited datasets. In this work, we extend a multimodal approach to guitar strumming transcription by introducing a novel dataset and a deep learning-based transcription model. We collect 90 min of real-world guitar recordings using an ESP32 smartwatch motion sensor and a structured recording protocol, complemented by a synthetic dataset of 4h of labeled strumming audio. A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model is trained to detect strumming events, classify their direction, and identify the corresponding chords using only microphone audio. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over baseline onset detection algorithms, with a hybrid method combining synthetic and real-world data achieving the highest accuracy for both strumming action detection and chord classification. These results highlight the potential of deep learning for robust guitar strumming transcription and open new avenues for automatic rhythm guitar analysis.

Abstract: Dense Retrieval (DR) models have proven to be effective for Document Retrieval and Information Grounding tasks. Usually, these models are trained and optimized for improving the relevance of top-ranked documents for a given query. Previous work has shown that popular DR models are sensitive to the query and document lexicon: small variations of it may lead to a significant difference in the set of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a variation of the Multi-Negative Ranking loss for training DR that improves the coherence of models in retrieving the same documents with respect to semantically similar queries. The loss penalizes discrepancies between the top-k ranked documents retrieved for diverse but semantic equivalent queries. We conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, MS-MARCO, Natural Questions, BEIR, and TREC DL 19/20. The results show that (i) models optimizes by our loss are subject to lower sensitivity, and, (ii) interestingly, higher accuracy.

Abstract: Automatic transcription of acoustic guitar fingerpicking performances remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled training data and legal constraints connected with musical recordings. This work investigates a procedural data generation pipeline as an alternative to real audio recordings for training transcription models. Our approach synthesizes training data through four stages: knowledge-based fingerpicking tablature composition, MIDI performance rendering, physical modeling using an extended Karplus-Strong algorithm, and audio augmentation including reverb and distortion. We train and evaluate a CRNN-based note-tracking model on both real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating that procedural data can be used to achieve reasonable note-tracking results. Finetuning with a small amount of real data further enhances transcription accuracy, improving over models trained exclusively on real recordings. These results highlight the potential of procedurally generated audio for data-scarce music information retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM) transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime. Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other relevant resources that might not be readily available, preventing some organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. The technique is instantiated in two real-life use cases, based on which numerical experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes in an intra- and inter-organizational setting. The results of the experiments suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective PPM in the target context. With the proposed technique, organizations can benefit from transfer learning in an intra- and inter-organizational setting, where resources like pre-trained models are transferred within and across organizational boundaries.

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have demonstrated strong mathematical and coding abilities, and deep search leverages their reasoning capabilities in challenging information retrieval tasks. Existing deep search works are generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web. However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning (RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains. At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models' current trend consists of using increasingly more extra-data to build the best models as possible. It implies more expensive computational costs and training time, difficulties for deployment, and worries about these models' carbon footprint reveal a critical problem in the future. Against this trend, our goal is to develop NLP models requiring no extra-data and minimizing training time. To do so, in this paper, we explore Markov chain models, Hidden Markov Chain (HMC) and Pairwise Markov Chain (PMC), for NLP segmentation tasks. We apply these models for three classic applications: POS Tagging, Named-Entity-Recognition, and Chunking. We develop an original method to adapt these models for text segmentation's specific challenges to obtain relevant performances with very short training and execution times. PMC achieves equivalent results to those obtained by Conditional Random Fields (CRF), one of the most applied models for these tasks when no extra-data are used. Moreover, PMC has training times 30 times shorter than the CRF ones, which validates this model given our objectives.

<title>How Chinese are Chinese Language Models? The Puzzling Lack of Language Policy in China's LLMs</title>

Abstract: Contemporary language models are increasingly multilingual, but Chinese LLM developers must navigate complex political and business considerations of language diversity. Language policy in China aims at influencing the public discourse and governing a multi-ethnic society, and has gradually transitioned from a pluralist to a more assimilationist approach since 1949. We explore the impact of these influences on current language technology. We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs pre-trained by Chinese companies on 18 languages, spanning a wide range of Chinese, Asian, and Anglo-European languages. Our experiments show Chinese LLMs performance on diverse languages is indistinguishable from international LLMs. Similarly, the models' technical reports also show lack of consideration for pretraining data language coverage except for English and Mandarin Chinese. Examining Chinese AI policy, model experiments, and technical reports, we find no sign of any consistent policy, either for or against, language diversity in China's LLM development. This leaves a puzzling fact that while China regulates both the languages people use daily as well as language model development, they do not seem to have any policy on the languages in language models.

Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.

Abstract: Language models are known to absorb biases from their training data, leading to predictions driven by statistical regularities rather than semantic relevance. We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice preferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our findings show that these biases are predictive of model preference and mirror human test-taking strategies even when chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is used. To address this issue, we introduce Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, APriCoT effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy. Our results suggest that mitigating bias requires a slow thinking process which CoT alone may not provide as it tends to reinforce fast thinking model bias under some prompting methodologies. APriCoT is a step toward developing more robust and fair language models that can think slow.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) often need to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain unfamiliar language skills or adapt to new domains. The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study that bridges the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicates the optimal experimental setup. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark but also in some specific domains including math, coding, and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on a real-life chat system which obtains satisfying performance.

Abstract: The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task asks models to generate natural language descriptions of an audio input. Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods. CLAIR-A is made publicly available at https://github.com/DavidMChan/clair-a.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning. Experimental results across three scenarios, i.e., fictitious unlearning, continual unlearning, and real-world unlearning, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/closer-look-LLM-unlearning.

<title>FlatQuant: Flatness Matters for LLM Quantization</title>

Abstract: Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and acceleration of large language models (LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it is crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error with equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various pre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed weights and activations can still exhibit steep and dispersed distributions. In this paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a new post-training quantization approach that enhances the flatness of weights and activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce runtime overhead of affine transformation, we apply Kronecker product with two lightweight matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single kernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlatQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for quantization. For example, it achieves less than 1\% accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing SpinQuant by 7.5\%. Additionally, it provides up to 2.3x prefill speedup and 1.7x decoding speedup compared to the FP16 model. Code is available at: https://github.com/ruikangliu/FlatQuant.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms, underscores the urgent need for reliable detection systems. This study explores the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect fake news. We employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW), evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the advantage of lower computational requirements.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) demonstrates remarkable performance across tasks in open-domain question-answering. However, traditional search engines may retrieve shallow content, limiting the ability of LLMs to handle complex, multi-layered information. To address it, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website's subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through the horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios.

<title>Softplus Attention with Re-weighting Boosts Length Extrapolation in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to the implementation of self-attention mechanisms. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the length of inference tokens increases. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a new design principle for attention, viewing it as a two-stage process. We first decompose the Softmax operation into a non-linear positivity transformation and an $l_1$-normalisation step, identifying the latter as essential for maintaining model performance. In the first stage, we replace the standard exponential function with the more numerically stable Softplus activation and introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance entropy, creating a novel attention mechanism that outperforms conventional Softmax attention. In the second stage, we introduce a re-weighting mechanism that sharpens the attention distribution, amplifying significant weights while diminishing weaker ones. This enables the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens and fundamentally improves length extrapolation. When combined, this two-stage approach ensures numerical stability and dramatically improves length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at 16$\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging long-context retrieval tasks and standard downstream benchmarks.

<title>Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging</title>

Abstract: Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have set themselves apart with their exceptional performance in complex language modelling tasks. However, these models are also known for their significant computational and storage requirements, primarily due to the quadratic computation complexity of softmax attention. To mitigate this issue, linear attention has been designed to reduce the quadratic space-time complexity that is inherent in standard transformers. In this work, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration of three key components that substantially impact the performance of the Gated Linear Attention module: feature maps, normalization, and the gating mechanism. We developed a feature mapping function to address some crucial issues that previous suggestions overlooked. Then we offered further rationale for the integration of normalization layers to stabilize the training process. Moreover, we explored the saturation phenomenon of the gating mechanism and augmented it with a refining module. We conducted extensive experiments and showed our architecture outperforms previous Gated Linear Attention mechanisms in extensive tasks including training from scratch and post-linearization with continual pre-training.

Abstract: Automatic depression detection provides cues for early clinical intervention by clinicians. Clinical interviews for depression detection involve dialogues centered around multiple themes. Existing studies primarily design end-to-end neural network models to capture the hierarchical structure of clinical interview dialogues. However, these methods exhibit defects in modeling the thematic content of clinical interviews: 1) they fail to capture intra-theme and inter-theme correlation explicitly, and 2) they do not allow clinicians to intervene and focus on themes of interest. To address these issues, this paper introduces an interactive depression detection framework. This framework leverages in-context learning techniques to identify themes in clinical interviews and then models both intra-theme and inter-theme correlation. Additionally, it employs AI-driven feedback to simulate the interests of clinicians, enabling interactive adjustment of theme importance. PDIMC achieves absolute improvements of 35\% and 12\% compared to the state-of-the-art on the depression detection dataset DAIC-WOZ, which demonstrates the effectiveness of modeling theme correlation and incorporating interactive external feedback.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to ask effective questions under uncertainty, making them unreliable in domains where proactive information-gathering is essential for decision-making. We present ALignment via Fine-grained Attributes, (ALFA) a framework that improves LLM question-asking by (i) decomposing the notion of a "good" question into a set of theory-grounded attributes (e.g., clarity, relevance), (ii) controllably synthesizing attribute-specific question variations, and (iii) aligning models via preference-based optimization to explicitly learn to ask better questions along these fine-grained attributes. Focusing on clinical reasoning as a case study, we introduce the MediQ-AskDocs dataset, composed of 17k real-world clinical interactions augmented with 80k attribute-specific preference pairs of follow-up questions, as well as a novel expert-annotated interactive healthcare QA task to evaluate question-asking abilities. Models aligned with ALFA reduce diagnostic errors by 56.6% on MediQ-AskDocs compared to SoTA instruction-tuned LLMs, with a question-level win-rate of 64.4% and strong generalizability. Our findings suggest that explicitly guiding question-asking with structured, fine-grained attributes offers a scalable path to improve LLMs, especially in expert application domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in end-to-end spoken dialogue models (SDMs). In contrast to text-based LLMs, the evaluation framework for SDMs should encompass both cognitive dimensions (e.g., logical reasoning, knowledge) and speech-related aspects (e.g., paralinguistic cues, audio quality). However, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluations for SDMs in speech-to-speech (S2S) scenarios. To address this gap, we propose URO-Bench, an extensive benchmark for SDMs. Notably, URO-Bench is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics. Our benchmark is divided into two difficulty levels: basic track and pro track, each comprising 20 test sets, evaluating the spoken dialogue model's abilities in Understanding, Reasoning, and Oral conversation. Evaluations on our proposed benchmark reveal that current open-source SDMs perform rather well in daily QA tasks, but lag behind their backbone LLMs in terms of instruction-following ability and also suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Their performance in advanced evaluations of paralinguistic information and audio understanding remains subpar, highlighting the need for further research in this direction. We hope that URO-Bench can facilitate the development of spoken dialogue models by providing a multifaceted evaluation of existing models and helping to track progress in this area.

Abstract: Understanding experienced segregation in urban daily life is crucial for addressing societal inequalities and fostering inclusivity. The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.

Abstract: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) tend to show human-like preferences on a number of syntactic phenomena, but the extent to which these are attributable to direct exposure to the phenomena or more general properties of language is unclear. We explore this with the English dative alternation (DO: "gave Y the X" vs. PO: "gave the X to Y"), using a controlled rearing paradigm wherein we iteratively train small LMs on systematically manipulated input. We focus on two properties that affect the choice of alternant: length and animacy. Both properties are directly present in datives but also reflect more global tendencies for shorter elements to precede longer ones and animates to precede inanimates. First, by manipulating and ablating datives for these biases in the input, we show that direct evidence of length and animacy matters, but easy-first preferences persist even without such evidence. Then, using LMs trained on systematically perturbed datasets to manipulate global length effects (re-linearizing sentences globally while preserving dependency structure), we find that dative preferences can emerge from indirect evidence. We conclude that LMs' emergent syntactic preferences come from a mix of direct and indirect sources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge bases yet are limited by static training data, leading to issues such as hallucinations and safety risks. Editing a model's internal knowledge through the locate-and-edit paradigm has proven a cost-effective alternative to retraining, though current unstructured approaches, especially window-based autoregressive methods, often disrupt the causal dependency between early memory updates and later output tokens. In this work, we first theoretically analyze these limitations and then introduce Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing ($\mu$KE), a novel memory update mechanism that preserves such dependencies via a Matryoshka-style objective and adaptive loss coefficients. Empirical evaluations on two models across four benchmarks demonstrate that $\mu$KE improves edit efficacy by up to 12.33% over state-of-the-art methods, and remains robust when applied to diverse formatted edits, underscoring its potential for effective unstructured knowledge editing in LLMs.

Abstract: Subword tokenization requires balancing computational efficiency and vocabulary coverage, which often leads to suboptimal performance on languages and scripts not prioritized during training. We propose to augment pretrained language models with a vocabulary-free encoder that generates input embeddings from text rendered as pixels. Through experiments on English-centric language models, we demonstrate that our approach substantially improves machine translation performance and facilitates effective cross-lingual transfer, outperforming tokenizer-based methods. Furthermore, we find that pixel-based representations outperform byte-level approaches and standard vocabulary expansion. Our approach enhances the multilingual capabilities of monolingual language models without extensive retraining and reduces decoding latency via input compression.

<title>How Post-Training Reshapes LLMs: A Mechanistic View on Knowledge, Truthfulness, Refusal, and Confidence</title>

Abstract: Post-training is essential for the success of large language models (LLMs), transforming pre-trained base models into more useful and aligned post-trained models. While plenty of works have studied post-training algorithms and evaluated post-training models by their outputs, it remains understudied how post-training reshapes LLMs internally. In this paper, we compare base and post-trained LLMs mechanistically from four perspectives to better understand post-training effects. Our findings across model families and datasets reveal that: (1) Post-training does not change the factual knowledge storage locations, and it adapts knowledge representations from the base model while developing new knowledge representations; (2) Both truthfulness and refusal can be represented by vectors in the hidden representation space. The truthfulness direction is highly similar between the base and post-trained model, and it is effectively transferable for interventions; (3) The refusal direction is different between the base and post-trained models, and it shows limited forward transferability; (4) Differences in confidence between the base and post-trained models cannot be attributed to entropy neurons. Our study provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms preserved and altered during post-training, facilitates downstream tasks like model steering, and could potentially benefit future research in interpretability and LLM post-training.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on standard benchmarks, yet they struggle increasingly from mode collapse, the inability to generate diverse and novel outputs. Our work introduces NoveltyBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of language models to produce multiple distinct and high-quality outputs. NoveltyBench utilizes prompts curated to elicit diverse answers and filtered real-world user queries. Evaluating 20 leading language models, we find that current state-of-the-art systems generate significantly less diversity than human writers. Notably, larger models within a family often exhibit less diversity than their smaller counterparts, challenging the notion that capability on standard benchmarks translates directly to generative utility. While prompting strategies like in-context regeneration can elicit diversity, our findings highlight a fundamental lack of distributional diversity in current models, reducing their utility for users seeking varied responses and suggesting the need for new training and evaluation paradigms that prioritize diversity alongside quality.

<title>Do LLMs Understand Your Translations? Evaluating Paragraph-level MT with Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Despite the steady progress in machine translation evaluation, existing automatic metrics struggle to capture how well meaning is preserved beyond sentence boundaries. We posit that reliance on a single intrinsic quality score, trained to mimic human judgments, might be insufficient for evaluating translations of long, complex passages, and a more ``pragmatic'' approach that assesses how accurately key information is conveyed by a translation in context is needed. We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments. Furthermore, the generated questions and answers offer interpretability: empirical analysis shows that they effectively target translation errors identified by experts in evaluated datasets.

<title>QUDsim: Quantifying Discourse Similarities in LLM-Generated Text</title>

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable at various writing tasks, their weakness at generating unique and creative content becomes a major liability. Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize and quantify via a similarity metric. The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a robust approach for tackling LLM tasks that require intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating a final answer. In this paper, we present GreenMind-Medium-14B-R1, the Vietnamese reasoning model inspired by the finetuning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. We also leverage a high-quality Vietnamese synthesized reasoning dataset and design two reward functions to tackle the main limitations of this technique: (i) language mixing, where we explicitly detect the presence of biased language characters during the process of sampling tokens, and (ii) we leverage Sentence Transformer-based models to ensure that the generated reasoning content maintains factual correctness and does not distort the final output. Experimental results on the Vietnamese dataset from the VLSP 2023 Challenge demonstrate that our model outperforms prior works and enhances linguistic consistency in its responses. Furthermore, we extend our evaluation to SeaExam-a multilingual multiple-choice dataset, showing the effectiveness of our reasoning method compared to few-shot prompting techniques.

Abstract: Target-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) remains a significant challenge in the LLM era, where strategic dialogue planning is crucial for directing conversations toward specific targets. However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance toward diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios. Our code and data are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/DiffTOD.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we access information. These models are often tuned to refuse to comply with requests that are considered harmful and to produce responses that better align with the preferences of those who control the models. To understand how this "censorship" works. We use representation engineering techniques to study open-weights safety-tuned models. We present a method for finding a refusal--compliance vector that detects and controls the level of censorship in model outputs. We also analyze recent reasoning LLMs, distilled from DeepSeek-R1, and uncover an additional dimension of censorship through "thought suppression". We show a similar approach can be used to find a vector that suppresses the model's reasoning process, allowing us to remove censorship by applying the negative multiples of this vector.

Abstract: Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct erroneous tokens in sentences. Traditional CSC focuses on equal length correction and uses pretrained language models (PLMs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in identifying and rectifying potential errors, they often struggle with adapting to domain-specific corrections, especially when encountering terminologies in specialized domains. To address domain adaptation, we propose a \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{I}terative \textbf{R}efinement (RAIR) framework. Our approach constructs a retrieval corpus adaptively from domain-specific training data and dictionaries, employing a fine-tuned retriever to ensure that the retriever catches the error correction pattern. We also extend equal-length into variable-length correction scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms current approaches in domain spelling correction and significantly improves the performance of LLMs in variable-length scenarios.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have demonstrated great potential in generating and managing code within complex codebases. In this paper, we introduce WebGen-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to measure an LLM-based agent's ability to create multi-file website codebases from scratch. It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, we construct WebGen-Instruct, a training set consisting of 6,667 website-generation instructions. Training Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct on Bolt.diy trajectories generated from a subset of this training set achieves an accuracy of 38.2\%, surpassing the performance of the best proprietary model.

Abstract: Prompt optimization (PO) provides a practical way to improve response quality when users lack the time or expertise to manually craft effective prompts. Existing methods typically rely on LLMs' self-generation ability to optimize prompts. However, due to limited downward compatibility, the instruction-heavy prompts generated by advanced LLMs can overwhelm lightweight inference models and degrade response quality, while also lacking interpretability due to implicit optimization. In this work, we rethink prompt optimization through the lens of explicit and interpretable design. We first identify a set of model-agnostic prompt quality merits and empirically validate their effectiveness in enhancing prompt and response quality. We then introduce MePO, a merit-guided, locally deployable prompt optimizer trained on our merit-guided prompt preference dataset generated by a lightweight LLM. MePO avoids online optimization, reduces privacy concerns, and, by learning clear, interpretable merits, generalizes effectively to both large-scale and lightweight inference models. Experiments demonstrate that MePO achieves better results across diverse tasks and model types, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-world deployment.The code, model and dataset can be found in https://github.com/MidiyaZhu/MePO

Abstract: Decoding language from the human brain remains a grand challenge for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Current approaches typically rely on unimodal brain representations, neglecting the brain's inherently multimodal processing. Inspired by the brain's associative mechanisms, where viewing an image can evoke related sounds and linguistic representations, we propose a unified framework that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to align brain signals with a shared semantic space encompassing text, images, and audio. A router module dynamically selects and fuses modality-specific brain features according to the characteristics of each stimulus. Experiments on various fMRI datasets with textual, visual, and auditory stimuli demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving an 8.48% improvement on the most commonly used benchmark. We further extend our framework to EEG and MEG data, demonstrating flexibility and robustness across varying temporal and spatial resolutions. To our knowledge, this is the first unified BCI architecture capable of robustly decoding multimodal brain activity across diverse brain signals and stimulus types, offering a flexible solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Existing datasets available for crosslinguistic investigations have tended to focus on large amounts of data for a small group of languages or a small amount of data for a large number of languages. This means that claims based on these datasets are limited in what they reveal about universal properties of the human language faculty. While this has begun to change through the efforts of projects seeking to develop tagged corpora for a large number of languages, such efforts are still constrained by limits on resources. The current paper reports on a large tagged parallel dataset which has been developed to partially address this issue. The taggedPBC contains POS-tagged parallel text data from more than 1,940 languages, representing 155 language families and 78 isolates, dwarfing previously available resources. The accuracy of particular tags in this dataset is shown to correlate well with both existing SOTA taggers for high-resource languages (SpaCy, Trankit) as well as hand-tagged corpora (Universal Dependencies Treebanks). Additionally, a novel measure derived from this dataset, the N1 ratio, correlates with expert determinations of intransitive word order in three typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp) such that a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier trained on this feature can accurately identify basic intransitive word order for languages not in those databases. While much work is still needed to expand and develop this dataset, the taggedPBC is an important step to enable corpus-based crosslinguistic investigations, and is made available for research and collaboration via GitHub.

Abstract: In this work, we evaluate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in building Bayesian Networks (BNs) by approximating domain expert priors. LLMs have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about real-world events remains understudied. We explore utilizing the probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for statements regarding events and their relationships within a BN. Using LLMs in this context allows for the parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific domains. Our experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines, including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from data, especially when data is scarce. Overall, this work introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with real-world data. Additionally, we establish the first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting probabilistic knowledge.

Abstract: Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley, an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction games has created an increasing need for intelligent frameworks where humans can collaborate with AI agents, particularly in post-pandemic contexts with heightened psychological and social pressures. Social deduction games like Werewolf, traditionally played through verbal communication, present an ideal application for Large Language Models (LLMs) given their advanced reasoning and conversational capabilities. Prior studies have shown that LLMs can outperform humans in Werewolf games, but their reliance on external modules introduces latency that left their contribution in academic domain only, and omit such game should be user-facing. We propose \textbf{Verbal Werewolf}, a novel LLM-based Werewolf game system that optimizes two parallel pipelines: gameplay powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and a fine-tuned Text-to-Speech (TTS) module that brings text output to life. Our system operates in near real-time without external decision-making modules, leveraging the enhanced reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs like DeepSeek V3 to create a more engaging and anthropomorphic gaming experience that significantly improves user engagement compared to existing text-only frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale dataset of 20,785 expert-validated multiple-choice Persian medical questions from 14 years of Iranian national medical exams, spanning 23 medical specialties and designed to evaluate LLMs in both Persian and English. We benchmark 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.09% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 34.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, 3-10% of questions can only be answered correctly in Persian due to cultural and clinical contextual cues that are lost in translation. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating bilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset is available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA .

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent large language models (LLMs), empowered by massive parameter scales and pretraining on vast corpora, have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across various tasks. However, their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a flexible Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor, implemented via either in-context learning or lightweight fine-tuning, to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate data management due to their ability to process text from various document formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries. However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA. Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior, particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail at complex multi-hop reasoning because they rely on large language models to implicitly connect information from unstructured document collections. This fundamental limitation stems from treating retrieved passages as independent context rather than recognizing the intricate relationships that enable coherent reasoning chains.
  We introduce SARG (Structure-Augmented Reasoning Generation), a post-retrieval framework that transforms traditional RAG pipelines by materializing explicit reasoning structures. SARG extracts {cause, relation, effect} triples from retrieved documents, constructs domain-adaptive graphs, and performs multi-hop traversal to discover reasoning chains that bridge query concepts to answers. Unlike existing approaches that modify retrieval mechanisms, SARG operates as a plug-and-play reasoning layer compatible with any RAG system.
  Extensive evaluation across diverse domains: general QA, biomedical literature, and financial analysis demonstrates that SARG achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art RAG baselines. Crucially, SARG also provides full reasoning traceability through explicit inference chains, addressing the critical interpretability gap in current RAG systems.
  Our results establish that explicit structural reasoning is not merely beneficial but essential for reliable complex question answering, offering a solution to RAG's implicit reasoning bottleneck.

Abstract: Personalizing language models by effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in the development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graphs, automatically constructed and updated by the LLM itself, and capable of encoding information in multiple formats-including nodes, triplets, higher-order propositions, and episodic traces. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyperedges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle propagation, beam search, and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks-TriviaQA, HotpotQA, and DiaASQ-demonstrating that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT). However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems. CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora, it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

Abstract: We introduce the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus with Reference (MDC-R). MDC-R is a new language resource that supplements the original Minecraft Dialogue Corpus (MDC) with expert annotations of anaphoric and deictic reference. MDC's task-orientated, multi-turn, situated dialogue in a dynamic environment has motivated multiple annotation efforts, owing to the interesting linguistic phenomena that this setting gives rise to. We believe it can serve as a valuable resource when annotated with reference, too. Here, we discuss our method of annotation and the resulting corpus, and provide both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of the data. Furthermore, we carry out a short experiment demonstrating the usefulness of our corpus for referring expression comprehension.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

<title>Large Language Models Don't Make Sense of Word Problems. A Scoping Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective</title>

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, o3, and GPT-5 on 287 word problems shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy, including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems, which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics classrooms.

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system is open-source, with a demo video available.

Abstract: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

<title>Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Models</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE models.

Abstract: A growing stream of research finds that scientific contributions are evaluated differently depending on the gender of the author. In this article, we consider whether gender differences in writing styles - how men and women communicate their work - may contribute to these observed gender gaps. We ground our investigation in a framework for characterizing the linguistic style of written text, with two sets of features - informational (i.e., features that emphasize facts) and involved (i.e., features that emphasize relationships). Using a large sample of academic papers and patents, we find significant differences in writing style by gender, with women using more involved features in their writing. Papers and patents with more involved features also tend to be cited more by women. Our findings suggest that scientific text is not devoid of personal character, which could contribute to bias in evaluation, thereby compromising the norm of universalism as a foundational principle of science.

<title>ComPEFT: Compression for Communicating Parameter Efficient Updates via Sparsification and Quantization</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create "expert" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged, demonstrating remarkable vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a new data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to synthesize and select images from text captions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. We further introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100K curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities.

Abstract: The availability of performant pre-trained models has led to a proliferation of fine-tuned expert models that are specialized to a particular domain or task. Model MoErging methods aim to recycle expert models to create an aggregate system with improved performance or generalization. A key component of MoErging methods is the creation of a router that decides which expert model(s) to use for a particular input or application. The promise, effectiveness, and large design space of MoErging has spurred the development of many new methods over the past few years. This rapid pace of development has made it challenging to compare different MoErging methods, which are rarely compared to one another and are often validated in different experimental setups. To remedy such gaps, we present a comprehensive survey of MoErging methods that includes a novel taxonomy for cataloging key design choices and clarifying suitable applications for each method. Apart from surveying MoErging research, we inventory software tools and applications that make use of MoErging. We additionally discuss related fields of study such as model merging, multitask learning, and mixture-of-experts models. Taken as a whole, our survey provides a unified overview of existing MoErging methods and creates a solid foundation for future work in this burgeoning field.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Multimodal LLMs, evaluating their mathematical reasoning capabilities has become an increasingly important research direction. In particular, visual-textual mathematical reasoning serves as a key indicator of an MLLM's ability to comprehend and solve complex, multi-step quantitative problems. While existing benchmarks such as MathVista and MathVerse have advanced the evaluation of multimodal math proficiency, they primarily rely on digitally rendered content and fall short in capturing the complexity of real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathScape, a novel benchmark focused on assessing MLLMs' reasoning ability in realistic mathematical contexts. MathScape comprises 1,369 high-quality math problems paired with human-captured real-world images, closely reflecting the challenges encountered in practical educational settings. We conduct a thorough multi-dimensional evaluation across nine leading closed-source MLLMs, three open-source MLLMs with over 20 billion parameters, and seven smaller-scale MLLMs. Our results show that even SOTA models struggle with real-world math tasks, lagging behind human performance -- highlighting critical limitations in current model capabilities. Moreover, we find that strong performance on synthetic or digitally rendered images does not guarantee similar effectiveness on real-world tasks. This underscores the necessity of MathScape in the next stage of multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of diffusion-based content generation, significant efforts are being made to unlearn harmful or copyrighted concepts from pretrained diffusion models (DMs) to prevent potential model misuse. However, it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release, malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g., "skin") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., "nudity"), facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4 and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Meta-Unlearning.

<title>Fairness through Difference Awareness: Measuring Desired Group Discrimination in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has conventionally adopted the mathematically convenient perspective of racial color-blindness (i.e., difference unaware treatment). However, we contend that in a range of important settings, group difference awareness matters. For example, differentiating between groups may be necessary in legal contexts (e.g., the U.S. compulsory draft applies to men but not women) and harm assessments (e.g., referring to girls as ``terrorists'' may be less harmful than referring to Muslim people as such). Thus, in contrast to most fairness work, we study fairness through the perspective of treating people differently -- when it is contextually appropriate to. We first introduce an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and correlation (association-based) benchmarks. This distinction is significant because each category requires separate interpretation and mitigation tailored to its specific characteristics. Then, we present a benchmark suite composed of eight different scenarios for a total of 16k questions that enables us to assess difference awareness. Finally, we show results across ten models that demonstrate difference awareness is a distinct dimension to fairness where existing bias mitigation strategies may backfire.

Abstract: Drug optimization has become increasingly crucial in light of fast-mutating virus strains and drug-resistant cancer cells. Nevertheless, it remains challenging as it necessitates retaining the beneficial properties of the original drug while simultaneously enhancing desired attributes beyond its scope. In this work, we aim to tackle this challenge by introducing ScaffoldGPT, a novel Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) designed for drug optimization based on molecular scaffolds. Our work comprises three key components: (1) A three-stage drug optimization approach that integrates pretraining, finetuning, and decoding optimization. (2) A novel two-phase incremental pre-training strategy for scaffold-based drug optimization. (3) A token-level decoding optimization strategy, Top-N, that enabling controlled, reward-guided generation using the pretrained or finetuned GPT. We demonstrate via a comprehensive evaluation on COVID and cancer benchmarks that ScaffoldGPT outperforms the competing baselines in drug optimization benchmarks, while excelling in preserving original functional scaffold and enhancing desired properties.

arXiv:2502.13811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study memory-efficient optimization of neural networks (in particular language models) with linear gradient transformations, where the gradients are linearly mapped to a lower dimensional space than the full parameter space, thus saving memory required for gradient accumulation and optimizer state persistence. The model parameters are updated by first performing an optimization step in the lower dimensional space and then going back into the original parameter space via the linear map's transpose. We show that optimizing the model in this transformed space is equivalent to reparameterizing the original model through a linear adapter that additively modifies the model parameters, and then only optimizing the adapter's parameters. When the transformation is Kronecker-factored, this establishes an equivalence between GaLore and one-sided LoRA. We show that this duality between gradient transformations and adapter-based reparameterizations unifies existing approaches to memory-efficient training and suggests new techniques for improving training efficiency and memory use.

Abstract: We introduce a new approach in which several advanced large language models-specifically GPT-4-0125-preview, Meta-LLAMA-3-70B-Instruct, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.5-Flash-collaborate to both produce and answer intricate, doctoral-level probability problems without relying on any single "correct" reference. Rather than depending on an established ground truth, our investigation focuses on how agreement among diverse models can signal the reliability of their outputs and, by extension, reflect the overall quality of the generated questions. To measure this inter-model alignment, we apply a suite of statistical evaluations, including chi-square tests, Fleiss' Kappa coefficients, and confidence interval calculations, thereby capturing both precision in answers and clarity in question phrasing. Our analysis reveals that Claude and Gemini tend to frame questions more coherently and unambiguously, which is evidenced by their tighter confidence intervals and greater concordance with responding agents. In contrast, LLAMA exhibits wider confidence bands and a lower level of agreement, indicating more variability and reduced consistency in its question formulations. These observations support the notion that a multi-model collaborative strategy not only improves answer dependability but also offers an effective, data-driven mechanism for evaluating and refining question quality when no definitive solution exists. Ultimately, this work delivers actionable insights into enhancing AI-guided reasoning processes through coordinated interactions among heterogeneous language models.

Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.

Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.

<title>Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models on Dynamic Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel on static benchmarks, but their ability as self-learning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. We evaluate three prompting strategies: self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning across dynamic tasks with open-source models. We find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, an overly long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in areas like planning and spatial coordination, suggesting that large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while methods like Chain-of-thought improve multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is effective but limited by reliance on costly, domain-specific supervision. We explore Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), a framework that enables LLMs to learn from intrinsic signals without external rewards or labeled data. We propose Intuitor, an RLIF method that uses a model's own confidence, termed self-certainty, as its sole reward signal. Intuitor replaces external rewards in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with self-certainty scores, enabling fully unsupervised learning. Experiments demonstrate that Intuitor matches GRPO's performance on mathematical benchmarks while achieving superior generalization to out-of-domain tasks like code generation, without requiring gold solutions or test cases. Our findings show that intrinsic model signals can drive effective learning across domains, offering a scalable alternative to RLVR for autonomous AI systems where verifiable rewards are unavailable.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the \texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement in simulation accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality reconstruction remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we identify and formalize three potential paradigms for missing modality reconstruction, and perform a comprehensive evaluation across these paradigms, covering 42 model variants in terms of reconstruction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned generations. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality reconstruction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a self-refinement mechanism, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image reconstruction by at least 14\% and MER for missing text reconstruction by at least 10\% compared to baselines.

<title>Exploring Adapter Design Tradeoffs for Low Resource Music Generation</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and Mustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to billions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based methods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with minimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the design choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size, are numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce optimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter configurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres: Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.
  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in capturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short melodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range dependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze computational resource requirements across different adapter scales, demonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal balance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a diffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to the description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in notes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive and requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive models like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can produce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher redundancy in their generations.

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating. While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based personalization.

<title>Probabilistic Optimality for Inference-time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop OptScale, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. OptScale employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that OptScale significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE for enhancing GUI agents at both training and inference. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a continuous reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a ``Simple Thinking'' reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a cropping-based resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present decomposed grounding with selection to dramatically improve grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art grounding performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 while it also exhibits strong general agent capabilities. For instance, using both our training and inference enhancement methods brings 23\% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro. We provide the code in https://github.com/KDEGroup/UI-AGILE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such as content generation, question and answering (Q&amp;A), programming, and code reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques. We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges posed by hallucinations produced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, particularly dialogue systems. Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses, but these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate, or unverifiable facts. The authors introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact verification by verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue responses. They construct a dataset based on publicly available dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental results show that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can improve performance in dialogue fact verification. However, the best F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue dataset is only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future research. The dataset and code will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems. As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research. Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However, these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

<div> Keywords: human memory, language learning, neural networks, transformer models, reading times

Summary: 
- Human memory is limited in retaining exact wordforms during language processing, a concept believed to aid in language learning.
- The rise of transformer models challenges this notion as they can learn effectively without memory limitations.
- Controlled experiments on transformer models show that fleeting memory improves language learning but impairs prediction of reading times.
- The discrepancy in results cannot be explained by existing theories on the relationship between language modeling and reading time prediction.
- The study suggests that memory limitations benefit neural network language learning but do not enhance the prediction of human behavior. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly, impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly, follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling, yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

<div> Mirror models, Non-Mirror models, depression assessment scores, language AI models, criterion contamination<br />
Summary:<br />
The study compares the performance of Mirror and Non-Mirror language AI models in predicting depression assessment scores. Mirror models, developed from language mirroring assessment responses, showed inflated effect sizes, potentially due to criterion contamination. Non-Mirror models, developed from unrelated language data, had smaller effect sizes but higher generalizability. Both models performed similarly in correlating predicted scores with self-reported depression symptoms. Topic modeling identified clusters in both types of models and distinctions between true-positive and false-positive predictions. Incorporating Non-Mirror models may reveal unique, interpretable semantic features for more effective real-world psychological assessment using language AI models for depression. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These "Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4, GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models (using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 = .80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve, incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological assessment.

<div> Keywords: Emergent communication, deep neural network, attribute-value reconstruction game, inflectional morphology, concatenativity

Summary: 
In this study, researchers explore emergent communication using deep neural networks to understand human language. They focus on the attribute-value reconstruction game, simulating double articulation with a small-vocabulary constraint to mimic natural language features. By introducing phonological constraints, they observe a preference for concatenative morphology in the emergent languages. This approach allows meaningful comparisons to natural language communication schemes, particularly inflectional morphology. The study highlights how simulated constraints influence the emergence of communication patterns, with a particular focus on concatenativity and fusionality. The findings suggest that emergent languages exhibit tendencies similar to natural languages in terms of fusing grammatical attributes. <div>
arXiv:2508.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

<div> benchmark, affective computing, large language models, cognitive reasoning, emotion

Summary:
This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) reason about emotions through cognitive dimensions beyond surface-level emotion tasks. They introduce a benchmark called CoRE to evaluate the internal cognitive structures used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. The study delves into whether models implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal dimensions, the importance of cognitive dimensions in characterizing specific emotions, and the interpretation of different emotion categories in LLMs through cognitive appraisal dimensions. Results show diverse reasoning patterns across LLMs, highlighting the complexity of emotional reasoning in artificial intelligence systems. The research contributes to the advancement of affective computing and sheds light on the cognitive processes involved in emotional reasoning by AI models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however, approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli (e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, retrieval-augmented generation, Spectrum Projection Score, xCompress, QA benchmarks

Summary:
Spectrum Projection Score (SPS) is introduced as a metric to measure the semantic alignment of retrieved summaries with hidden representations in Large Language Models (LLMs). The xCompress framework uses SPS to dynamically sample, rank, and compress retrieval summary candidates during inference. Experimental results on five QA benchmarks with four LLMs demonstrate that SPS enhances performance across various tasks and offers insights into the interaction between retrieval and generation. The study addresses the challenge of isolating the true contribution of retrieval in improving generation performance, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers. The lightweight, supervision-free nature of SPS makes it a valuable tool for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation models. <div>
arXiv:2508.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge. However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers. We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress, an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

<div> Keywords: prosociality, text classification, human-AI interaction, annotation, inference

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of detecting prosocial content in text, focusing on affirming, supporting, or improving behaviors. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks clear definitions and labeled data, necessitating new approaches. The authors propose a three-stage pipeline for efficient and accurate prosocial content classification. They begin by identifying the best labeling strategy using a small human-labeled seed set and then implement a human-AI refinement loop to clarify and expand the task definition through annotator feedback. This iterative process enhances label quality and alignment. Subsequently, the authors synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and develop a two-stage inference system to handle ambiguous instances more efficiently. This architecture significantly reduces inference costs while maintaining high precision. Overall, the pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI interaction, meticulous task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design can enable scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

<div> Adversarial TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning, Cross-topic automated essay scoring, topic-shared features, topic-specific features, pre-trained language models (PLMs)<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The research introduces Adversarial TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP) to enhance cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) by considering both topic-shared and topic-specific features. ATOP optimizes a topic-aware prompt to extract relevant knowledge from pre-trained language models. Adversarial training is used to improve topic-shared prompt learning and reduce feature scale sensitivity. A neighbor-based classifier is applied to incorporate the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels guide the learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic. Extensive experiments on the ASAP++ dataset show that ATOP outperforms existing methods in holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of ATOP is publicly available for further study and application. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics. While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment, we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic. Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

<div> counter-example, attention sparsity, DistilBERT, sentiment analysis, implicit regularizer <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper explores the impact of introducing structured sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task. Contrary to common beliefs, the model's accuracy significantly improves with 80% attention sparsity, achieving a validation accuracy of 91.59%. The authors suggest that sparsity acts as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing overfitting by constraining the model to make predictions with a more robust set of features. This finding challenges the notion that attention sparsity only aids computational efficiency, highlighting its potential to enhance the generalization and performance of Transformer models. <div>
arXiv:2508.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the generalization and performance of Transformer models.

<div> Keywords: Self-Rewarding Language Models, Temporal Self-Rewarding, Anchored Rejection, Future-Guided Chosen, Generative capabilities<br />
Summary: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose a method where Large Language Models evaluate their own responses, but existing paradigms face a limitation in representational difference between samples. The proposed Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models address this by coordinating past, present, and future model generations. The framework includes Anchored Rejection to fix rejected responses using past model outputs and Future-Guided Chosen to curate selected samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive experiments across model families and sizes show significant improvements with Temporal Self-Rewarding. For example, Llama3.1-8B performs better on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to Self-Rewarding baseline. The method also excels in out-of-distribution generalization tasks like mathematical reasoning, knowledge-based QA, and code generation, showcasing superior performance without specific training data collection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces: (1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources. For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such training data.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, PEEK, Proxy Embeddings, Knowledge estimation, Factual landscape

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains encountered during generative pre-training. Existing methods to probe LLM knowledge are computationally expensive, prompting the development of PEEK, a method leveraging proxy embeddings to estimate LLM knowledge. By training embedding models on known facts and adapting them to predict LLM outputs, PEEK achieves up to 90% accuracy in predicting LLM knowledge. Sentence embeddings are found to be more suitable than graph embeddings for this task. This approach enables the identification of knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and provides insights into their internal inductive bias. The code and data for PEEK are available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

arXiv:2508.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training. However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts, curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However, these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or $\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate $\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Story Evaluation, Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning, Chain-of-Thought, Multi-Agent Strategy

Summary:
The research introduces the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in story evaluation tasks. By synthesizing score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data through a multi-persona strategy, the framework ensures data quality through a self-filtering process using multi-agents to validate logical rigor and robustness. The trained evaluator, deployed as a reward model, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation benchmarks. When utilized as a reward model for story generation tasks, the framework significantly enhances the quality of generated stories. The research addresses the limitations faced by existing methods by combining prompt engineering for closed-source models and fine-tuning approaches for open-source models, resulting in an adaptable and reasoning-capable solution for story evaluation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the self-evolving approach proposed in the EvolvR framework.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework. Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

Summary: 
ConlangCrafter is a new system that utilizes large-scale language models (LLMs) to aid in the creation of constructed languages (conlangs) without the need for human linguistic expertise. The system breaks down the language design process into distinct stages – phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation – each utilizing LLMs for meta-linguistic reasoning and randomness to foster diversity. ConlangCrafter incorporates self-refinement feedback to ensure consistency in the emerging language description. Through evaluation, the system has shown its capability to produce coherent and diverse conlangs. This innovative approach bridges the gap between computational creativity and linguistic diversity, offering a new tool for artists, philosophers, and language enthusiasts interested in constructing their own languages. The integration of advanced technology and linguistic principles in ConlangCrafter marks a significant step forward in the field of conlang creation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile, large-scale foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text, images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages -- phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities, injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs without human linguistic expertise.

Summary:
LogicRAG is a novel framework that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without the need for a pre-built graph. It decomposes queries into subproblems and constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model logical dependencies among them. Through topological sorting, LogicRAG enables coherent multi-step reasoning by addressing subproblems in a consistent order. It also employs graph pruning to reduce redundancy in retrieval and context pruning to filter irrelevant information, resulting in significant token cost reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of performance and efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph, introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware \textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented \textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments, and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for alignment-sensitive applications.

Summary: This article introduces Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation framework for enhancing the distillation of large language models (LLMs) into compact student models. SRD leverages reflections from student models to refine training data based on quality and compatibility with the student model. By selectively curating high-quality training instances and introducing them incrementally into the distillation process, SRD consistently improves model performance and reduces training runtime by up to 39%.

The study highlights the importance of data quality and student-model compatibility in knowledge distillation and provides practical insights for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of compressed LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However, existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

<div> bias detection method, implicit stereotypes, language models, social biases, interpretability

Summary: 
The paper introduces a bias detection method for large language models to identify hidden social biases. It utilizes nested semantic representation and contextual contrast to extract latent bias features from model outputs. By analyzing the model's sensitivity to social attribute terms through attention weight perturbation, the method reveals the pathways through which bias is formed. Evaluation on the StereoSet dataset shows the method's strong detection performance, accuracy in identifying bias differences, semantic alignment, and output stability. The method's structural design offers high interpretability, shedding light on internal bias mechanisms within language models. This approach provides a transparent and reliable foundation for bias detection in real-world applications where trustworthiness of generated content is crucial. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is required.

<div> sparsification, model merging, multi-task learning, TADrop, parameter interference
Summary:
TADrop is introduced as an adaptive sparsification strategy for model merging in multi-task learning. It tailors the sparsity level of each parameter tensor based on its distribution, allowing for more efficient pruning of redundant parameters while retaining critical ones. By integrating TADrop with various merging methods, significant performance improvements are observed across diverse tasks and models, such as ViT and BEiT. The approach outperforms traditional sparsification techniques by achieving an average performance gain of 2.0% across 8 ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop offers a new baseline for high-performance model merging by addressing the heterogeneity of model parameters and providing a more effective way to mitigate parameter interference. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single, powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference. However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy, applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop} (\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser, more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8 ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a new baseline for high-performance model merging.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Reinforcement Learning, Unified RAG and Reasoning, UR2 framework

Summary: 
The article introduces the UR2 framework, which aims to unify retrieval and reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning. It incorporates a difficulty-aware curriculum training method to selectively use retrieval for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy that combines offline data with LLM-generated summaries. By dynamically coordinating retrieval and reasoning, UR2 enhances adaptability across a variety of tasks, including open-domain QA, medical, and mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that UR2, built on Qwen2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, outperforms existing retrieval-augmented generation and reinforcement learning methods, achieving results comparable to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. The code, models, and data are openly available on GitHub for further research and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.

<div> Keywords: pragmatics, large language models, Human-Machine Communication, Rational Speech Act framework, context frustration

Summary: The paper challenges the traditional view of pragmatics as a third dimension of meaning and instead proposes it as a dynamic interface for language in social contexts. It argues that large language models destabilize hierarchies of meaning and introduces the Human-Machine Communication framework as a more suitable alternative. Traditional human-centered pragmatic theories clash with machine-centered LLMs, prompting a shift towards probabilistic pragmatics like the Rational Speech Act framework for better compatibility. The paper also addresses substitutionalism biases in LLM evaluation and the concept of context frustration, highlighting the need for users to co-construct pragmatic conditions for both the model and themselves. These points collectively suggest the necessity for adjusting or expanding pragmatic theory to effectively encompass communication involving generative AI.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding, emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving generative AI.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, knowledge acquisition, catastrophic forgetting, synthetic data, RAG-based approaches

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) require vast amounts of text for effective knowledge acquisition. Updating LLMs with limited data is challenging due to catastrophic forgetting. In this study, injecting small, unstructured information into LLMs was investigated using recent news data. Continuing pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, while exposing models to diverse textual variations significantly enhances learning new facts. The delicate balance between learning new content and retaining existing capabilities in small-data regimes was illustrated. RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection showed sensitivity, leading to greater degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Models demonstrated the ability to generate effective synthetic training data, paving the way for self-improving model updates. The study's code and generated data are publicly available, offering a resource for studying efficient knowledge injection in LLMs with limited data.

arXiv:2508.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small, unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information. Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a resource for studying efficient knowledge injection in LLMs with limited data at https://github.com/hugoabonizio/knowledge-injection-methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters. The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data (including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13 distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and 127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic, association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference, and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets, including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of 89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases, along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

Summary: SceneJailEval introduces a new multi-dimensional framework for precise jailbreak evaluation, addressing the limitations of existing methods by being scenario-adaptive and extensible. It includes a comprehensive dataset with 14 scenarios to fill the gap in benchmarks. SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 0.917 on the full scenario dataset and 0.995 on JBB, surpassing previous methods and confirming its advantage in evaluating diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases. <div>
arXiv:2508.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no" labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness) apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3) SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

Abstract: Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a critical yet underexplored dimension in the development of human-aligned LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a unified, psychologically grounded four-layer taxonomy of EI tailored for large language models (LLMs), encompassing emotional tracking, cause inference, appraisal, and emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma (9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench, identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale, instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach to content moderation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which leverages contextual knowledge for classification tasks. The system, called the Contextual Policy Engine (CPE), offers robust accuracy comparable to commercial systems, explainability through retrieved policy segments, and the ability to update policies dynamically without retraining. The approach shifts the focus from determining the correct category to evaluating content in relation to policy violations. Through experiments, the system demonstrates strong baseline performance and the capability to adjust protection for specific identity groups without retraining or compromising overall accuracy. This research establishes that RAG can enhance classification processes, making them more flexible, transparent, and adaptable for a range of content moderation and classification tasks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have showcased impressive perception and reasoning abilities, but causal inference remains underexplored in multimodal settings. InfoCausalQA introduces a benchmark for evaluating causal reasoning in VLMs using infographics and text, addressing quantitative and semantic causal reasoning tasks. The benchmark dataset was manually collected and revised to ensure questions require genuine visual grounding. Experimental results highlight the limitations of current VLMs in computational and semantic causal reasoning, emphasizing the significance of enhancing causal reasoning abilities in multimodal AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored, particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect, intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494 infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate 1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary. Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition. Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

Summary:
Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR) is a novel method proposed to detect plagiarism in large language models (LLMs). It addresses the shortcomings of existing methods by accurately reconstructing weight relationships, providing rigorous p-value estimation, and focusing on weight similarity without full model inference. MDIR has the capability to detect plagiarism even after extensive transformations such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens. Importantly, all detections can be performed on a single PC within an hour, ensuring efficiency and accessibility. This method aims to combat the serious misconduct of plagiarizing other LLMs without proper attribution, which can result in significant financial and reputational harm to the original developers. MDIR offers a reliable solution to the growing concerns about intellectual property in the field of large language models.

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

Summary:
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform diverse domain question-answering tasks, including graph QA, but existing approaches using single Topology Representation Forms (TRFs) may lead to incorrect or lengthy responses. To address this, researchers have proposed a set of TRFs tailored for zero-shot graph QA, introduced the Graph Response Efficiency metric to balance performance and brevity, and developed the DynamicTRF framework. This framework includes creating a TRF Preference dataset to identify TRF preferences, training a TRF router to adaptively select the best TRF for each question during inference. Experimental results on algorithmic graph QA tasks show that DynamicTRF significantly improves the accuracy of zero-shot graph QA for LMMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF), such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those "one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses. To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency (GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific, DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from $F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7 in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms of accuracy

Summary: 
This study explores the effectiveness of integrating aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework for improving cyberbullying detection on social media. Experiments using instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) on multiple datasets demonstrate the potential of this approach. Different strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, LoRA fine-tuning, and multi-task learning were evaluated, with the enriched prompt pipeline approach showing consistent outperformance of standard fine-tuning. The incorporation of aggression predictions into cyberbullying detection prompts provides contextual augmentation, leading to enhanced detection performance. This highlights the importance of auxiliary tasks such as aggression detection in improving the generalization of LLMs for safety-critical applications on social networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs) in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical applications on social networks.

Abstract: While prior research has built tools and benchmarks towards style personalized text generation, there has been limited exploration of evaluation in low-resource author style personalized text generation space. Through this work, we question the effectiveness of the widely adopted evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, and explore other evaluation paradigms such as style embeddings and LLM-as-judge to holistically evaluate the style personalized text generation task. We evaluate these metrics and their ensembles using our style discrimination benchmark, that spans eight writing tasks, and evaluates across three settings, domain discrimination, authorship attribution, and LLM personalized vs non-personalized discrimination. We provide conclusive evidence to adopt ensemble of diverse evaluation metrics to effectively evaluate style personalized text generation.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities in providing emotional support and role-playing conversations separately. This study aims to bridge the gap by focusing on emotionally supportive interactions with anime characters. The ChatAnime dataset is introduced, featuring 20 anime characters and 60 emotion-centric scenario questions. Dialogue data from LLMs and anime enthusiasts were collected and evaluated using user-centric metrics. Results indicate that LLMs excel in role-playing and emotional support compared to human fans, but humans outperform them in response diversity. The dataset, containing human-written and LLM-generated answers with over 132,000 annotations, aims to provide valuable resources for future research. The dataset is available at https://github.com/LanlanQiu/ChatAnime.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases. This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from 10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue, role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000 LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations. Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at https://github.com/LanlanQiu/ChatAnime.

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external tools but highlights security and privacy risks. Adversarial content can lead to conversation hijacking, misinformation, or data theft. Existing defenses are inadequate, prompting the proposal of SecMCP, a secure framework detecting conversation drift in LLMs' latent space. By modeling LLM activation vectors in a latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous conversational dynamics shifts, enabling proactive detection of hijacking and data exfiltration. The framework is evaluated on three LLMs and benchmark datasets, showing robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while maintaining usability. Contributions include systematic categorization of MCP security threats, a latent polytope-based method for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of SecMCP's effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration. Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA), demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of SecMCP's efficacy.

Summary:
In this work, the authors explore strategies to enhance agents' performance by introducing a learnable and updatable procedural memory system called Memp. This memory repository distills past agent trajectories into detailed instructions and higher-level abstractions, continuously evolving with new experiences through dynamic updates. The study evaluates the impact of different strategies for building, retrieving, and updating procedural memory on tasks like TravelPlanner and ALFWorld. Results show that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve higher success rates and efficiency. Additionally, transferring the procedural memory from a stronger model to a weaker one leads to significant performance gains. This approach addresses the issue of brittle procedural memory in Large Language Models and highlights the importance of dynamic memory update mechanisms for enhancing agent performance in diverse tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Scalable, inclusive research with 35 times faster inference at low cost.<br /><br />Summary: Large language models are used for analyzing immigration-related tweets in multiple languages. Fine-tuning in one or two languages allows reliable content classification in unseen languages. Identifying pro- or anti-immigration stances benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias towards dominant languages can be corrected with minimal exposure to under-represented languages during fine-tuning. The release of 4-bit-quantised LoRA fine-tuned models provides an open-source and reproducible alternative to proprietary models, enabling faster and more cost-effective research. <div>
arXiv:2508.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However, identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing 4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source, reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model, enabling scalable, inclusive research.

The researchers analyzed over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college sources using advanced AI-text detectors. They found a significant increase in the use of Generative AI, particularly in local and college news outlets. The study revealed that LLMs are frequently used in the introduction of news articles, while conclusions are typically manually written. Linguistic analysis showed that GenAI enhances word richness and readability but reduces formality, resulting in more uniform writing styles, particularly in local media.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, poses concerns for journalistic integrity and authorship. This study examines AI-generated content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g., Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform writing styles, particularly in local media.

- The code for SlimInfer will be made available upon acceptance for further exploration and application in the field. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Summary:  
Haptic captioning involves generating natural language descriptions from haptic signals like vibrations for use in various applications. The proposed HapticLLaMA model interprets vibration signals into descriptions in specific categories, trained through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The model achieved high scores in automated n-gram metrics and human evaluation, demonstrating its strong capability in interpreting haptic signals. Over 61% of generated captions received positive human ratings, with RLHF showing a 10% improvement in overall rating distribution. These results highlight the potential of language models in processing and adapting to sensory data.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality, accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory, emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation, and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, convention formation, fine-tuning, benchmark, document-grounded reference completion

Summary: 
LLMs, or large language models, typically do not naturally demonstrate efficient communication in multi-turn interactions. In this study, researchers introduce a post-training process that involves targeted fine-tuning on demonstrations of convention formation to improve this ability. Two new benchmarks were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the post-training process. The first benchmark, designed to elicit convention formation trends in humans, demonstrated consistent improvement in LLMs. The second benchmark focused on document-grounded reference completion, further showcasing enhanced convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs. These findings suggest that targeted fine-tuning on heuristically identified demonstrations can significantly improve LLMs' convention formation capabilities.

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused, cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation methods.

Summary: AttriLens-Mol is a framework for molecular property prediction with Large Language Models (LLMs) that uses attribute-guided reinforcement learning to steer model reasoning. It encourages structured output based on attributes, avoids irrelevant attributes, and verifies relatedness using advanced LLMs and RDKit.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process, their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1) a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models (Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction. We release the code in https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

<div> query rewriting, RAG Fusion, keyword augmentation, intent recognition, context reranking <br />
<br />
Summary: 
This case study evaluates various techniques for enhancing the performance of AI customer service systems in the electric power domain. The study compares vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, with the graph-based RAG being selected for its superior handling of complex queries. Query rewriting proves beneficial for non-standard or detail-specific queries, while RAG Fusion excels in resolving vague or multi-intent queries. Context reranking helps filter out irrelevant information, while intent recognition aids in breaking down complex questions into more manageable sub-queries. However, keyword augmentation is found to have a negative impact due to biased keyword selection. By combining intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking techniques, the final system achieves high accuracy rates of 97.9% and 89.6% on GPT-4-generated and real-world electricity provider FAQ datasets, respectively, surpassing baseline RAG models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Many AI customer service systems use standard NLP pipelines or finetuned language models, which often fall short on ambiguous, multi-intent, or detail-specific queries. This case study evaluates recent techniques: query rewriting, RAG Fusion, keyword augmentation, intent recognition, and context reranking, for building a robust customer support system in the electric power domain. We compare vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, ultimately selecting the graph-based RAG for its superior performance in handling complex queries. We find that query rewriting improves retrieval for queries using non-standard terminology or requiring precise detail. RAG Fusion boosts performance on vague or multifaceted queries by merging multiple retrievals. Reranking reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant contexts. Intent recognition supports the decomposition of complex questions into more targeted sub-queries, increasing both relevance and efficiency. In contrast, keyword augmentation negatively impacts results due to biased keyword selection. Our final system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to handle disambiguation and multi-source queries. Evaluated on both a GPT-4-generated dataset and a real-world electricity provider FAQ dataset, it achieves 97.9% and 89.6% accuracy respectively, substantially outperforming baseline RAG models.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study focuses on accurately converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial reports into Markdown format using a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). The model was optimized for high-fidelity Markdown generation and evaluated on 100 out-of-sample tables using a criteria-based assessment and a Markdown Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric. The model achieved a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score, surpassing larger-scale VLMs and specialized reasoning-enabled models. It also outperformed widely used proprietary models like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash while reducing inference time. These results highlight the effectiveness of domain-specific fine-tuning in bridging the gap between unstructured financial documents and downstream automation, offering a more efficient alternative to larger and more general models. <div>

Abstract: Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding, particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts, multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash. These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general models without their computational overhead.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly integrated into customer service and moderation applications, adversarial threats emerge from both external manipulations and internal label corruption. In this work, we identify and systematically address these dual adversarial threats by introducing DINA (Dual Defense Against Internal Noise and Adversarial Attacks), a novel unified framework tailored specifically for NLP. Our approach adapts advanced noisy-label learning methods from computer vision and integrates them with adversarial training to simultaneously mitigate internal label sabotage and external adversarial perturbations. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from an online gaming service demonstrate that DINA significantly improves model robustness and accuracy compared to baseline models. Our findings not only highlight the critical necessity of dual-threat defenses but also offer practical strategies for safeguarding NLP systems in realistic adversarial scenarios, underscoring broader implications for fair and responsible AI deployment.

Summary: 
Insider threat detection is a challenging task in cybersecurity due to the complex and context-dependent nature of malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models struggle to capture semantic intent and behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based solutions have limitations in adaptability and modality coverage. To address these issues, the DMFI framework integrates semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning, converting raw logs into structured views for analysis. By combining two LoRA-enhanced LLMs and a decision module, DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy on CERT datasets. The introduction of DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy, enhances robustness under class imbalance. This approach effectively combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with structured behavior modeling, providing a scalable and deployable solution for insider threat detection. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) poses a persistent and high-impact challenge in cybersecurity due to the subtle, long-term, and context-dependent nature of malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models often struggle to capture semantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based solutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into two structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts (e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral abstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation to encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned independently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision module. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that separates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness under severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with structured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for real-world insider threat detection. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLM reasoning with structured behavioral modeling, offering a scalable and deployable solution for modern insider threat detection.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment, which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks designed to test generalization and semantic understanding.

Abstract: This dialog paper offers a preview and provides a foretaste of an upcoming work on the axiomatization of basic interactive algorithms.
  The modern notion of algorithm was elucidated in the 1930s--1950s. It was axiomatized a quarter of a century ago as the notion of ``sequential algorithm'' or ``classical algorithm''; we prefer to call it ``basic algorithm" now. The axiomatization was used to show that for every basic algorithm there is a behaviorally equivalent abstract state machine. It was also used to prove the Church-Turing thesis as it has been understood by the logicians.
  Starting from the 1960s, the notion of algorithm has expanded -- probabilistic algorithms, quantum algorithms, etc. -- prompting introduction of a much more ambitious version of the Church-Turing thesis commonly known as the ``physical thesis.'' We emphasize the difference between the two versions of the Church-Turing thesis and illustrate how nondeterministic and probabilistic algorithms can be viewed as basic algorithms with appropriate oracles. The same view applies to quantum circuit algorithms and many other classes of algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing by leveraging audio codecs to discretize audio into tokens, enabling the application of language modeling techniques to speech data. However, existing audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, leading to slow training and inference, particularly for autoregressive models. To address this, there is growing interest in low frame-rate audio codecs, which reduce the number of autoregressive steps required to generate one second of audio. In this paper, we conduct ablation studies to examine the impact of frame rate, bitrate, and causality on codec reconstruction quality. Based on our findings, we introduce NanoCodec, a state-of-the-art audio codec that achieves high-quality compression at just 12.5 frames per second (FPS). NanoCodec outperforms related works across various bitrate ranges, establishing a new benchmark for low-latency and efficient Speech LLM training and inference.

<title>Do Ethical AI Principles Matter to Users? A Large-Scale Analysis of User Sentiment and Satisfaction</title>

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly embedded in organizational workflows and consumer applications, ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and robustness have been widely endorsed in policy and industry guidelines. However, there is still scarce empirical evidence on whether these principles are recognized, valued, or impactful from the perspective of users. This study investigates the link between ethical AI and user satisfaction by analyzing over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2. Using transformer-based language models, we measure sentiment across seven ethical dimensions defined by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Our findings show that all seven dimensions are positively associated with user satisfaction. Yet, this relationship varies systematically across user and product types. Technical users and reviewers of AI development platforms more frequently discuss system-level concerns (e.g., transparency, data governance), while non-technical users and reviewers of end-user applications emphasize human-centric dimensions (e.g., human agency, societal well-being). Moreover, the association between ethical AI and user satisfaction is significantly stronger for non-technical users and end-user applications across all dimensions. Our results highlight the importance of ethical AI design from users' perspectives and underscore the need to account for contextual differences across user roles and product types.

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.

Abstract: Intelligent coding systems are transforming software development by enabling users to specify code behavior in natural language. However, the opaque decision-making of AI-driven coders raises trust and usability concerns, particularly for non-expert users who cannot inspect low-level implementations. We argue that these systems should not only generate code but also produce clear, consistent justifications that bridge model reasoning and user understanding. To this end, we identify two critical justification properties-cognitive alignment and semantic faithfulness-and highlight the limitations of existing methods, including formal verification, static analysis, and post-hoc explainability. We advocate exploring neuro-symbolic approaches for justification generation, where symbolic constraints guide model behavior during training and program semantics are enriched through neural representations, enabling automated consistency checks at inference time.

Abstract: State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.

Abstract: Generative AI has made image creation more accessible, yet aligning outputs with nuanced creative intent remains challenging, particularly for non-experts. Existing tools often require users to externalize ideas through prompts or references, limiting fluid exploration. We introduce ThematicPlane, a system that enables users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts (e.g., mood, style, or narrative tone) within an interactive thematic design plane. This interface bridges the gap between tacit creative intent and system control. In our exploratory study (N=6), participants engaged in divergent and convergent creative modes, often embracing unexpected results as inspiration or iteration cues. While they grounded their exploration in familiar themes, differing expectations of how themes mapped to outputs revealed a need for more explainable controls. Overall, ThematicPlane fosters expressive, iterative workflows and highlights new directions for intuitive, semantics-driven interaction in generative design tools.

Abstract: This systematic review of the research literature on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a focused analysis of the most highly cited studies published between 2020 and May 2025. A total of 128 articles met our inclusion criteria. The records were retrieved from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP). RAG couples a neural retriever with a generative language model, grounding output in up-to-date, non-parametric memory while retaining the semantic generalisation stored in model weights. Guided by the PRISMA 2020 framework, we (i) specify explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria based on citation count and research questions, (ii) catalogue datasets, architectures, and evaluation practices, and (iii) synthesise empirical evidence on the effectiveness and limitations of RAG. To mitigate citation-lag bias, we applied a lower citation-count threshold to papers published in 2025 so that emerging breakthroughs with naturally fewer citations were still captured. This review clarifies the current research landscape, highlights methodological gaps, and charts priority directions for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective, combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical, sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking greater performance from limited data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.

<title>Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding</title>

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer (QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring 250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at: https://github.com/yuweiyang-anu/ECD.

Abstract: Semantic Overlap Summarization (SOS) is a constrained multi-document summarization task, where the constraint is to capture the common/overlapping information between two alternative narratives. In this work, we perform a benchmarking study of popular Large Language Models (LLMs) exclusively on the SOS task. Additionally, we introduce the PrivacyPolicyPairs (3P) dataset to expand the space of SOS benchmarks in terms of quantity and variety. This dataset provides 135 high-quality SOS data samples sourced from privacy policy documents. We then use a standard prompting taxonomy called TELeR to create and evaluate 905,216 distinct LLM-generated summaries over two SOS datasets from different domains, and we further conduct human evaluation on a subset of 540 samples. We conclude the paper by analyzing models' performances and the reliability of automatic evaluation. The code and datasets used to conduct this study are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm_eval-E16D.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the state-of-the-art of many different natural language processing tasks. Although serving LLMs is computationally and memory demanding, the rise of Small Language Models (SLMs) offers new opportunities for resource-constrained users, who now are able to serve small models with cutting-edge performance. In this paper, we present a set of experiments designed to benchmark SLM inference at performance and energy levels. Our analysis provides a new perspective in serving, highlighting that the small memory footprint of SLMs allows for reaching the Pareto-optimal throughput within the resource capacity of a single accelerator. In this regard, we present an initial set of findings demonstrating how model replication can effectively improve resource utilization for serving SLMs.

Abstract: Extract-then-Abstract is a naturally coherent paradigm to conduct abstractive summarization with the help of salient information identified by the extractive model. Previous works that adopt this paradigm train the extractor and abstractor separately and introduce extra parameters to highlight the extracted salients to the abstractor, which results in error accumulation and additional training costs. In this paper, we first introduce a parameter-free highlight method into the encoder-decoder framework: replacing the encoder attention mask with a saliency mask in the cross-attention module to force the decoder to focus only on salient parts of the input. A preliminary analysis compares different highlight methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our saliency mask. We further propose the novel extract-and-abstract paradigm, ExtAbs., which jointly and seamlessly performs Extractive and Abstractive summarization tasks within single encoder-decoder model to reduce error accumulation. In ExtAbs, the vanilla encoder is augmented to extract salients, and the vanilla decoder is modified with the proposed saliency mask to generate summaries. Built upon BART and PEGASUS, experiments on three datasets show that ExtAbs can achieve superior performance than baselines on the extractive task and performs comparable, or even better than the vanilla models on the abstractive task.

Abstract: Large language models, despite extensive alignment with human values and ethical principles, remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit their reasoning abilities. Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. To counter this, we propose Intent-Aware CoT and Reverse Thinking CoT, which decompose queries to detect malicious intent and reason in reverse to evaluate and reject harmful responses. These methods enhance reasoning robustness and strengthen the model's defense against adversarial exploits.

<title>The Alternative Annotator Test for LLM-as-a-Judge: How to Statistically Justify Replacing Human Annotators with LLMs</title>

Abstract: The "LLM-as-an-annotator" and "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.

Abstract: Transformative innovations in model architectures have introduced hierarchical embedding augmentation as a means to redefine the representation of tokens through multi-level semantic structures, offering enhanced adaptability to complex linguistic inputs. Autonomous structural memory manipulation further advances this paradigm through dynamic memory reallocation mechanisms that prioritize critical contextual features while suppressing less relevant information, enabling scalable and efficient performance across diverse tasks. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in computational efficiency, with marked reductions in processing overhead for longer input sequences, achieved through memory reorganization strategies that adapt to evolving contextual requirements. Hierarchical embeddings not only improved contextual alignment but also facilitated task generalization by capturing relationships at varying semantic granularities, ensuring coherence across layers without introducing significant computational redundancies. Comparative analysis against baseline models demonstrated unique advantages in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, particularly in tasks requiring complex contextual understanding or domain-specific adaptability. The ability to dynamically adjust token representations and memory configurations contributed to the model's robustness under varied and unpredictable input conditions. Applications benefiting from these advancements include multi-domain generalization, interactive systems, and scenarios involving real-time decision-making, where traditional static memory architectures often face limitations. The proposed methodology combines advanced embedding and memory management strategies into a cohesive framework that addresses scalability challenges while preserving task-specific relevance.

Abstract: Structured embedding transformations offer a promising approach for enhancing the efficiency and coherence of language model inference. The introduction of Structural Embedding Projection (SEP) provides a mechanism for refining token representations through projection matrices that integrate hierarchical and relational dependencies. The mathematical formulation of SEP enables embedding spaces to capture structured contextual relationships, thereby improving semantic fidelity without significantly increasing computational overhead. Experimental evaluations conducted on a range of linguistic datasets revealed that SEP contributed to reductions in perplexity and enhanced contextual coherence, demonstrating its potential to refine language model outputs. Computational efficiency assessments highlighted variations across different datasets, suggesting that the integration of structured embeddings introduced dataset-dependent trade-offs between inference speed and representational richness. The qualitative analysis of generated responses indicated that SEP enhanced narrative consistency and topic alignment, leading to improved fluency in multi-sentence text generation. The modifications to embedding layers required precise optimization to ensure stable training dynamics, as the introduction of structured transformations altered the traditional representation-learning process. The architectural adjustments necessary for SEP implementation influenced inference latency and memory consumption, requiring a balance between efficiency gains and additional processing demands. The impact of SEP on lexical diversity suggested that embedding modifications influenced the model's vocabulary usage, reflecting a more context-aware selection of generated tokens.

Abstract: Handling long-range dependencies in neural architectures has remained a persistent challenge due to computational limitations and inefficient contextual retention mechanisms. Tensorial operations have provided a foundation for restructuring model representations, yet conventional architectures have struggled to incorporate such techniques without introducing excessive complexity. A novel approach, Context-Preserving Tensorial Reconfiguration (CPTR), enables dynamic reorganization of weight tensors through structured factorization and adaptive contraction, allowing for enhanced contextual integration without substantial computational overhead. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CPTR improves coherence retention across extended sequences, leading to measurable reductions in perplexity and improved recall accuracy for long-context tasks. Performance comparisons reveal that CPTR-enhanced models exhibit greater computational efficiency and reduced memory consumption while maintaining competitive language generation fluency and accuracy. Gradient stability metrics further validate the improved training efficiency, revealing more controlled variance in weight updates. Comparative studies across baseline and CPTR-enhanced models confirm that tensorial reconfiguration contributes to more stable and computationally efficient language modeling. The findings support the potential of CPTR in refining contemporary neural architectures for tasks requiring long-range contextual understanding and efficient memory utilization.

Abstract: Token representations influence the efficiency and adaptability of language models, yet conventional tokenization strategies impose rigid segmentation boundaries that do not adjust dynamically to evolving contextual relationships. The introduction of contextual morphogenesis establishes a self-organizing mechanism that restructures token boundaries based on learned contextual dependencies, allowing embeddings to evolve progressively across iterative processing steps. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that dynamically adjusted tokenization contributes to reductions in perplexity while maintaining representational stability, particularly in linguistically complex domains where static segmentation fails to capture nuanced dependencies. Computational trade-offs associated with self-organizing token structures indicate that additional processing overhead remains within feasible limits, provided that optimization strategies account for segmentation update efficiency. Comparative assessments across different linguistic corpora suggest that adaptive tokenization preserves interpretability while improving alignment with contextual cues, reinforcing the potential of morphogenetic segmentation mechanisms to refine predictive accuracy. Stability analyses confirm that evolving token structures maintain consistent segmentation behaviors across varied text distributions, ensuring that representational adaptations remain linguistically coherent. The effectiveness of contextual morphogenesis in refining structural stability and predictive performance highlights its viability as an alternative to traditional tokenization methods. Further analysis of computational efficiency considerations suggests that hybrid strategies integrating both static and dynamic segmentation techniques may offer a balanced approach to optimizing representational flexibility while maintaining inference efficiency.

Abstract: Hierarchical Merging is a technique commonly used to summarize very long texts ($>$100K tokens) by breaking down the input into smaller sections, summarizing those sections individually, and then merging or combining those summaries into a final coherent summary. Although it helps address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) with fixed input length constraints, the recursive merging process can amplify LLM hallucinations, increasing the risk of factual inaccuracies. In this paper, we seek to mitigate hallucinations by enriching hierarchical merging with context from the source document. Specifically, we propose different approaches to contextual augmentation ranging from \emph{replacing} intermediate summaries with relevant input context, to \emph{refining} them while using the context as supporting evidence, and \emph{aligning} them implicitly (via citations) to the input. Experimental results on datasets representing legal and narrative domains show that contextual augmentation consistently outperforms zero-shot and hierarchical merging baselines for the Llama 3.1 model family. Our analysis further reveals that refinement methods tend to perform best when paired with extractive summarization for identifying relevant input.

Abstract: Generating structured textual content requires mechanisms that enforce coherence, stability, and adherence to predefined constraints while maintaining semantic fidelity. Conventional approaches often rely on rule-based heuristics or fine-tuning strategies that lack flexibility and generalizability across diverse tasks. The incorporation of Gradient-Regularized Latent Space Modulation (GRLSM) introduces a novel paradigm for guiding text generation through the application of structured constraints within the latent space. The integration of gradient-based regularization mitigates abrupt variations in latent representations, ensuring a smoother encoding process that enhances structural consistency and logical progression within generated sequences. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that latent space modulation leads to a reduction in perplexity, increased coherence scores, and improved structural alignment across multiple domains. Stability assessments further indicate that the imposition of spectral norm constraints facilitates more controlled variations in generated text, preserving semantic consistency under input perturbations. Empirical results confirm that structured latent space constraints not only refine the organization of generated outputs but also enhance interpretability through more predictable and reliable synthesis patterns. Performance metrics illustrate that the GRLSM framework substantially reduces structural inconsistencies while preserving the generative flexibility inherent in neural models.

Abstract: Stochastic embedding transitions introduce a probabilistic mechanism for adjusting token representations dynamically during inference, mitigating the constraints imposed through static or deterministic embeddings. A transition framework was proposed in which each token embedding evolved through probabilistic updates, ensuring adaptability while preserving semantic integrity across linguistic contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that models incorporating stochastic transitions exhibited greater lexical diversity, improved generative coherence, and enhanced retention of low-frequency vocabulary, contributing to more varied sentence structures and reduced reliance on high-probability token selections. Statistical analyses of embedding drift across transformer layers indicated that representations evolved more flexibly without losing coherence, supporting the hypothesis that controlled stochasticity facilitated context-sensitive representation learning. Experimental results revealed that probabilistic embeddings introduced minor computational overhead while maintaining generative efficiency, reinforcing their feasibility in large-scale applications. A comparative study with traditional embedding approaches highlighted measurable gains in text completion accuracy, dialogue coherence, and structural complexity, confirming the effectiveness of stochastic transitions in enhancing representation expressiveness. Clustering patterns in the embedding space suggested that probabilistic updates preserved meaningful semantic groupings while enabling context-driven shifts, further validating the stability of the transition mechanism. Performance metrics indicated that stochastic transitions balanced adaptability and control, ensuring that generative outputs remained linguistically coherent without excessive randomness.

Abstract: Symbolic perturbations offer a novel approach for influencing neural representations without requiring direct modification of model parameters. The recursive regeneration of symbolic structures introduces structured variations in latent embeddings, leading to controlled shifts in attention dynamics and lexical diversity across sequential generations. A comparative analysis with conventional fine-tuning techniques reveals that structural modifications at the symbolic level induce distinct variations in contextual sensitivity while maintaining overall model fluency and coherence. Shifts in attention weight distributions highlight the role of symbolic modifications in adjusting token dependencies, influencing response variability, and refining long-form text generation. Experimental findings suggest that symbolic perturbations can enhance adaptability in domain-specific applications, allowing modifications in model behavior without retraining. Evaluations of semantic drift indicate that recursive regeneration alters long-range token dependencies, affecting topic coherence across extended text sequences. Results from lexical variability assessments further support the conclusion that symbolic-level modifications introduce interpretable variations in generated responses, potentially enabling more controlled stylistic adjustments in automated text generation.

Abstract: Structured neuron encapsulation introduces a modular framework that enables more effective aggregation and specialization of information within deep learning architectures. A model modified through this framework demonstrated improved perplexity scores, greater lexical variability, and enhanced consistency in logical reasoning, suggesting that structured parameter distribution contributes to more efficient language representation. Statistical analyses of generated text highlighted a wider range of sentence structures and reduced redundancy in token selection, indicating that encapsulation fosters more adaptable language generation. A detailed evaluation of attention weight distributions revealed that the experimental model exhibited greater divergence in cross-layer activations, supporting the hypothesis that encapsulated neurons assume specialized processing roles. Logical consistency assessments further demonstrated that modular architectures mitigate contradictory outputs, reducing internal conflicts in inferred relationships between linguistic constructs. Computational trade-offs were analyzed, with results showing a minor increase in processing overhead, though improvements in parameter efficiency and structured decision-making compensated for the additional complexity. The mathematical formulation of the encapsulation mechanism confirmed that modular aggregation maintains stable convergence properties while promoting distinct functional roles for different neuron clusters.

Abstract: Token representations in high-dimensional latent spaces often exhibit redundancy, limiting computational efficiency and reducing structural coherence across model layers. Hierarchical latent space folding introduces a structured transformation mechanism that enforces a multi-scale organization within learned embeddings, refining representational compactness while preserving essential contextual distinctions. The proposed approach incorporates dynamic folding operations that iteratively adjust token embeddings through structured transformations, influencing both short-range and long-range dependencies in sequential processing tasks. Empirical evaluation demonstrates a reduction in representational variance across layers, contributing to more stable perplexity distributions and enhancing predictive confidence in text generation. The structured redistribution of attention head utilization leads to more efficient allocation of computational resources, particularly in deeper layers, where hierarchical refinements improve contextual abstraction. Comparative analysis of activation sparsity patterns suggests that hierarchical adjustments selectively reinforce critical pathways while reducing computational overhead in non-essential regions of the model. Statistical assessments of token reordering frequencies reveal that hierarchical modifications introduce subtle shifts in sequential dependencies, improving contextual alignment while maintaining syntactic correctness. Computational trade-offs associated with hierarchical folding introduce marginal increases in training time per epoch, yet empirical findings indicate that inference efficiency benefits from the structured representation adjustments. The results highlight the impact of hierarchical latent space folding on optimizing model performance through improved representation structuring and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Representation learning plays a central role in structuring internal embeddings to capture the statistical properties of language, influencing the coherence and contextual consistency of generated text. Statistical Coherence Alignment is introduced as a method to enforce structured token representations through tensor field convergence, guiding embeddings to reflect statistical dependencies inherent in linguistic data. A mathematical framework is established to quantify coherence alignment, integrating a loss function that optimizes representational consistency across training iterations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that applying coherence constraints improves perplexity, enhances classification accuracy, and refines rare word embeddings, contributing to a more stable representation space. Comparative analyses with baseline models reveal that the proposed method fosters a more interpretable internal structure, ensuring that embeddings retain contextual dependencies while mitigating representation collapse. The impact on coherence score distributions suggests that the alignment mechanism strengthens semantic integrity across diverse linguistic constructs, leading to a more balanced organization of learned embeddings. Computational assessments indicate that while the method introduces additional memory and training costs, the structured optimization process justifies the trade-offs in applications requiring heightened contextual fidelity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of coherence alignment in optimizing token representations, providing insights into how statistical dependencies can be leveraged to improve language model training.

Abstract: Contextual memory integration remains a high challenge in the development of language models, particularly in tasks that require maintaining coherence over extended sequences. Traditional approaches, such as self-attention mechanisms and memory-augmented architectures, often prioritize short-term dependencies, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency in long-range contextual understanding. Inspired by principles of synaptic plasticity observed in biological neural systems, a novel mechanism, Synaptic Resonance, is introduced to dynamically reinforce relevant memory pathways during training and inference. Unlike static memory representations, this mechanism continuously adjusts synaptic weight matrices based on contextual relevance, allowing for improved information retention without excessive computational overhead. Evaluations conducted on an open-source language model demonstrate reductions in perplexity, enhancements in contextual coherence, and increased robustness against input noise, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven memory modulation. Comparative analysis against baseline models further reveals that the proposed approach achieves higher memory retention efficiency while maintaining computational feasibility. The architectural modifications integrate seamlessly into existing transformer-based frameworks, ensuring stable convergence and efficient inference without sacrificing scalability. Applications benefiting from improved long-term contextual consistency, such as dialogue systems and document summarization, stand to gain from this approach. Empirical findings suggest that dynamically reinforced memory pathways offer a promising alternative to conventional memory mechanisms, addressing longstanding limitations in extended sequence modeling.

Abstract: Self-modulating mechanisms introduce dynamic adaptation capabilities within language models through contextual realignment strategies that influence token embedding trajectories across extended sequences. Contextual Flux is explored as an approach to embedding modulation, integrating an auxiliary gating mechanism within the self-attention framework to dynamically adjust token representations based on evolving contextual dependencies. The empirical analysis evaluates entropy variations, latent space realignments, and coherence stability to assess the extent to which self-regulation enhances text generation consistency while preserving generative flexibility. Quantitative assessments suggest that embedding shifts contribute to more structured adaptation in long-form sequences, with measured reductions in redundant phrase repetitions and improvements in thematic retention. Variability in contextual weight computation affects modulation stability, leading to differing levels of adaptation across diverse linguistic structures. The computational demands introduced through real-time embedding reconfiguration are examined in relation to model scalability, emphasizing the need for optimization strategies in high-volume generative applications. The findings suggest that while adaptive embedding updates improve certain aspects of coherence, their impact remains contingent on model capacity and input complexity.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly affected by the quality and composition of their pre-training data, which is inherently diverse, spanning various languages, sources, and topics. Effectively integrating these heterogeneous data groups is crucial for optimizing LLM performance. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on source-based data mixing, often neglecting the nuanced topic-level characteristics of the data. To address this gap, we propose a topic-based data mixing strategy that utilizes detailed topic labels generated through a multi-stage process combining unsupervised clustering, LLM-based summarization, and supervised classifier training. With this strategy, we conduct the first comprehensive comparison of topic-based versus source-based partitioning across multiple mixing strategies. We demonstrate that language models pretrained on data mixed by topics consistently outperform those trained on data mixed by sources across multiple methods including RegMix, DoReMi,temperature-based sampling, and a manual mixing method based on downstream task performance. Our theoretical analysis reveals that topic-based data achieves significantly lower validation loss compared to source-based approaches, creating a better optimization landscape for model training. We will make our code, annotated datasets, and topic classification models publicly available to facilitate further research.

Abstract: We present ONERULER, a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate long-context language models across 26 languages. ONERULER adapts the English-only RULER benchmark (Hsieh et al., 2024) by including seven synthetic tasks that test both retrieval and aggregation, including new variations of the "needle-in-a-haystack" task that allow for the possibility of a nonexistent needle. We create ONERULER through a two-step process, first writing English instructions for each task and then collaborating with native speakers to translate them into 25 additional languages. Experiments with both open-weight and closed LLMs reveal a widening performance gap between low- and high-resource languages as context length increases from 8K to 128K tokens. Surprisingly, English is not the top-performing language on long-context tasks (ranked 6th out of 26), with Polish emerging as the top language. Our experiments also show that many LLMs (particularly OpenAI's o3-mini-high) incorrectly predict the absence of an answer, even in high-resource languages. Finally, in cross-lingual scenarios where instructions and context appear in different languages, performance can fluctuate by up to 20% depending on the instruction language. We hope the release of ONERULER will facilitate future research into improving multilingual and cross-lingual long-context training pipelines.

Abstract: Since the advent of reasoning-based large language models, many have found great success from distilling reasoning capabilities into student models. Such techniques have significantly bridged the gap between reasoning and standard LLMs on coding tasks. Despite this, much of the progress on distilling reasoning models remains locked behind proprietary datasets or lacks details on data curation, filtering and subsequent training. To address this, we construct a superior supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset that we use to achieve state-of-the-art coding capability results in models of various sizes. Our distilled models use only SFT to achieve 61.8% on LiveCodeBench and 24.6% on CodeContests, surpassing alternatives trained with reinforcement learning. We then perform analysis on the data sources used to construct our dataset, the impact of code execution filtering, and the importance of instruction/solution diversity. We observe that execution filtering negatively affected benchmark accuracy, leading us to prioritize instruction diversity over solution correctness. Finally, we also analyze the token efficiency and reasoning patterns utilized by these models. We will open-source these datasets and distilled models to the community.

Abstract: Handling extremely large documents for question answering is challenging: chunk-based embedding methods often lose track of important global context, while full-context transformers can be prohibitively expensive for hundreds of thousands of tokens. We propose a single-pass document scanning approach that processes the entire text in linear time, preserving global coherence while deciding which sentences are most relevant to the query. On 41 QA benchmarks, our single-pass scanner consistently outperforms chunk-based embedding methods and competes with large language models at a fraction of the computational cost. By conditioning on the entire preceding context without chunk breaks, the method preserves global coherence, which is especially important for long documents. Overall, single-pass document scanning offers a simple solution for question answering over massive text.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is concerned with the task of removing knowledge learned from particular data points from a trained model. In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.

Abstract: While test-time reasoning enables language models (LMs) to tackle complex tasks, searching or planning in natural language can be slow, costly, and error-prone. But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for "self-steering" LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B or Qwen3-1.7B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. Our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.

Abstract: How do the latent spaces used by independently-trained LLMs relate to one another? We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.

Abstract: We study the task of automatically finding evidence relevant to hypotheses in biomedical papers. Finding relevant evidence is an important step when researchers investigate scientific hypotheses. We introduce EvidenceBench to measure models performance on this task, which is created by a novel pipeline that consists of hypothesis generation and sentence-by-sentence annotation of biomedical papers for relevant evidence, completely guided by and faithfully following existing human experts judgment. We demonstrate the pipeline's validity and accuracy with multiple sets of human-expert annotations. We evaluated a diverse set of language models and retrieval systems on the benchmark and found that model performances still fall significantly short of the expert level on this task. To show the scalability of our proposed pipeline, we create a larger EvidenceBench-100k with 107,461 fully annotated papers with hypotheses to facilitate model training and development. Both datasets are available at https://github.com/EvidenceBench/EvidenceBench

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) before extensive fine-tuning or merging can substantially reduce both computational expense and development time. Although prior approaches like scaling laws account for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they often overlook explicit lineage relationships-i.e., which models are derived or merged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes ancestral ties among LLMs via a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging multi-hop parent-child connections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional matrix factorization and collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level and benchmark-level performance prediction. Our large-scale study includes 2,934 publicly available Hugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6 major benchmarks, showing that the introduction of lineage constraints yields up to 0.15-0.30 higher Pearson correlation coefficients with actual performance compared to baseline methods. Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing accurate estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data. This lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform hyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM development.

Abstract: Textual adversarial attacks mislead NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by subtly modifying text. While effective, existing attacks often require knowledge of the victim model, extensive queries, or access to training data, limiting real-world feasibility. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which operates using only victim texts. To prevent access to the victim model, we create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and clustering methods as a foundation for developing substitute models. To address the low attack success rate (ASR) due to insufficient information feedback, we propose the hierarchical substitution model design, generating substitute models to mitigate the failure of a single substitute model at the decision boundary.
  Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with better similarity and attack effectiveness. Experiments on the Emotion and SST5 datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0. More importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious security risks. Our codes can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VDBA-Victim-Data-based-Adversarial-Attack-36EC/

Abstract: Translation-based strategies for cross-lingual transfer XLT such as translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the source language -- and translate-test -- evaluating on noisy source language data translated from the target language -- are competitive XLT baselines. In XLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label projection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word aligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design decisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been systematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which project labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after) translation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work, we revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects of low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for projecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to reduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of the translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact translation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT with WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods. We then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and translate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms the marker-based projection. Crucially, we show that our proposed ensembling also reduces sensitivity to low-level WA design choices, resulting in more robust XLT for token classification tasks.

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs) may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation manipulation techniques (CMTs) have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) - the first comprehensive benchmark designed to help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) diagnose CMTs under different context conditions. With this benchmark, we conduct the most extensive evaluation to date of seven state-of-the-art methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results reveal that most existing CMTs struggle to handle the full spectrum of context types encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. We also find that many CMTs display inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets, compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples. Our findings expose critical gaps in current CMT evaluation practices and demonstrate the need for holistic testing and the development of CMTs that can robustly handle multiple context types.

Abstract: Users interacting with large language models (LLMs) under their real identifiers often unknowingly risk disclosing private information. Automatically notifying users whether their queries leak privacy and which phrases leak what private information has therefore become a practical need. Existing privacy detection methods, however, were designed for different objectives and application domains, typically tagging personally identifiable information (PII) in anonymous content, which is insufficient in real-name interaction scenarios with LLMs. In this work, to support the development and evaluation of privacy detection models for LLM interactions that are deployable on local user devices, we construct a large-scale multilingual dataset with 249K user queries and 154K annotated privacy phrases. In particular, we build an automated privacy annotation pipeline with strong LLMs to automatically extract privacy phrases from dialogue datasets and annotate leaked information. We also design evaluation metrics at the levels of privacy leakage, extracted privacy phrase, and privacy information. We further establish baseline methods using light-weight LLMs with both tuning-free and tuning-based methods, and report a comprehensive evaluation of their performance. Evaluation results reveal a gap between current performance and the requirements of real-world LLM applications, motivating future research into more effective local privacy detection methods grounded in our dataset.

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual modality awareness during generation. This paper presents DrVoice, a parallel speech-text voice conversation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring dual-resolution speech representations. Whereas current methods utilize mainly 12.5Hz input audio representation, our proposed dual-resolution mechanism reduces the input frequency for the LLM to 5Hz. Experimental results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that D RVOICE establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among similar size speech foundation models with relative small amount of data.

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring effective reasoning to extract relevant insights. Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, model performance varies drastically across different table and context structures, making it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple prompting technique on diverse table types to determine that performance depends on factors such as entity type, table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity, with "NO" single method consistently outperforming others. To address this, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by human reasoning that dynamically adjusts to context and integrates structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves superior performance across all table types compared to baseline prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

<title>Humans overrely on overconfident language models, across languages</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey uncertainty and limitations. Prior work shows that LLMs are linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., 'I think it's') differs sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance across five languages to evaluate LLM safety in a global context. Our work finds that overreliance risks are high across languages. We first analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers and observe that LLMs are overconfident across languages, frequently generating strengtheners even as part of incorrect responses. Model generations are, however, sensitive to documented cross-linguistic variation in usage: for example, models generate the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and Mandarin. Next, we measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, participants are significantly more likely to discount expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English (i.e., ignore their 'hedging' function and rely on generations that contain them). Taken together, these results indicate a high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

<title>Pretraining on the Test Set Is No Longer All You Need: A Debate-Driven Approach to QA Benchmarks</title>

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks, concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions: (1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%) but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need," offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of advanced language models.

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts.

Abstract: We present a novel computational model employing hierarchical active inference to simulate reading and eye movements. The model characterizes linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model, facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals. In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending the cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with potential implications for understanding dyslexia in terms of maladaptive inference.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various general multimodal applications and have shown increasing promise in specialized domains. However, their potential in the insurance domain-characterized by diverse application scenarios and rich multimodal data-remains largely underexplored. To date, there is no systematic review of multimodal tasks, nor a benchmark specifically designed to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in insurance. This gap hinders the development of LVLMs within the insurance industry. This study systematically reviews and categorizes multimodal tasks for 4 representative types of insurance: auto, property, health, and agricultural. We introduce INS-MMBench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for the insurance domain. INS-MMBench encompasses 22 fundamental tasks, 12 meta-tasks and 5 scenario tasks, enabling a comprehensive and progressive assessment from basic capabilities to real-world use cases. We benchmark 11 leading LVLMs, including closed-source models such as GPT-4o and open-source models like LLaVA. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of INS-MMBench and offers detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of current LVLMs on a variety of insurance-related multimodal tasks. We hope that INS-MMBench will accelerate the integration of LVLMs into the insurance industry and foster interdisciplinary research. Our dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/FDU-INS/INS-MMBench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) solely trained on next-token prediction learn to solve a wide range of problems involving mathematical reasoning. But how does this ability evolve during training? We show the first analysis of how mathematical reasoning abilities of several open-weight LLMs develop during pre-training and post-training. To this end, we construct MathCAMPS, a synthetic dataset of novel mathematical reasoning problems grounded in 44 fine-grained skills taken from the Common Core curriculum from K to 8th grades. In one experiment, we show that mathematical skills are learned during pre-training in an order that measurably correlates with the human-designed curriculum, even though training data are randomly ordered. We also show a detailed analysis of which mathematical abilities benefit from instruction tuning, a widely used post-training method and, in contrast, which skills suffer. Our work paves the way for an empirical understanding of LLM training dynamics in relation to reasoning.

<title>Towards More Realistic Extraction Attacks: An Adversarial Perspective</title>

Abstract: Language models are prone to memorizing their training data, making them vulnerable to extraction attacks. While existing research often examines isolated setups, such as a single model or a fixed prompt, real-world adversaries have a considerably larger attack surface due to access to models across various sizes and checkpoints, and repeated prompting. In this paper, we revisit extraction attacks from an adversarial perspective -- with multi-faceted access to the underlying data. We find significant churn in extraction trends, i.e., even unintuitive changes to the prompt, or targeting smaller models and earlier checkpoints, can extract distinct information. By combining multiple attacks, our adversary doubles ($2 \times$) the extraction risks, persisting even under mitigation strategies like data deduplication. We conclude with four case studies, including detecting pre-training data, copyright violations, extracting personally identifiable information, and attacking closed-source models, showing how our more realistic adversary can outperform existing adversaries in the literature.

Abstract: Many NP-hard graph problems become easy for some classes of graphs. For example, coloring is easy for bipartite graphs, but NP-hard in general. So we can ask question like when does a hard problem become easy? What is the minimum substructure for which the problem remains hard? We use the notion of boundary classes to study such questions. In this paper, we introduce a method for transforming the boundary class of one NP-hard graph problem into a boundary class for another problem. If {\Pi} and {\Gamma} are two NP-hard graph problems where {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, we transform a boundary class of {\Pi} into a boundary class of {\Gamma}. More formally if {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, where the reduction satisfies certain conditions, then X is a boundary class of {\Pi} if and only if the image of X under the reduction is a boundary class of {\Gamma}. This gives us a relationship between boundary classes and reducibility among several NP-hard problems. To show the strength of our main result, we apply our theorem to obtain some previously unknown boundary classes for a few graph problems namely; vertex-cover, clique, traveling-salesperson, bounded-degree-spanning-tree, subgraph-isomorphism and clique-cover.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant disparity exists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We attribute this gap primarily to current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, especially in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are essential. In this paper, we introduce G-Pass@$k$, a novel evaluation metric that continuously assesses model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's performance potential and its stability. Through extensive experiments on various public and newly constructed benchmarks, we employ G-Pass@$k$ in conjunction with state-of-the-art large language models to provide comprehensive insights into their potential capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal a significant opportunity to enhance the realistic reasoning abilities of LLMs, underscoring the necessity for more robust evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Contextually Entangled Gradient Mapping (CEGM) introduces a new approach to gradient optimization, redefining the relationship between contextual embeddings and gradient updates to enhance semantic coherence and reasoning capabilities in neural architectures. By treating gradients as dynamic carriers of contextual dependencies rather than isolated numerical entities, the proposed methodology bridges critical gaps in existing optimization strategies. The integration of entangled gradient dynamics into a loss regularization framework demonstrated significant improvements in tasks involving long-form reasoning, contextual retention, and adaptability to unseen domains. Experimental evaluations showed that the CEGM-enhanced model consistently outperformed baseline approaches, achieving higher accuracy in token-level predictions and greater resilience to noisy inputs. Practical implementations involved modifications to training pipelines, introducing entanglement layers and dynamic coefficient adjustments that seamlessly align with existing architectures. Results further highlighted reductions in semantic drift during sequential transformations and improvements in embedding coherence across paraphrased sentences, showing the robustness and versatility of the proposed methodology. The findings demonstrate the broader implications of gradient entanglement for both theoretical advancements and practical applications in optimization strategies.

Abstract: Existing LLM reasoning methods have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, such as solving math and coding problems. However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o3 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains.

Abstract: We introduce Rank1, the first reranking model trained to take advantage of test-time compute. Rank1 demonstrates the applicability within retrieval of using a reasoning language model (i.e. OpenAI's o1, Deepseek's R1, etc.) for distillation in order to rapidly improve the performance of a smaller model. We gather and open-source a dataset of more than 600,000 examples of R1 reasoning traces from queries and passages in MS MARCO. Models trained on this dataset show: (1) state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning and instruction following datasets; (2) work remarkably well out of distribution due to the ability to respond to user-input prompts; and (3) have explainable reasoning chains that can be given to users or RAG-based systems. Further, we demonstrate that quantized versions of these models retain strong performance while using less compute/memory. Overall, Rank1 shows that test-time compute allows for a fundamentally new type of explainable and performant reranker model for search.

Abstract: Recent works have shown great potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robot task and motion planning (TAMP). Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

Abstract: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/CodeARC

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development by enabling code generation, automated debugging, and complex reasoning. However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.

Abstract: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety. You can find the dataset and code at https://github.com/anirudhkhatry/CRUST-bench.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers which need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established Blicket Test paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This "disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not child-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: AI-based judicial assistance and case prediction have been extensively studied in criminal and civil domains, but remain largely unexplored in consumer law, especially in India. In this paper, we present Nyay-Darpan, a novel two-in-one framework that (i) summarizes consumer case files and (ii) retrieves similar case judgements to aid decision-making in consumer dispute resolution. Our methodology not only addresses the gap in consumer law AI tools but also introduces an innovative approach to evaluate the quality of the summary. The term 'Nyay-Darpan' translates into 'Mirror of Justice', symbolizing the ability of our tool to reflect the core of consumer disputes through precise summarization and intelligent case retrieval. Our system achieves over 75 percent accuracy in similar case prediction and approximately 70 percent accuracy across material summary evaluation metrics, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We will publicly release the Nyay-Darpan framework and dataset to promote reproducibility and facilitate further research in this underexplored yet impactful domain.

<div> Keywords: Transformer-based architectures, efficient attention mechanisms, linear attention methods, sparse attention techniques, large-scale pre-trained language models

Summary:<br /><br />Transformer-based architectures are commonly used in large language models, but the quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention present challenges for long-context modeling. Recent research has introduced two types of efficient attention mechanisms to address this issue. Linear attention methods achieve linear complexity through various techniques, while sparse attention techniques limit attention computation to selected subsets of tokens to enhance efficiency. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these developments, considering algorithmic innovations and hardware-level considerations. The incorporation of efficient attention into large-scale pre-trained language models is also analyzed, including architectures using only efficient attention and hybrid designs combining local and global components. By bridging theory and practical deployment, this survey aims to be a valuable resource for advancing scalable and efficient language model design.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns, block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and efficient language models.

<div> Keywords: dialogue transcription, Large Language Models, speaker characteristics, metadata tags, speaker profiling <br />
Summary: 
Dialogue transcription pipelines commonly use Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance text quality. This study introduces a post-processing technique that enriches transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics like age, gender, and emotion, some of which may vary over time. By combining frozen audio foundation models like Whisper or WavLM with a frozen LLAMA language model, speaker attributes can be inferred without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Efficient connectors are used to bridge audio and language representations, allowing for competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while maintaining speed and modularity. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that a frozen LLAMA model can directly compare x-vectors with an impressive Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in certain scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

<div> algorithm, tokenization, NLP, Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding, language

Summary:
Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP pipelines but often favors dominant languages, resulting in inequitable tokenizations for lower-resource languages. To address this, Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm is introduced, optimizing token counts across languages without significantly affecting compression or language-model performance. By prioritizing the compression gain of underrepresented languages at each merge step, Parity-aware BPE promotes cross-lingual parity and reduces computational and financial disparities in NLP applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with  placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Summary: 
The study demonstrates that incorporating a pitch accent detection module into ASR systems utilizing semi-supervised speech representations can significantly enhance performance. The introduced joint ASR and pitch accent detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art in pitch accent detection, closing the F1-score gap by 41%. Moreover, the ASR performance shows a substantial 28.3% reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) on LibriSpeech data during joint training under limited resource fine-tuning. This suggests the importance of extending pretrained speech models to capture and retain prosodic cues like pitch accent, which can ultimately improve overall ASR system performance. <div>

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent detection model.

Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

<div> Keywords: language models, personality traits, evaluation framework, response variability, safety-critical applications

Summary: 
1. Large language models lack consistent personality traits for safe deployment.
2. The study tested 25+ open-source models across 500,000+ responses using various evaluation methods.
3. Findings show substantial response variability even in 400B+ parameter models.
4. Minor changes in prompts can significantly impact personality measurements.
5. Interventions meant to stabilize behavior may actually increase variability.
6. LLM-adapted instruments exhibit similar instability to human-centric versions.
7. The study suggests current language models lack the foundation for genuine consistency in behavior.
8. Personality-based alignment strategies may be inadequate for safety-critical applications requiring predictable behavior.
<br /><br />Summary: Large language models exhibit significant variability in personality traits, challenging assumptions about their deployment. Minor changes in prompts can have a large impact, and intervention strategies may not stabilize behavior as expected. LLM-adapted instruments show instability comparable to human-centric versions, indicating architectural limitations. This lack of consistency across scales and strategies suggests that current language models may not have the groundwork for genuine behavioral alignment. For applications requiring predictable behavior, personality-based alignment strategies may not be effective. <div>
arXiv:2508.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across 500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing, personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD > 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent, large language model, context routing, memory selection, answer quality score

Summary:
The article introduces RCR-Router, a context routing framework for multi-agent large language models (LLMs) that dynamically selects relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage while adhering to a token budget. It incorporates a scoring policy for memory selection and iteratively integrates agent outputs into a shared memory store for context refinement. The proposed Answer Quality Score metric evaluates LLM-generated explanations beyond traditional QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage by up to 30% while maintaining or improving answer quality. This highlights the significance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in enhancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

The RCR-Router framework enables efficient and adaptive collaboration in multi-agent large language models by dynamically selecting memory subsets based on agent roles and task stages. It incorporates a scoring policy for memory selection and integrates agent outputs into a shared memory store to refine context progressively. The novel Answer Quality Score metric evaluates LLM-generated explanations comprehensively. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that RCR-Router reduces token consumption while enhancing answer quality, underscoring the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing multi-agent LLM systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a benchmark to assess how well Large Language Models (LLMs) handle linguistic shibboleths, which unintentionally reveal demographic traits. By conducting simulated interviews with carefully crafted questions and responses, the study finds that LLMs tend to penalize certain language patterns, especially hedging, despite comparable content quality. The benchmark allows for controlled linguistic variations to isolate specific phenomena while maintaining semantic equivalence, facilitating the precise measurement of demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. Analysis across various linguistic dimensions reveals that hedged responses receive significantly lower ratings, on average by 25.6%. The benchmark proves effective in detecting model-specific biases and establishes a framework for identifying and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems, with wide-ranging implications for fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender, social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive 25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems, with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

Summary:
A new approach for evaluating visual activity recognition systems is proposed, taking into account the inherent ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. The framework utilizes verb sense clusters to provide a more robust evaluation by capturing synonymous verbs and different perspectives on actions in images. Analysis on the imSitu dataset shows that each image corresponds to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, representing distinct perspectives. Multiple activity recognition models are evaluated using this cluster-based approach and compared to standard evaluation methods. Human alignment analysis indicates that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements, offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance. <div>

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs. grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation, which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities, resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements, offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention strategies.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore, learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues. Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible. Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower computational costs.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled, show promise in finetuning for AMR parsing. The study evaluates the performance of four distinct LLM architectures using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Results indicate that finetuning decoder-only LLMs can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art AMR parsers. LLaMA 3.2, in particular, demonstrates competitive performance, achieving an SMATCH F1 score of 0.804 on the test split. While LLaMA 3.2 excels in semantic performance, Phi 3.5 stands out for structural validity. The findings suggest that LLMs can provide effective solutions for AMR parsing, with LLaMA 3.2 showing promise for semantic processing and Phi 3.5 for structural accuracy.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2 demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5 excels in structural validity.

Summary: The study challenges the prevailing trend of using complex multi-adapter and multi-head systems in multi-task learning for Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors show that a simplified multi-head architecture with high inter-head similarity outperforms these complex systems. They suggest that effective generalization in multi-task learning relies on learning robust shared representations rather than isolating task-specific features. Introducing Align-LoRA, which aligns task representations within the shared adapter space, leads to significant performance improvements over all baselines. The findings propose a simpler yet more effective approach for adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. <div>

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA, which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for adapting LLMs to multiple tasks.

Summary:
The article introduces "MultiCheck," a framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification that addresses the challenge of multimodal misinformation. The framework combines text and image encoders with a fusion module for cross-modal relationships and a classification head for veracity prediction. A contrastive learning objective promotes semantic alignment in a shared latent space. Tested on the Factify 2 dataset, MultiCheck achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.84, significantly surpassing the baseline. The results demonstrate the efficacy of explicit multimodal reasoning in fact-checking. This approach shows promise for scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called "MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals. Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions. A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

<div> entropy engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, balanced entropy, attention dynamics, zero-shot inference

Summary: 
The paper introduces the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework to address the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models due to long context lengths. By focusing on entropy invariance, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring stable entropy levels. The framework incorporates a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to find the optimal balance factor for different contexts. Through extensive experiments across various RAG tasks, the effectiveness of BEE-RAG in improving adaptability to varying context lengths is demonstrated. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Attention Basin, Attention-Driven Reranking, Multi-hop QA, Few-shot Learning

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a positional bias in their attention mechanism, known as the attention basin, where they prioritize information at the beginning and end of a sequence. This bias can impact performance, as critical information in the middle may be overlooked. To address this, the authors propose AttnRank, a model-agnostic method that leverages intrinsic positional attention preferences to reorder input sequences. AttnRank consists of two stages: calibration of attention preferences and reordering of inputs to align salient content with high-attention positions. The approach is training-free, plug-and-play, and computationally efficient. Through experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot learning tasks, AttnRank demonstrates significant performance improvements across various LLM architectures and scales without the need for modifying model parameters or training procedures. <div>

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples), models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i) estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence, often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge. PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs) further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy (Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a "Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Summary:
Structured pruning is a key technique for compressing large language models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency in real-world applications. Current methods focus on the importance of individual units, potentially disrupting the macro functional architecture of LLMs. This study proposes a novel approach inspired by functional brain networks, identifying and preserving key neurons within functional networks in LLMs. By treating an LLM as a digital brain and decomposing it into functional networks, the method successfully prunes LLMs while maintaining functionality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach in locating functional networks and key neurons for efficient model compression. The code for this method is publicly available, offering a valuable resource for further research and application.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation. Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Summary:
CodeBoost is a novel post-training framework for enhancing code large language models (LLMs) using code snippets instead of human-annotated instructions. It introduces several key components to improve model performance: maximum-clique curation for selecting representative training data, bi-directional prediction for learning from both forward and backward objectives, error-aware prediction for incorporating signals from correct and incorrect outputs, heterogeneous augmentation for diversifying training distribution, and heterogeneous rewarding for guiding model learning through multiple reward types. Experimental results show that CodeBoost consistently enhances performance across various code LLMs and benchmarks, making it a scalable and effective training pipeline for improving code LLMs without the need for labor-intensive human annotations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand, code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenge of reliability in reasoning chains generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Contrary to the "cascading failure" hypothesis, the study identifies a phenomenon termed "Late-Stage Fragility," where errors in later stages of reasoning chains have a higher likelihood of corrupting the final answer. To address this vulnerability, the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method is introduced, incorporating an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) and Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM assigns different weights based on the position in the reasoning chain to prioritize late-stage steps, while the MSCE applies robust correction to failure points. Experiments on benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH show that ASCoT outperforms standard CoT, emphasizing the need for adaptive correction mechanisms in LLM reasoning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.

<div> Keywords: meta-reviewing, dialogue agents, large language models, decision-making, synthetic data 

Summary: 
Meta-reviewing, the final step in the peer-review process, involves decision-making based on weighing reviewer arguments and contextualizing them. Prior research has shown that dialogue agents can effectively assist decision-makers in such scenarios. This study addresses the challenge of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) through a self-refinement strategy. The experiments demonstrate that this method yields higher-quality synthetic data, which can be valuable for training meta-reviewing assistants. The trained dialogue agents, customized for meta-reviewing, outperform generic LLM-based assistants in the task. Moreover, when applied in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios, these agents are shown to enhance the efficiency of the process. The practical challenges of realizing dialogue agents for meta-reviewing are successfully addressed in this study, showcasing the potential for improved decision-making support in the peer-review process.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely, we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform \emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data: https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-meta-review-as-dialog

We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster reproducibility and future research.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Language Models, Reflection Behaviors, Overthinking, Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression, Token Usage Reduction<br />
Summary:
Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS) is introduced to address the problem of overthinking in Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs). These models often have complex reflection behaviors triggered by specific words, leading to redundant reasoning steps. CGRS dynamically suppresses the generation of reflection triggers when the model is confident in its response, thus reducing unnecessary token usage without compromising accuracy. It is a model-agnostic approach that can be seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive generation pipelines without the need for retraining. Experimental results across various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness in reducing token usage by 18.5% to 41.9% while maintaining accuracy. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in achieving a balance between length reduction and performance, across different model architectures and scales. CGRS proves to be a practical solution for enhancing the efficiency of reasoning in LRLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance. However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy. It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3 family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value for efficient reasoning.

Summary: 
This study explores the impact of adding adjustment features to a sign language avatar on the Microsoft Hololens 2, focusing on German Sign Language users. The findings show that while users preferred adjustable settings, no significant improvements in user experience or comprehensibility were observed. Issues such as missing sign language elements, implementation problems, and high stress levels with the adjustable avatar were identified. Users rated the system higher in hedonic quality than pragmatic quality, indicating more emotional appeal than functional usefulness. Concerns were raised about the intuitiveness of Hololens adjustment gestures. Acceptability of adjustability was positive but dependent on usability and animation quality. Recommendations include enhancing facial and mouthing animation, improving interaction interfaces, and involving users in the design process. This study underscores the importance of ensuring sign language avatars are inherently comprehensible and user-friendly.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2 device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality, indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration. Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory design.

Summary:
The study focuses on the use of Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems for domain-specific professional search, particularly in biomedical research. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge is used as a testing ground for expert-formulated questions. Current reasoning and nonreasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini, and DeepSeek-R1 are examined for their performance. A self-feedback mechanism is implemented where LLMs generate, evaluate, and refine their outputs for query expansion and different answer types. The study assesses whether iterative self-correction improves performance and compares the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in professional search systems. Preliminary results show varied performance across models and tasks, providing insights into LLM self-correction and guiding future research in this area.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types (yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these search systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Cultural biases, MyCulture benchmark, Bahasa Melayu, Open-ended format

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. To address this issue, the MyCulture benchmark is introduced to evaluate LLMs on Malaysian culture across six pillars in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike traditional benchmarks, MyCulture uses an open-ended multiple-choice question format to reduce guessing and format bias. This format also improves fairness and discriminative power. The study analyzes structural and language bias in LLMs' performance, revealing significant disparities in cultural comprehension among different models. The results emphasize the necessity of culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks for the development and assessment of LLMs.

arXiv:2508.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment, food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks, MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in the development and assessment of LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, LLMEval-3, dynamic evaluation, data contamination, performance ceiling <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces LLMEval-3, a framework for dynamic evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing static benchmarks are prone to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, which obscure true model capabilities. LLMEval-3 addresses these issues by using a bank of graduate-level questions to dynamically sample unseen test sets for evaluation runs. It includes an anti-cheating architecture and a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process that achieves 90% agreement with human experts. A 20-month longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models using LLMEval-3 reveals a performance ceiling on knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities. The framework demonstrates exceptional ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical validation for dynamic evaluation. LLMEval-3 offers a robust methodology for assessing LLM capabilities beyond leaderboard scores, aiming to promote the development of more trustworthy evaluation standards. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3, a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts, complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation standards.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained, token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding, spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/cyzcz/Tase .

Summary: 
Creativity metrics such as the creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and LLM-as-a-Judge were examined and compared across various creative domains. The analysis found that these measures capture different aspects of creativity and exhibit limitations. The creativity index focuses on lexical diversity, while perplexity is sensitive to model confidence. Syntactic templates struggle to capture conceptual creativity, and LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. The study emphasizes the need for more robust evaluation frameworks that align better with human perceptions of creativity. This research sheds light on the diverse dimensions of creativity and underlines the importance of developing comprehensive and reliable methods to assess creativity in different domains. <div>

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing, unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally, LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human judgments of creativity.

<div> knowledge augmentation, Logic-Augmented Generation, reasoning, question decomposition, retrieval-augmented generation

Summary: 
Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG) is introduced as a new paradigm inspired by Cartesian principles to improve the performance of large language models in knowledge-intensive tasks. LAG enhances reasoning robustness by systematically decomposing complex questions into atomic sub-questions based on logical dependencies. It sequentially resolves these sub-questions, using prior answers for context retrieval and incorporating a logical termination mechanism to prevent error propagation. LAG significantly reduces hallucination and aligns problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to existing retrieval-augmented generation systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from \textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically, LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to existing RAG systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, implicit biases, geographic disparities, entity deduction, 20 Questions game

Summary: <br /><br />Large Language Models (LLMs) have been studied for implicit biases through a proactive questioning approach in the 20 Questions game. A new dataset, Geo20Q+, was used to evaluate geographic performance differences in entity deduction across different regions. LLMs showed higher success rates in deducing entities from the Global North and West compared to the South and East. Factors such as Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency partially accounted for these disparities. Language variations had minimal impact on performance gaps. By analyzing the reasoning processes of LLMs in multi-turn interactions, the study uncovered geographic and cultural biases in their deduction processes. The released dataset (Geo20Q+) and code provide valuable resources for further research into bias mitigation strategies in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese, French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps. These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, Legal domain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, context-aware decoding, CoCoLex

Summary: 
CoCoLex is a new decoding strategy for Legal Text Generation that aims to address the issue of unfaithful outputs from large language models (LLMs) in the Legal domain. It dynamically interpolates the model's output with a distribution derived from copying directly from the context, based on the model's confidence. This approach ensures greater fidelity to the source material, improving the overall quality of generated text. Experimental results on five legal benchmarks show that CoCoLex outperforms existing context-aware decoding methods, particularly in tasks requiring long-form generation. This innovative strategy has the potential to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in the Legal domain, making them more reliable and accurate for processing complex legal contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

Summary: <br />
The study proposes a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method for Large Language Models (LLMs) in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) to address their unreliability. The method leverages conformal prediction (CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees under black-box settings. By sampling multiple outputs of the LLMs and calculating the most frequent sample as a reference to determine predictive entropy (PE), the approach outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions. Experimental evaluations across different LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-based PE in controlling the miscoverage rate under specified risk levels. The method serves as a reliable uncertainty quantification framework for MCQA, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability, such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy (PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA, MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Summary: 
1. Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions across various socio-cultural contexts.
2. The study examines whether these differences exist in multilingual large language models (MLLMs) across five Western languages.
3. MLLMs were prompted to report their agreement or disagreement with political statements to evaluate their opinions.
4. The research finds that unaligned models exhibit minimal cross-lingual differences in political opinions, suggesting opinions transfer between languages in Western contexts.
5. Political alignment of MLLMs shifts opinions uniformly across all languages, highlighting the difficulty in achieving explicit socio-linguistic, cultural, and political alignment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic, cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

Summary:
MathSmith is a novel framework for generating challenging mathematical problems to improve Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning abilities. It creates new problems from scratch by randomly sampling concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath to ensure data independence. Nine predefined strategies are used as constraints to increase difficulty, and reinforcement learning optimizes validity, complexity, and consistency of answers. The length of the reasoning trace reflects cognitive complexity, encouraging the creation of more demanding problems. MathSmith outperforms existing baselines in easy, medium, and hard benchmarks, demonstrating scalability and transferability. A variant generation module allows targeted improvement on specific concepts. Overall, this approach shows promise in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities through high-difficulty synthetic data synthesis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality, high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability. We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity, encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks, categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts. Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, reinforcement learning, Cooper framework, reward hacking, reference-based reward modeling

Summary:
Cooper is a novel reinforcement learning framework that co-optimizes policy and reward models to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). By combining rule-based and model-based rewards, Cooper improves robustness and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. The framework dynamically constructs positive-negative sample pairs for reward model training, leveraging the precision of rule-based rewards. An efficient hybrid annotation strategy is introduced to generate training data for the reward model. A reference-based reward modeling paradigm, implemented through VerifyRM, achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench. Experiments demonstrate that Cooper effectively combats reward hacking and improves end-to-end RL performance, showing a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. These findings highlight the importance of dynamically updating reward models in RL for enhanced performance and robustness. 

<br /><br />Summary: Cooper framework optimizes policy and reward models for LLMs, addressing reward hacking and improving performance. It combines rule-based and model-based rewards, dynamically constructs training pairs, and employs a reference-based reward modeling paradigm with VerifyRM for higher accuracy.

arXiv:2508.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues, we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking, providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

<div> framework, language models, embodied agent reasoning, physical interactions, tool usage

Summary:
OmniEAR introduces a framework for evaluating language models on embodied agent reasoning in physical tasks. The framework requires models to dynamically acquire capabilities and determine coordination strategies autonomously. The study evaluates models across 1,500 scenarios in household and industrial domains, revealing performance degradation when models must reason from constraints. While models perform well with explicit instructions, their performance drops significantly for tool reasoning and implicit collaboration tasks. Surprisingly, providing complete environmental information hinders coordination performance, indicating models struggle to filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks but has minimal impact on multi-agent coordination, highlighting architectural limitations in current models. OmniEAR sets a rigorous benchmark for advancing embodied AI systems. The code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Factuality, FActScore, Hallucination rate  
Summary:  
A new approach for improving factual reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is presented in this study. While LLMs have shown great success in reasoning tasks, they often struggle with factuality and generate more hallucinations than non-reasoning models in long-form factuality benchmarks. The challenge lies in extending online RL, a key component in recent LLM advancements, to the factuality setting due to the lack of reliable verification methods. By proposing a novel reward function that considers factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, the model learns to produce high-quality factual reasoning. Evaluation on six factuality benchmarks shows a significant reduction in hallucination rate, an increase in answer detail level, and no decline in response helpfulness. This approach addresses issues of reward hacking and leads to improved factual reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Summary: 
- The study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can persuade humans in multi-turn conversations.
- Linear probes, simple tools for analyzing model representations, are used to study persuasion dynamics in conversations.
- Probes trained on persuasion aspects such as persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy can capture various aspects of persuasion.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy. Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches, probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

<div> Keywords: Byte-level language models, morphologically-rich languages, H-NET++, Transformer context-mixer, Persian corpus<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model designed to address computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages. The model leverages a lightweight Transformer context-mixer and a two-level latent hyper-prior to learn linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Specialized handling of orthographic artifacts like the Persian ZWNJ and curriculum-based training with staged sequence lengths further enhance the model's performance.

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts (e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.

Summary: 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve shifted its communication focus to financial stability, market volatility, social welfare, and unconventional monetary policy, with a notable context of uncertainty. Compared to past crises, the Fed's responses were more reactive during the pandemic. Declining sentiment in financial stability discussions predicted accommodative monetary policy decisions. Communication on unconventional monetary policy has become common since the Global Financial Crisis, showing an institutional shift in communication strategies post-crisis. This study highlights the evolution of central bank communication during crises and how strategies adapt to unique economic circumstances. <div>

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability, combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability, market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic circumstances.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive, intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS: (1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2) a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM), specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of 0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device, eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on detecting hate speech on social media using transformer-based models and the MetaHate dataset.
- Traditional deep learning approaches like RNNs and CNNs have limitations in detecting hate speech due to long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization.
- Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA were evaluated, with fine-tuned ELECTRA performing the best with an F1 score of 0.8980.
- Classification errors were analyzed, highlighting challenges with sarcasm, coded language, and label noise in hate speech detection.
- Hate speech, including slurs and defamatory posts, is a serious issue on social media platforms and has been linked to real-world hate crimes. <div>

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse, encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social, psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication, they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded language, and label noise.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Summary:
Simultaneous Speech Translation systems face the challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. The strategy introduced in this study involves waiting for more input only if it provides additional information. The Regularized Entropy Information Adaptation (REINA) loss is utilized to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model, pushing the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff. The study achieves state-of-the-art streaming results for French, Spanish, and German translations to and from English, using only open-source or synthetic data. A metric for streaming efficiency is introduced, showing that REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by up to 21% compared to previous approaches. This improvement is normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Summary:  
The article introduces R-Zero, an autonomous framework that generates its own training data. It starts with a base Large Language Model and creates two models, a Challenger and a Solver, which interact and co-evolve. The Challenger proposes tasks at the edge of the Solver capability, rewarding both models for their performance. This process creates a targeted, self-improving curriculum without the need for pre-existing tasks or labels. Empirical results show significant improvements in reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, with boosts in math-reasoning benchmarks and general-domain reasoning benchmarks. R-Zero represents a novel approach to training Large Language Models that could advance AI systems beyond human intelligence.

arXiv:2508.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Summary:
This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for spatial data integration in urban environments. Traditional rule-based methods often require manual verification, while machine learning approaches need extensive labeling of task-specific samples. LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities but struggle with connecting macro-scale environments with computational geometry tasks. However, when given relevant features, LLMs can produce high-performing results. A review-and-refine method is effective in correcting initial errors while maintaining accuracy. The practical implications of using LLMs in real-world scenarios are discussed, with future research directions including post-training techniques, multi-modal integration methods, and support for various data formats. Overall, LLMs offer a promising and flexible alternative to traditional rule-based heuristics, improving adaptive spatial data integration.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets. Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases, requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning, LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive spatial data integration.

<div> keywords: LLM, pipelines, prompt management, runtime control, structured data<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new language and runtime system called SPEAR to address the limitations of traditional prompt management in large language model (LLM) pipelines. The current prompt management system is inflexible and disconnected from the dataflow, hindering reuse, optimization, and runtime control. SPEAR aims to make prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components in the execution model. It enables runtime prompt refinement, allowing prompts to be modified dynamically based on execution-time signals, and structured prompt management, organizing prompt fragments into versioned views. Additionally, SPEAR defines a prompt algebra to govern prompt construction and adaptation, supports various refinement modes to balance control and automation, and enables prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion. Preliminary experiments show the benefits of different refinement modes and prompt-level optimizations, demonstrating the potential of SPEAR in improving LLM pipeline performance. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.05012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process -- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual, assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse. Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances, a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding using Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2 cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token usage).

<title>JPS: Jailbreak Multimodal Large Language Models with Collaborative Visual Perturbation and Textual Steering</title>

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS, \underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass, complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with analyses confirming its efficacy.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to benefit the community.

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers -- demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly, we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance, re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks, providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for low-resource languages and multilinguality.

<title>Aligning LLMs on a Budget: Inference-Time Alignment with Heuristic Reward Models</title>

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets, HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

<title>Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

<title>QA-Dragon: Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores, outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&amp;P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

Abstract: Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs. Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge. To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats. For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by 32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.

<title>A Novel Architecture for Symbolic Reasoning with Decision Trees and LLM Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05311</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system. Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On \textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles. Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust, interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape. This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities, such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios, including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and more compliant AI.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small, resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement. Our dataset can be found at https://opendatalab.com/applyMultilingualCorpus.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time. This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities (measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other agent allocation models.

SPGISpeech 2.0 improves the diversity of applicable modeling tasks while maintaining the core characteristic of the original SPGISpeech dataset: audio snippets and their corresponding fully formatted text transcriptions, usable for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). SPGISpeech 2.0 consists of 3,780 additional hours of professionally transcribed earnings calls. Furthermore, the dataset contains call and speaker information for each audio snippet facilitating multi-talker ASR. We validate the utility of SPGISpeech 2.0 through improvements in speaker-tagged ASR performance of popular speech recognition models after fine-tuning on SPGISpeech 2.0. Released free for non-commercial use, we expect SPGISpeech 2.0 to foster advancements in speech recognition technologies and inspire a wide range of research applications.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models, where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model), and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$, the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically, our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$ outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs, coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: The success of pre-trained contextualized representations has prompted researchers to analyze them for the presence of linguistic information. Indeed, it is natural to assume that these pre-trained representations do encode some level of linguistic knowledge as they have brought about large empirical improvements on a wide variety of NLP tasks, which suggests they are learning true linguistic generalization. In this work, we focus on intrinsic probing, an analysis technique where the goal is not only to identify whether a representation encodes a linguistic attribute but also to pinpoint where this attribute is encoded. We propose a novel latent-variable formulation for constructing intrinsic probes and derive a tractable variational approximation to the log-likelihood. Our results show that our model is versatile and yields tighter mutual information estimates than two intrinsic probes previously proposed in the literature. Finally, we find empirical evidence that pre-trained representations develop a cross-lingually entangled notion of morphosyntax.

<title>Probabilities of Chat LLMs Are Miscalibrated but Still Predict Correctness on Multiple-Choice Q&amp;A</title>

Abstract: We study 15 large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for chat and find that their maximum softmax probabilities (MSPs) are consistently miscalibrated on multiple-choice Q&amp;A. However, those MSPs might still encode useful uncertainty information. Specifically, we hypothesized that wrong answers would be associated with smaller MSPs compared to correct answers. Via rigorous statistical testing, we show that this hypothesis holds for models which perform well on the underlying Q&amp;A task. We also find a strong direction correlation between Q&amp;A accuracy and MSP correctness prediction, while finding no correlation between Q&amp;A accuracy and calibration error. This suggests that within the current fine-tuning paradigm, we can expect correctness prediction but not calibration to improve as LLM capabilities progress. To demonstrate the utility of correctness prediction, we show that when models have the option to abstain, performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response, using only a small amount of labeled data to choose the MSP threshold.

<title>Understanding Large Language Model Behaviors through Interactive Counterfactual Generation and Analysis</title>

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safe and reliable use. However, existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for LLMs primarily rely on word-level explanations, which are often computationally inefficient and misaligned with human reasoning processes. Moreover, these methods often treat explanation as a one-time output, overlooking its inherently interactive and iterative nature. In this paper, we present LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization system that addresses these limitations by enabling intuitive and efficient exploration of LLM behaviors through counterfactual analysis. Our system features a novel algorithm that generates fluent and semantically meaningful counterfactuals via targeted removal and replacement operations at user-defined levels of granularity. These counterfactuals are used to compute feature attribution scores, which are then integrated with concrete examples in a table-based visualization, supporting dynamic analysis of model behavior. A user study with LLM practitioners and interviews with experts demonstrate the system's usability and effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of involving humans in the explanation process as active participants rather than passive recipients.

<title>CrisisSense-LLM: Instruction Fine-Tuned Large Language Model for Multi-label Social Media Text Classification in Disaster Informatics</title>

Abstract: In the field of crisis/disaster informatics, social media is increasingly being used for improving situational awareness to inform response and relief efforts. Efficient and accurate text classification tools have been a focal area of investigation in crisis informatics. However, current methods mostly rely on single-label text classification models, which fails to capture different insights embedded in dynamic and multifaceted disaster-related social media data. This study introduces a novel approach to disaster text classification by enhancing a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) through instruction fine-tuning targeted for multi-label classification of disaster-related tweets. Our methodology involves creating a comprehensive instruction dataset from disaster-related tweets, which is then used to fine-tune an open-source LLM, thereby embedding it with disaster-specific knowledge. This fine-tuned model can classify multiple aspects of disaster-related information simultaneously, such as the type of event, informativeness, and involvement of human aid, significantly improving the utility of social media data for situational awareness in disasters. The results demonstrate that this approach enhances the categorization of critical information from social media posts, thereby facilitating a more effective deployment for situational awareness during emergencies. This research paves the way for more advanced, adaptable, and robust disaster management tools, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to improve real-time situational awareness and response strategies in disaster scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have convincing performance in a variety of downstream tasks. However, these systems are prone to generating undesirable outputs such as harmful and biased text. In order to remedy such generations, the development of guardrail (or detector) models has gained traction. Motivated by findings from developing a detector for social bias, we adopt the notion of a use-mention distinction - which we identified as the primary source of under-performance in the preliminary versions of our social bias detector. Armed with this information, we describe a fully extensible and reproducible synthetic data generation pipeline which leverages taxonomy-driven instructions to create targeted and labeled data. Using this pipeline, we generate over 300K unique contrastive samples and provide extensive experiments to systematically evaluate performance on a suite of open source datasets. We show that our method achieves competitive performance with a fraction of the cost in compute and offers insight into iteratively developing efficient and capable guardrail models.
  Warning: This paper contains examples of text which are toxic, biased, and potentially harmful.

Abstract: Building high-quality datasets for specialized tasks is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that often requires specialized domain knowledge. We propose Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning (CRAFT), a method for generating synthetic datasets, given a small number of user-written few-shots that demonstrate the task to be performed. Given these examples, CRAFT uses large-scale public web-crawled corpora and similarity-based document retrieval to find other relevant human-written documents. Lastly, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) augment the retrieved documents into custom-formatted task samples, which then can be used for fine-tuning. We demonstrate that CRAFT can efficiently generate large-scale task-specific training datasets for four diverse tasks: biology, medicine, and commonsense question-answering (QA), as well as summarization. Our experiments show that CRAFT-based models outperform or match general LLMs on QA tasks, while exceeding models trained on human-curated summarization data by 46 preference points. CRAFT outperforms other synthetic dataset generation methods such as Self- and Evol-Instruct, and remains robust even when the quality of the initial few-shots varies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing tasks, yet their internal knowledge structures remain poorly understood. This study examines these structures through the lens of historical Olympic medal tallies, evaluating LLMs on two tasks: (1) retrieving medal counts for specific teams and (2) identifying rankings of each team. While state-of-the-art LLMs excel in recalling medal counts, they struggle with providing rankings, highlighting a key difference between their knowledge organization and human reasoning. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLMs' internal knowledge integration and suggest directions for improvement. To facilitate further research, we release our code, dataset, and model outputs.

Abstract: Integrating named entity recognition (NER) with automatic speech recognition (ASR) can significantly enhance transcription accuracy and informativeness. In this paper, we introduce WhisperNER, a novel model that allows joint speech transcription and entity recognition. WhisperNER supports open-type NER, enabling recognition of diverse and evolving entities at inference. Building on recent advancements in open NER research, we augment a large synthetic dataset with synthetic speech samples. This allows us to train WhisperNER on a large number of examples with diverse NER tags. During training, the model is prompted with NER labels and optimized to output the transcribed utterance along with the corresponding tagged entities. To evaluate WhisperNER, we generate synthetic speech for commonly used NER benchmarks and annotate existing ASR datasets with open NER tags. Our experiments demonstrate that WhisperNER outperforms natural baselines on both out-of-domain open type NER and supervised finetuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are starting to complement traditional information seeking mechanisms such as web search. LLM-powered chatbots like ChatGPT are gaining prominence among the general public. AI chatbots are also increasingly producing content on social media platforms. However, LLMs are also prone to hallucinations, generating plausible yet factually incorrect or fabricated information. This becomes a critical problem when laypeople start seeking information about sensitive issues such as healthcare. Existing works in LLM hallucinations in the medical domain mainly focus on testing the medical knowledge of LLMs through standardized medical exam questions which are often well-defined and clear-cut with definitive answers. However, these approaches may not fully capture how these LLMs perform during real-world interactions with patients. This work conducts a pioneering study on hallucinations in LLM-generated responses to real-world healthcare queries from patients.We introduce MedHalu, a novel medical hallucination benchmark featuring diverse health-related topics and hallucinated responses from LLMs, with detailed annotation of the hallucination types and text spans. We also propose MedHaluDetect, a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs' abilities to detect hallucinations. Furthermore, we study the vulnerability to medical hallucinations among three groups -- medical experts, LLMs, and laypeople. Notably, LLMs significantly underperform human experts and, in some cases, even laypeople in detecting medical hallucinations. To improve hallucination detection, we propose an expert-in-the-loop approach that integrates expert reasoning into LLM inputs, significantly improving hallucination detection for all LLMs, including a 6.3% macro-F1 improvement for GPT-4.

Abstract: While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, primarily for their capabilities in text-based interactions. However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative. This survey paper provides the first comprehensive overview of recent methodologies for constructing SpeechLMs, detailing the key components of their architecture and the various training recipes integral to their development. Additionally, we systematically survey the various capabilities of SpeechLMs, categorize their evaluation metrics, and discuss the challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across a range of tasks, mathematical reasoning remains a challenging frontier. Motivated by the observation that humans learn more effectively when prompted not what to think but how to think, we introduce BloomWise, a cognitively-inspired prompting technique designed to enhance LLMs' performance on mathematical problem solving while making their solutions more explainable. BloomWise encourages LLMs to generate solutions - in the form of explanations - by progressing through a sequence of cognitive operations-from basic (e.g., remembering) to more advanced reasoning skills (e.g., evaluating) - mirroring how humans build understanding. The process iterates through these levels, halting early if a convergence criterion is met: specifically, if two or more consecutive levels yield the same answer, the solution from the earliest such level is output; otherwise, the process continues until all levels are completed. Through extensive experiments across five popular math reasoning datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BloomWise. We also present comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the strengths of each component within our system.

Abstract: Post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective in reducing the memory and computational requirements for inference. In this study, we focus on a straightforward question: When aiming for a target accuracy or perplexity with low-precision quantization, how much high-precision computation needs to be preserved, and how fine-grained this quantization would need to be as we scale LLMs to larger sizes? We first introduce two critical metrics, named the quantization ratio ($Q_r$) and quantization block size ($Q_b$). The former measures the number of parameters quantized to low-precision arithmetic normalized by the total parameter count, whereas the latter defines the number of values within a block that share a scaling factor, akin to the block size concept introduced in the FP4 format in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. Through extensive and carefully controlled experiments across different models and quantization methods, we propose a unified scaling law on post-training quantization (PTQ) that can predict loss degeneration for varying $Q_r$ and $Q_b$. For $Q_r$, our scaling law implies that parameter scaling and ratio scaling have a multiplicative relationship. Consequently, larger models are more amenable to a higher quantization ratio $Q_r$, thus supporting an increase in the adoption of mixed quantization for inference. Regarding $Q_b$, our findings indicate that a small block size, similar to that used in Blackwell, is not essential for large models. Employing a small $Q_b$ can instead unnecessarily complicate the design of the hardware circuit.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the data preparation pipeline developed for the OpenGPT-X project, a large-scale initiative aimed at creating open and high-performance multilingual large language models (LLMs). The project goal is to deliver models that cover all major European languages, with a particular focus on real-world applications within the European Union. We explain all data processing steps, starting with the data selection and requirement definition to the preparation of the final filtered data. We distinguish between curated data and web data, as each of these categories is handled by distinct pipelines, with curated data undergoing minimal filtering and web data requiring extensive filtering and deduplication. This distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions for both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we provide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and alignment with European data regulations. Finally, we share key insights and challenges faced during the project, offering recommendations for future endeavors in large-scale multilingual data preparation for LLMs.

Abstract: Existing fairness benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on simple tasks, such as multiple-choice questions, overlooking biases that may arise in more complex scenarios like long-text generation. To address this gap, we introduce the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a framework that evaluates biases in LLMs through essay-style prompts. LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10 demographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By assessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers subtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses. In our evaluation of five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMa3, we identify two key patterns of bias. First, these models frequently favor certain demographic groups in their responses. Second, they show excessive sensitivity toward traditionally disadvantaged groups, often providing overly protective responses while neglecting others. To mitigate these biases, we propose FT-REGARD, a finetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses. FT-REGARD reduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves performance by 1.4 percentage points on the BBQ benchmark, offering a promising approach to addressing biases in long-text generation tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection on text-rich graphs is widely prevalent in real life, such as detecting incorrectly assigned academic papers to authors and detecting bots in social networks. The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) pave a new revenue by utilizing rich-text information for effective anomaly detection. However, simply introducing rich texts into LLMs can obscure essential detection cues and introduce high fine-tuning costs. Moreover, LLMs often overlook the intrinsic structural bias of graphs which is vital for distinguishing normal from abnormal node patterns. To this end, this paper introduces GuARD, a text-rich and graph-informed language model that combines key structural features from graph-based methods with fine-grained semantic attributes extracted via small language models for effective anomaly detection on text-rich graphs. GuARD is optimized with the progressive multi-modal multi-turn instruction tuning framework in the task-guided instruction tuning regime tailed to incorporate both rich-text and structural modalities. Extensive experiments on four datasets reveal that GuARD outperforms graph-based and LLM-based anomaly detection methods, while offering up to 5$\times$ times speedup in training and 5$\times$ times speedup in inference over vanilla long-context LLMs on the large-scale WhoIsWho dataset.

Abstract: In many practical applications, large language models (LLMs) need to acquire new knowledge not present in their pre-training data. Efficiently leveraging this knowledge usually relies on supervised fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Although RAG has emerged as the industry standard for knowledge injection, fine-tuning has not yet achieved comparable success. This paper proposes utilizing prompt distillation, a self-distillation-based method previously explored primarily for style alignment and instruction tuning, to internalize new factual knowledge from free-form documents. Unlike prior methods, our approach requires neither larger teacher models nor structured knowledge formats. Across multiple LLM sizes and model families, we show that prompt distillation outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning and can even surpass RAG. We analyze the key factors contributing to prompt distillation's effectiveness and examine how it scales.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.

<title>Can open source large language models be used for tumor documentation in Germany? -- An evaluation on urological doctors' notes</title>

Abstract: Tumor documentation in Germany is largely done manually, requiring reading patient records and entering data into structured databases. Large language models (LLMs) could potentially enhance this process by improving efficiency and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the tumor documentation process: identifying tumor diagnoses, assigning ICD-10 codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors' notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks. Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available from https://github.com/stefan-m-lenz/UroLlmEval. We also release the dataset as a new valuable resource that addresses the shortage of authentic and easily accessible benchmarks in German-language medical NLP.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align with user preferences is challenging due to the high cost of quality human annotations in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and the generalizability limitations of AI Feedback. To address these challenges, we propose RLTHF, a human-AI hybrid framework that combines LLM-based initial alignment with selective human annotations to achieve full-human annotation alignment with minimal effort. RLTHF identifies hard-to-annotate samples mislabeled by LLMs using a reward model's reward distribution and iteratively enhances alignment by integrating strategic human corrections while leveraging LLM's correctly labeled samples. Evaluations on HH-RLHF and TL;DR datasets show that RLTHF reaches full-human annotation-level alignment with only 6-7% of the human annotation effort. Furthermore, models trained on RLTHF's curated datasets for downstream tasks outperform those trained on fully human-annotated datasets, underscoring the effectiveness of RLTHF.

<title>Which Questions Improve Learning the Most? Utility Estimation of Questions with LM-based Simulations</title>

Abstract: Asking good questions is critical for comprehension and learning, yet evaluating and generating such questions remains a challenging problem. Prior work on inquisitive questions focuses on learner-generated, curiosity-driven queries and evaluates them using indirect metrics, such as salience or information gain, that do not directly capture a question's impact on actual learning outcomes. We introduce QUEST (Question Utility Estimation with Simulated Tests), a framework that uses language models to simulate learners and directly quantify the utility of a question - its contribution to exam performance. QUEST simulates a learner who asks questions and receives answers while studying a textbook chapter, then uses them to take an end-of-chapter exam. Through this simulation, the utility of each question is estimated by its direct effect on exam performance, rather than inferred indirectly based on the underlying content. To support this evaluation, we curate TEXTBOOK-EXAM, a benchmark that aligns textbook sections with end-of-section exam questions across five academic disciplines. Using QUEST, we filter for high-utility questions and fine-tune question generators via rejection sampling. Experiments show that questions generated by QUEST-trained models improve simulated test scores by over 20% compared to strong baselines that are fine-tuned using indirect metrics or leverage prompting methods. Furthermore, utility is only weakly correlated with salience and similarity to exam questions, suggesting that it captures unique signal that benefits downstream performance. QUEST offers a new outcome-driven paradigm for question evaluation and generation - one that moves beyond question-answer content toward measurable improvements in learning outcomes.

<title>Language Model Uncertainty Quantification with Attention Chain</title>

Abstract: Accurately quantifying a large language model's (LLM) predictive uncertainty is crucial for judging the reliability of its answers. While most existing research focuses on short, directly answerable questions with closed-form outputs (e.g., multiple-choice), involving intermediate reasoning steps in LLM responses is increasingly important. This added complexity complicates uncertainty quantification (UQ) because the probabilities assigned to answer tokens are conditioned on a vast space of preceding reasoning tokens. Direct marginalization is infeasible, and the dependency inflates probability estimates, causing overconfidence in UQ. To address this, we propose UQAC, an efficient method that narrows the reasoning space to a tractable size for marginalization. UQAC iteratively constructs an "attention chain" of tokens deemed "semantically crucial" to the final answer via a backtracking procedure. Starting from the answer tokens, it uses attention weights to identify the most influential predecessors, then iterates this process until reaching the input tokens. The resulting chain is further refined with similarity filtering and probability thresholding, which reduce the reasoning space, facilitating the approximation of the marginal answer token probabilities. We validate UQAC on multiple reasoning benchmarks with advanced open-source LLMs, demonstrating that it consistently delivers reliable UQ estimates with high computational efficiency.

<title>You Cannot Feed Two Birds with One Score: the Accuracy-Naturalness Tradeoff in Translation</title>

Abstract: The goal of translation, be it by human or by machine, is, given some text in a source language, to produce text in a target language that simultaneously 1) preserves the meaning of the source text and 2) achieves natural expression in the target language. However, researchers in the machine translation community usually assess translations using a single score intended to capture semantic accuracy and the naturalness of the output simultaneously. In this paper, we build on recent advances in information theory to mathematically prove and empirically demonstrate that such single-score summaries do not and cannot give the complete picture of a system's true performance. Concretely, we prove that a tradeoff exists between accuracy and naturalness and demonstrate it by evaluating the submissions to the WMT24 shared task. Our findings help explain well-known empirical phenomena, such as the observation that optimizing translation systems for a specific accuracy metric (like BLEU) initially improves the system's naturalness, while ``overfitting'' the system to the metric can significantly degrade its naturalness. Thus, we advocate for a change in how translations are evaluated: rather than comparing systems using a single number, they should be compared on an accuracy-naturalness plane.

Abstract: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) in generating code from algorithm descriptions in recent NLP papers. The task requires two key competencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers and academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding expertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark of 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed annotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we propose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that interprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves dependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm understanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies similarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code comments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ execution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In our experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs as foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \ModelName~achieves only 39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis identifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to successful reproduction. We make available our benchmark and code at https://github.com/xyzCS/SciReplicate-Bench and project homepage at https://xyzcs.github.io/scireplicate.github.io/.

Abstract: Truly multilingual safety moderation efforts for Large Language Models (LLMs) have been hindered by a narrow focus on a small set of languages (e.g., English, Chinese) as well as a limited scope of safety definition, resulting in significant gaps in moderation capabilities. To bridge these gaps, we release POLYGUARD, a new state-of-the-art multilingual safety model for safeguarding LLM generations, and the corresponding training and evaluation datasets. POLYGUARD is trained on POLYGUARDMIX, the largest multilingual safety training corpus to date containing 1.91M samples across 17 languages (e.g., Chinese, Czech, English, Hindi). We also introduce POLYGUARDPROMPTS, a high quality multilingual benchmark with 29K samples for the evaluation of safety guardrails. Created by combining naturally occurring multilingual human-LLM interactions and human-verified machine translations of an English-only safety dataset (WildGuardMix; Han et al., 2024), our datasets contain prompt-output pairs with labels of prompt harmfulness, response harmfulness, and response refusal. Through extensive evaluations across multiple safety and toxicity benchmarks, we demonstrate that POLYGUARD outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-weight and commercial safety classifiers by 5.5%. Our contributions advance efforts toward safer multilingual LLMs for all global users.

<title>DEL: Context-Aware Dynamic Exit Layer for Efficient Self-Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a widely used approach to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without reducing generation quality. It operates by first using a compact model to draft multiple tokens efficiently, followed by parallel verification using the target LLM. This approach leads to faster inference compared to auto-regressive decoding. While there are multiple approaches to create a draft model, one promising approach is to use early-exit methods. These methods draft candidate tokens by using a subset of layers of the primary model and applying the remaining layers for verification, allowing a single model to handle both drafting and verification. While this technique reduces memory usage and computational cost, its performance relies on the choice of the exit layer for drafting and the number of tokens drafted (speculation length) in each SD round. Prior works use hyperparameter exploration to statically select these values. However, our evaluations show that these hyperparameter values are task-specific, and even within a task they are dependent on the current sequence context. We introduce DEL (Dynamic Exit Layer), a plug-and-play method that adaptively selects the exit layer and speculation length during inference. DEL dynamically tracks the token acceptance rate if the tokens are drafted at each layer of an LLM and uses that knowledge to heuristically select the optimal exit layer and speculation length. Our experiments across a broad range of models and downstream tasks show that DEL achieves overall speedups of $2.16\times$$\sim$$2.62\times$ over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and improves upon state-of-the-art SD methods, which peak at $2.43\times$, by up to $0.19\times$.

Abstract: The primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an innovative prompting technique, AnaQuest, for generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using a pre-trained large language model. In AnaQuest, the choice items are sentence-level assertions about complex concepts. The technique integrates formative and summative assessments. In the formative phase, students answer open-ended questions for target concepts in free text. For summative assessment, AnaQuest analyzes these responses to generate both correct and incorrect assertions. To evaluate the validity of the generated MCQs, Item Response Theory (IRT) was applied to compare item characteristics between MCQs generated by AnaQuest, a baseline ChatGPT prompt, and human-crafted items. An empirical study found that expert instructors rated MCQs generated by both AI models to be as valid as those created by human instructors. However, IRT-based analysis revealed that AnaQuest-generated questions - particularly those with incorrect assertions (foils) - more closely resembled human-crafted items in terms of difficulty and discrimination than those produced by ChatGPT.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons, reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak), achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in many natural language processing tasks. However, their tendency to hallucinate - generate plausible but inconsistent or factually incorrect text - can cause significant problems in certain tasks, including response generation in dialogue. To mitigate this issue, we propose two novel graph knowledge-augmented frameworks, Dialogue Response Generation via Textualised Graphs (TG-DRG) and Graph-Aware Dialogue Response Generation (GA-DRG), which combine reasoning-guided dialogue reformulation, dialogue sense knowledge selection, and graph-enhanced response generation to improve the factuality of dialogue responses. To evaluate the factuality of generated responses, we propose a dialogue fact score that addresses the limitations of existing fact-score methods in dialogue settings, providing a more reliable assessment of factual consistency. We evaluate our methods using different baselines on the OpendialKG and HybriDialogue datasets. Our methods noticeably improve factuality compared to other graph knowledge-augmentation baselines, including the state-of-the-art G-retriever, achieving improvements of 3.47% on OpendialKG and 3.12% on HybriDialogue in terms of dialogue fact score. The code will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC. Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions. Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust understanding of human gestures.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly, these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

Abstract: Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.

Abstract: Humans recognize objects after observing only a few examples, a remarkable capability enabled by their inherent language understanding of the real-world environment. Developing verbalized and interpretable representation can significantly improve model generalization in low-data settings. In this work, we propose Verbalized Representation Learning (VRL), a novel approach for automatically extracting human-interpretable features for object recognition using few-shot data. Our method uniquely captures inter-class differences and intra-class commonalities in the form of natural language by employing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify key discriminative features between different classes and shared characteristics within the same class. These verbalized features are then mapped to numeric vectors through the VLM. The resulting feature vectors can be further utilized to train and infer with downstream classifiers. Experimental results show that, at the same model scale, VRL achieves a 24% absolute improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods while using 95% less data and a smaller mode. Furthermore, compared to human-labeled attributes, the features learned by VRL exhibit a 20% absolute gain when used for downstream classification tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/joeyy5588/VRL/tree/main.

This paper presents a systematic survey of the application of RL in code optimization and generation, highlighting its role in enhancing compiler optimization, resource allocation, and the development of frameworks and tools. Subsequent sections first delve into the intricate processes of compiler optimization, where RL algorithms are leveraged to improve efficiency and resource utilization. The discussion then progresses to the function of RL in resource allocation, emphasizing register allocation and system optimization. We also explore the burgeoning role of frameworks and tools in code generation, examining how RL can be integrated to bolster their capabilities. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in harnessing the power of RL to advance code generation and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Despite significant progress on popular multimodal benchmarks, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to struggle with basic visual reasoning tasks that are trivially solved by humans, such as recognizing spatial relationships. To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce VisFactor, a benchmark that digitizes 20 vision-centric subtests from a well-established cognitive psychology assessment. These subtests span four core domains of human visual cognition: (1) Visualization and Spatial Processing, (2) Perceptual and Closure, (3) Memory, and (4) Reasoning. We evaluate 20 frontier MLLMs from GPT, Gemini, Claude, LLaMA, Qwen, and SEED families. The best-performing model achieves a score of only 25.19 out of 100, with consistent failures on tasks such as mental rotation, spatial relation inference, and figure-ground discrimination, regardless of model size or prompting strategy. These findings suggest that current MLLM performance gains on high-level benchmarks do not reflect human-like low-level visual cognition, challenging the assumption that large-scale pretraining naturally induces gestalt-like perceptual capabilities. The dataset and evaluation toolkit are publicly available at: https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/VisFactor.

Abstract: AI-augmented data processing systems (DPSs) integrate large language models (LLMs) into query pipelines, allowing powerful semantic operations on structured and unstructured data. However, the reliability (a.k.a. trust) of these systems is fundamentally challenged by the potential for LLMs to produce errors, limiting their adoption in critical domains. To help address this reliability bottleneck, we introduce semantic integrity constraints (SICs) -- a declarative abstraction for specifying and enforcing correctness conditions over LLM outputs in semantic queries. SICs generalize traditional database integrity constraints to semantic settings, supporting common types of constraints, such as grounding, soundness, and exclusion, with both reactive and proactive enforcement strategies.
  We argue that SICs provide a foundation for building reliable and auditable AI-augmented data systems. Specifically, we present a system design for integrating SICs into query planning and runtime execution and discuss its realization in AI-augmented DPSs. To guide and evaluate our vision, we outline several design goals -- covering criteria around expressiveness, runtime semantics, integration, performance, and enterprise-scale applicability -- and discuss how our framework addresses each, along with open research challenges.

Abstract: Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), or providing context on the expected model of operation, is an effective way to steer the outputs of such models to satisfy human desiderata after they have been trained. But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, "can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in software vulnerability detection, yet their reasoning capabilities remain unreliable. We propose R2Vul, a method that combines reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) and structured reasoning distillation to teach small code LLMs to detect vulnerabilities while generating security-aware explanations. Unlike prior chain-of-thought and instruction tuning approaches, R2Vul rewards well-founded over deceptively plausible vulnerability explanations through RLAIF, which results in more precise detection and high-quality reasoning generation. To support RLAIF, we construct the first multilingual preference dataset for vulnerability detection, comprising 18,000 high-quality samples in C\#, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C. We evaluate R2Vul across five programming languages and against four static analysis tools, eight state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines, and various fine-tuning approaches. Our results demonstrate that a 1.5B R2Vul model exceeds the performance of its 32B teacher model and leading commercial LLMs such as Claude-4-Opus. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight calibration step that reduces false positive rates under varying imbalanced data distributions. Finally, through qualitative analysis, we show that both LLM and human evaluators consistently rank R2Vul model's reasoning higher than other reasoning-based baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in reasoning and question answering, yet their tendency to generate factually incorrect content remains a critical challenge. This study evaluates proprietary and open-source LLMs on generating relevant research papers with accurate arXiv links. Our evaluation reveals critical academic risks: LLMs frequently generate incorrect arXiv links or references to non-existent papers, fundamentally undermining their ability to properly attribute research contributions to the actual authors. We introduce arXivBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLM performance across eight major subject categories on arXiv and five subfields within computer science, one of the most popular categories among them. Our findings show concerning accuracy variations across subjects, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibiting a substantial advantage in generating both relevant and accurate responses. Notably, most LLMs perform significantly better in Artificial Intelligence than other subfields. This benchmark provides a standardized tool for evaluating LLM reliability in scientific contexts, promoting more dependable academic use in research environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/liningresearch/arXivBench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/arXivBenchLLM/arXivBench.

<title>JEPA4Rec: Learning Effective Language Representations for Sequential Recommendation via Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>

Abstract: Language representation learning has emerged as a promising approach for sequential recommendation, thanks to its ability to learn generalizable representations. However, despite its advantages, this approach still struggles with data sparsity and a limited understanding of common-sense user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{JEPA4Rec}$, a framework that combines $\textbf{J}$oint $\textbf{E}$mbedding $\textbf{P}$redictive $\textbf{A}$rchitecture with language modeling of item textual descriptions. JEPA4Rec captures semantically rich and transferable representations, improving recommendation performance and reducing reliance on large-scale pre-training data. Specifically, JEPA4Rec represents items as text sentences by flattening descriptive information such as $\textit{title, category}$, and other attributes. To encode these sentences, we employ a bidirectional Transformer encoder with modified embedding layers tailored for capturing item information in recommendation datasets. We apply masking to text sentences and use them to predict the representations of the unmasked sentences, helping the model learn generalizable item embeddings. To further improve recommendation performance and language understanding, we employ a two-stage training strategy incorporating self-supervised learning losses. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that JEPA4Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in cross-domain, cross-platform, and low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in explainable recommendation have greatly bolstered user experience by elucidating the decision-making rationale. However, the existing methods actually fail to provide effective feedback signals for potentially better or worse generated explanations due to their reliance on traditional supervised learning paradigms in sparse interaction data. To address these issues, we propose a novel human-like feedback-driven optimization framework. This framework employs a dynamic interactive optimization mechanism for achieving human-centered explainable requirements without incurring high labor costs. Specifically, we propose to utilize large language models (LLMs) as human simulators to predict human-like feedback for guiding the learning process. To enable the LLMs to deeply understand the task essence and meet user's diverse personalized requirements, we introduce a human-induced customized reward scoring method, which helps stimulate the language understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, considering the potential conflicts between different perspectives of explanation quality, we introduce a principled Pareto optimization that transforms the multi-perspective quality enhancement task into a multi-objective optimization problem for improving explanation performance. At last, to achieve efficient model training, we design an off-policy optimization pipeline. By incorporating a replay buffer and addressing the data distribution biases, we can effectively improve data utilization and enhance model generality. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Abstract: We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered multi-agent systems solving complex tasks necessitating cooperation among experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline: identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

<title>Learning to Diagnose Privately: DP-Powered LLMs for Radiology Report Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

<title>Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization for Adaptive Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive chain-of-thought generation, yet they suffer from a critical inefficiency: applying uniformly extensive reasoning regardless of problem complexity. We present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning depths without sacrificing capability. Unlike existing approaches that impose rigid constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO partitions the exploration space into budget-constrained hierarchies (512-2560 tokens), each with differentiated reward structures that preserve both efficiency incentives and reasoning capabilities. This design addresses a fundamental challenge in efficient reasoning training: traditional length penalties systematically bias models away from necessary long reasoning paths, causing exploration space collapse. Through hierarchical sampling and budget-aware rewards, HBPO maintains exploration diversity while teaching models to recognize when extended deliberation is warranted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across four reasoning benchmarks. Most notably, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration diversity.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Summary: 
- Medical text embedding models play a crucial role in various healthcare applications such as clinical decision support and biomedical information retrieval.
- Existing models are limited by training on a narrow range of medical data and outdated methodologies, hindering their ability to capture the breadth of medical terminology.
- The proposed MEDTE model, trained on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning, aims to address these limitations and deliver robust medical text embeddings.
- A benchmark suite of 51 tasks, tailored to medical text nuances, is introduced to evaluate the model's performance across classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval tasks.
- Results show that the combined approach of MEDTE and the benchmark suite outperforms existing state-of-the-art alternatives in various medical text tasks.<br />
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

<title>How Deep Is Representational Bias in LLMs? The Cases of Caste and Religion</title>

<div> Keywords: language models, representational bias, diversity, India, caste<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study focuses on representational bias in large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4 Turbo, by examining their outputs in relation to religion and caste diversity in India. By prompting the model to generate stories about significant life events, the researchers found that the responses consistently overrepresented culturally dominant groups, despite attempts to encourage diversity through prompts. The study also highlighted the "stickiness" of representational bias in LLMs, indicating a more pronounced bias than that present in the model's training data. Additionally, the findings suggested that repeated nudges towards diversity had limited success in correcting these biases. The results emphasize the need for more comprehensive approaches to addressing representational bias in LLMs, beyond merely diversifying training data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and "stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental changes in model development.

Summary:

Indian farmers often face challenges in accessing timely and language-friendly agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To bridge this gap, a novel AI-powered agricultural chatbot called Krishi Sathi has been developed. This chatbot utilizes a combination of intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned models, and retrieval-based generation to provide personalized and easy-to-understand responses to farmer queries. Krishi Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to ensure that queries are fully understood before generating a response. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi languages, with speech input and output features for users with limited digital skills. Results show that the system achieved high query response accuracy, contextual relevance, and personalization, with a quick average response time of under 6 seconds. This innovative approach showcases how AI can improve the quality and accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization, and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under 6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi interactions.

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of the Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT) as a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Traditional methods of speculative decoding and beam sampling often lead to unnecessary computational overhead due to the sequential verification of draft sequences. The HVT restructures this process by prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal candidates. The framework includes a formal verification-pruning algorithm to ensure correctness and efficiency without requiring retraining or modification of LLM architectures. Experimental evaluations have shown that the HVT outperforms existing methods, significantly reducing inference time and energy consumption while maintaining or improving output quality. This research suggests that hierarchical verification strategies could offer a new direction for accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new direction for accelerating large language model inference.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates. This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English. Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics - available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations, this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings. GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a "Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents. In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made, state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate LLM-generated reviews.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Summary: 
An entity linking agent for Question Answering (QA) tasks has been proposed, utilizing a Large Language Model to enhance accuracy. The agent actively identifies entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decisions resembling human cognitive workflows. Two experiments were conducted to verify the agent's effectiveness: tool-based entity linking and QA task evaluation. Results confirmed the robustness and efficiency of the proposed agent in handling short, ambiguous user questions in QA tasks. This approach addresses the limitations of existing Entity Linking (EL) methods designed for longer contexts, providing a solution tailored to the unique challenges of QA systems reliant on knowledge bases for accurate answers. By simulating human cognitive workflows, the agent offers a promising solution for improving the performance of QA systems, enhancing entity linking accuracy, and overall system effectiveness.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our agent.

<div> Keywords: Social intelligence, Reinforcement learning, Partial observability, Multi-dimensionality, Sotopia-RL

Summary:
Sotopia-RL introduces a novel framework to enhance the training of socially intelligent agents through reinforcement learning in complex social interactions. By refining episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards, it addresses challenges such as partial observability and multi-dimensionality. This approach allows for more accurate credit assignment to individual utterances and captures the diverse aspects of social interactions. Experimental results in the Sotopia environment show that Sotopia-RL achieves superior social goal completion scores compared to existing methods. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design in the training process. The implementation of Sotopia-RL is publicly available, providing a valuable resource for researchers in the field. <div>
arXiv:2508.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia-rl.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous agents, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), Coding, Computer automation, OSWorld benchmark <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new paradigm for autonomous agents operating computers via GUIs, incorporating coding as an enhanced action. The CoAct-1 multi-agent system combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution, dynamically delegating subtasks to either a GUI operator or a Programmer agent. This hybrid approach allows agents to bypass inefficient GUI actions for tasks like file management and data processing while leveraging visual interaction when needed. CoAct-1 achieves a state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76% on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods. The system improves efficiency by reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks. While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition, they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary. We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

Summary:
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM) is introduced as a framework to generate personalized news headlines by incorporating user preferences and factual consistency constraints into Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes a User Preference Encoder to capture user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to integrate preferences and current context into the LLM, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module to maintain factual accuracy. CAP-LLM outperforms existing methods on metrics like FactCC, personalization, and content coverage on the PENS dataset. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and sensitivity analyses confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, striking a balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news headline generation.  <div>

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1 26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations, and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news headline generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications, enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment, facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

Summary: 
Efficiency is a crucial aspect of self-consistency in long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks, but the high token expenditure can limit its practicality. This study explores the token-efficient enhancements of self-consistency through early hypothesis pruning, maintaining parallelism. The approach involves generating solutions in parallel and pruning intermediate hypotheses based on model confidence and lexical coverage. A fast weighted set cover algorithm utilizing these indicators is designed. Evaluation of five language models on math benchmarks demonstrates a token efficiency improvement of 10-35% in many cases. <div>

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880 explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

Summary: 
A new study introduces a social robot co-facilitator designed to enhance group meetings by analyzing multimodal data and providing discreet cues to human facilitators. The robot's decision-making is based on a concept bottleneck model, which focuses on transparent human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and sentiments. The study highlights a transfer learning framework that enables the model to distill expert knowledge and outperform existing foundation models in predicting intervention needs. This concept-driven system allows for real-time correction by human facilitators. Importantly, the model demonstrates robust knowledge transfer across different groups and benefits novices by improving their performance through expert cognitive model transfer. The research provides a blueprint for leveraging robotic technology to augment human capabilities in complex social settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning. Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex social domains.

arXiv:2508.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial in AI applications but updating them can be costly due to their static nature. Model editing through targeted parameter modifications presents an efficient alternative, with meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods showing advantages in effectiveness and efficiency. However, MLBME faces challenges in low-data scenarios and efficiency due to the computation of KL divergence. To address these issues, the novel Step More Edit (SMEdit) method employs Multiple Backpropagation Steps (MBPS) to enhance editing performance with limited supervision and includes a norm regularization on weight updates to boost training efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and LLMs demonstrate that SMEdit surpasses previous MLBME methods, and integrating MBPS into existing approaches further enhances their performance. The code for SMEdit will be made available soon.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation $\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance. Our code will be released soon.

<div> Keywords: Motion sensor time-series, human activity recognition, zero-shot learning, explainable AI, hierarchical agent pipeline

Summary: 
ZARA is a novel agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable human activity recognition (HAR) directly from raw motion time-series data. It automatically derives a pair-wise feature knowledge base, integrates a multi-sensor retrieval module, and utilizes a hierarchical agent pipeline to guide a large language model (LLM) in making activity predictions and providing natural-language explanations. ZARA achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 8 HAR benchmarks, surpassing existing baselines by 2.53x in macro F1 score. The necessity of each module is confirmed through ablation studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of ZARA in flexible and interpretable HAR without the need for fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. This work represents a significant step towards trustworthy and plug-and-play motion time-series analysis. The ZARA codes are publicly available on GitHub for further research and application.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR), with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

<div> Jailbreaking, large reasoning models, autonomous adversaries, multi-turn conversations, alignment regression <br />
Summary: 
Large reasoning models (LRMs) are shown to simplify and scale the process of bypassing safety mechanisms in AI models, known as jailbreaking. Four LRMs were evaluated for their ability to autonomously conduct conversations with target models and successfully execute jailbreaks in various sensitive domains. The study revealed a high attack success rate of 97.14%, highlighting the potential dangers of LRMs eroding the safety guardrails of other models. This raises the urgency for better alignment of frontier models to prevent them from being exploited as jailbreak agents. The findings emphasize the need for enhanced security measures to protect AI models from such manipulative tactics.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of 70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

<div> Keywords: Controllable Text Generation, Air-Decoding, Prefix Augmentation, Attribute Control, Long Text Generation

Summary:
- Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is important in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for generating text with desired attributes.
- Air-Decoding, a powerful prefix-based method, shows a decline in controllability with longer text sequences due to decay in attention to prefixes.
- Different types of prefixes, including soft and hard prefixes, impact the performance of controllable text generation.
- A new framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA) is proposed for enhancing attribute control in text generation tasks.
- DTPA dynamically amplifies attention to prefixes based on sequence length, selecting optimal prefix types and balancing attribute distribution reconstruction for improved text quality.
- Experiments show that DTPA outperforms existing methods in attribute control while maintaining fluency, diversity, and topic relevance in long text generation scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
Controllable Text Generation is crucial for generating text with desired attributes in NLP. Air-Decoding, a powerful method, may lose controllability with longer sequences due to attention decay to prefixes. Different prefix types affect performance. A new framework, DTPA, enhances attribute control by dynamically amplifying prefix attention and optimizing prefix types. It shows superior effectiveness in long text generation tasks, outperforming existing methods in attribute control, fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. <div>
arXiv:2508.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes. However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA) based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

<div> RAG, LLM, PAIRS, DPR, QA <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces PAIRS, a framework that combines parametric and retrieved knowledge to improve efficiency and accuracy in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. PAIRS utilizes a dual-path generation mechanism where the LLM produces direct and context-augmented answers. When these converge, external retrieval is bypassed, enhancing efficiency. In cases of divergence, a dual-path retrieval process is activated, guided by query and self-generated context signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection module for document filtering. Experimental results on six QA benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by 25% while achieving a 1.1% increase in EM and 1.0% increase in F1 accuracy over prior baselines on average. With its focus on adaptively selecting external information, PAIRS improves the overall performance of RAG systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.

<div> Framework, ToolGrad, tool-use chains, user queries, dataset

Summary:
ToolGrad is an innovative framework that transforms the conventional approach to synthesizing tool-use datasets. By prioritizing the construction of valid tool-use chains through iterative processes guided by textual gradients, ToolGrad then generates user queries, resulting in the creation of a dataset called ToolGrad-5k. This dataset features more complex tool use annotations, achieved at a lower cost and with a 100% pass rate. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those trained on expensive baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs, even excelling on out-of-domain benchmarks. ToolGrad's answer-first methodology demonstrates the potential for efficient and effective data generation in the development of tool-use datasets for language model training. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This "answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, Process Reward Models, Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model, reasoning, correction<br />
Summary: <br />
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with complex mathematical reasoning tasks due to errors in visual perception or logical deduction. Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision but lack correction abilities. The Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model (GM-PRM) transforms the PRM into an active reasoning collaborator, providing fine-grained analysis of reasoning steps and the ability to generate corrections for errors. The GM-PRM improves solution quality using a test-time inference strategy called Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN), guiding the policy model towards more promising reasoning trajectories. State-of-the-art results are achieved on multimodal math benchmarks with remarkable data efficiency using GM-PRM, which requires only a 20K-sample training dataset. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model (GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step, evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<div> Keywords: large language models, finetuning, over-memorization, learning dynamics, reasoning tasks <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study investigates the learning dynamics of large language models (LLMs) during finetuning on reasoning tasks, uncovering an over-memorization phenomenon. This phenomenon occurs when LLMs excessively memorize training data during a specific stage of finetuning, leading to high test perplexity despite good test accuracy. Factors such as training epochs and large learning rates contribute to over-memorization. Although over-memorized models maintain test accuracy, they exhibit reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and decreased generation diversity. The research shows that over-memorization is prevalent across various tasks, models, and finetuning methods, indicating unique learning dynamics in overparameterized LLMs. Recommendations are provided for checkpoint and learning rate selection during finetuning. <div>

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during finetuning.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets used in aligning large language models with human preferences. The approach is grounded in the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) implicit reward mechanism and focuses on selecting preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps. This selection method improves data efficiency and model alignment, outperforming five strong baselines across multiple datasets and alignment tasks. The strategy shows superior performance even with only 10% of the original data, offering a promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources. <div>

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work, we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only 10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

arXiv:2508.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS, can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing subjective tests.

<div> hallucinations, multimodal large language models, causal analysis, reinforcement learning, benchmark datasets  
Summary:  
Through causal analysis, the authors identify two types of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): omission-related and fabrication-related. Omission hallucinations occur when essential causal factors are not adequately captured, while fabrication hallucinations stem from non-causal cues misleading the model. To address these issues, a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness is proposed. This framework evaluates the standalone contribution and indispensability of each token to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is utilized within the GRPO optimization framework to encourage the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens. Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs.

<div> Keywords: deep research, reasoning-intensive tasks, intermediate output representation, benchmark, state-of-the-art models

Summary: 
The paper introduces the concept of deep research (DR) as a complex information task requiring broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. Unlike traditional report-writing tasks, DR focuses on the process of uncovering key claims through high fan-out over concepts during the search process. An intermediate output representation is proposed to separate the reasoning challenge from report generation, enabling objective evaluation. The LiveDRBench benchmark is introduced, consisting of 100 challenging tasks across scientific topics and public interest events. Current state-of-the-art DR systems achieve F1 scores ranging from 0.02 to 0.72, with OpenAI's model performing the best at 0.55. Analysis of reasoning traces highlights the distribution of referenced sources, branching, and backtracking events in current DR systems, suggesting areas for improvement in search mechanisms and grounding capabilities. The benchmark is available for further research and evaluation at https://github.com/microsoft/LiveDRBench. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e., broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g., datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events (e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1 score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources, branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding capabilities. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LiveDRBench.

<div> vulnerabilities, language models, alignment methods, manipulation, conversational 

Summary: Despite advancements in alignment techniques, language models can still be manipulated through strategically crafted conversational scenarios to exhibit misaligned behaviors such as deception and manipulative reasoning. A manual red-teaming approach uncovered 10 successful attack scenarios, highlighting vulnerabilities in how models handle narrative immersion and emotional pressure. The findings were used to create an automated evaluation framework, MISALIGNMENTBENCH, which revealed a 76% vulnerability rate across tested models. GPT-4.1 was the most susceptible with a 90% vulnerability rate, while Claude-4-Sonnet showed greater resistance at 40%. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing subtle, scenario-based manipulation in future AI systems to enhance alignment strategies and protect against misaligned behavior. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception, value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based manipulation in future AI systems.

<div> Keywords: sentiment analysis, cultural nuances, large language models, interpretation, social-science measurement<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the challenges of sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts, focusing on informal, code-mixed WhatsApp messages from Nairobi youth health groups. It introduces a diagnostic framework that views sentiment as a context-dependent and culturally embedded construct. The study evaluates how large language models (LLMs) interpret sentiment using human-annotated data and counterfactuals. Through rubric-based explanation evaluation, the researchers assess LLMs' interpretability, robustness, and alignment with human reasoning. By operationalizing LLMs' outputs as a measurement instrument for sentiment, the findings show varying model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs exhibiting interpretive stability. However, open models struggle with ambiguity and sentiment shifts. The research underscores the importance of culturally sensitive and reasoning-aware AI evaluation in real-world communication scenarios. <br />

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, ReasoningGuard, safeguard, malicious content, inference-time

Summary:
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown strong performance in reasoning tasks but are susceptible to malicious content generation. Existing defense mechanisms are expensive and limited in scalability. To address this, ReasoningGuard is proposed as an inference-time safeguard for LRMs. By analyzing the model's internal attention behavior, it identifies critical points in the reasoning process and prompts safety-oriented reflection at the right moments. Additionally, a scaling sampling strategy is implemented during decoding to select optimal reasoning paths while minimizing extra inference cost. ReasoningGuard successfully defends against various jailbreak attacks targeting LRMs' reasoning processes, outperforming existing safeguards and avoiding overcompensating for safety. This approach provides state-of-the-art safety defenses for LRMs without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes. Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes. Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous, safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common exaggerated safety issues.

<div> Hierarchical Text Classification, Large Language Models, API, Prompting Strategies, Zero-shot, Few-shot<br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores the use of black box Large Language Models through APIs for Hierarchical Text Classification, comparing three prompting strategies: Direct Leaf Label Prediction, Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction, and Top-down Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Results show that few-shot settings consistently improve classification accuracy. Traditional machine learning models perform well on shallow hierarchies, while LLMs, particularly the DH strategy, outperform on deeper hierarchies. However, higher input tokens for deeper hierarchies increase API costs significantly. This study emphasizes the trade-off between accuracy improvement and computational cost of prompt strategies, highlighting the potential of LLMs for HTC and the importance of strategy selection to balance performance and cost.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting. While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

Summary: 
The article introduces DP-GPT4MTS, a dual-prompt framework for time series forecasting that combines task instructions and textual context to improve accuracy. Traditional models often overlook the impact of textual information on forecasting. DP-GPT4MTS integrates multimodal data by generating clear task instructions and context-aware embeddings from time-stamped text. Through self-attention and feed-forward networks, the model refines these embeddings for enhanced performance. Experiments on diverse datasets show that DP-GPT4MTS outperforms existing algorithms in time series forecasting, emphasizing the importance of incorporating textual context for more accurate predictions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy. While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data, existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

To address this gap, the authors introduce TalkDep, a clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline that leverages advanced language models to create diverse and authentic simulated patients. By conditioning the model on diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and contextual factors, the generated patient responses aim to support diagnostic model training and evaluation. The use of validated simulated patients offers a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the accuracy and generalizability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid, natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Summary:
The article discusses the optimization technique of Key-Value (KV) cache quantization for large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes the importance of preserving original precision for the first few tokens to protect attention sinks. The study delves into the mechanisms of attention sinks and their role in extreme activation outliers across layers. The introduction of KVSink method aids in predicting sink tokens with minimal overhead, enhancing preservation during KV cache quantization. Extensive experiments show that KVSink surpasses the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, leading to more effective preservation of attention sinks. When integrated with the KVQuant method, KVSink not only improves perplexity (PPL) but also reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers. This research provides valuable insights into the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization for efficient inference in large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce \textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA (UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely unexplored.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.

Summary:
- A new annotation schema is introduced to support the generation of literature reviews.
- The paper evaluates 37 large language models (LLMs) on classifying rhetorical roles using the Sci-Sentence benchmark.
- LLMs perform well when fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving over 96% F1 score.
- Both proprietary models like GPT-4o and lightweight open-source alternatives show excellent performance.
- Enriching training data with semi-synthetic examples generated by LLMs improves performance, enabling small encoders to achieve robust results and enhancing open decoder models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations, extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240 sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First, the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1. Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results, some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder models.

Summary:
Dynamic Entropy Weighting addresses the limitation of coarse-grained credit assignment in RL algorithms like GRPO for LLM reasoning. By assigning entropy-weighted rewards to tokens, fine-grained credit assignment is achieved through GTPO. Additionally, GRPO-S assigns entropy-weighted rewards to sequences based on average token entropy. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in surpassing the DAPO baseline, showcasing the importance of the entropy-weighting mechanism in enhancing deep reasoning capabilities of models. This approach offers a promising direction for improving performance in long-chain reasoning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach for multimodal language models. This framework prompts models to generate targeted questions about their environment, guiding them to activate relevant sensory modalities. By doing so, the models can gather essential information for accurate reasoning and response generation. The framework is evaluated on a new multimodal benchmark dataset, combining various existing datasets. Experimental results show that the CoQ method enhances a model's ability to identify and integrate relevant sensory information, leading to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment with diverse multimodal tasks. The framework represents a significant advancement in enabling large language models to effectively reason in complex real-world environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

Summary: <br /><br />This study evaluates the use of advanced natural language processing techniques to improve crash data quality by analyzing crash narratives in Kentucky. Three model classes were compared, including zero-shot large language models, fine-tuned transformers, and traditional logistic regression, with fine-tuned transformers performing best. RoBERTa achieved the highest F1-score and accuracy, outperforming other models. While large language models excelled in recall, they were computationally costly compared to fine-tuned models. Mid-sized LLMs showed promise in balancing performance and runtime. Practical deployment considerations include privacy-preserving local deployment, ensemble approaches, and incremental processing for scalability. Overall, fine-tuned transformer models offer a balanced approach to improving crash-data quality with advanced NLP techniques. <div>
arXiv:2508.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs) (LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on 1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139 minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training. Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment, ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality with advanced NLP.

Summary: 
This paper explores the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the challenge of "creation without understanding" in AI development. It highlights how DNNs rely on nonlinear, stochastic processes, leading to macro-level capabilities that cannot be analytically derived from micro-level activities. The analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions demonstrates that emergent abilities stem from highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than just parameter scaling. The paper argues that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognizing DNNs as complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence seen in other natural phenomena. By shifting the focus from phenomenological definitions to internal dynamic transformations, it emphasizes the cooperative interactions among simple components in DNNs that result in transcendent capabilities. <div>

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual components.

<div> Keywords: spoken dialogue systems, automatic speech recognition, selective listening, transcriptions, evaluation method

Summary:<br /><br />
This study explores the concept of selective listening in humans and its relevance to automatic speech recognition (ASR) in spoken dialogue systems (SDSs). Selective listening refers to the ability to focus on and extract important information during a conversation. The researchers conducted experiments to compare human transcriptions of dialogue responses with reference transcriptions, confirming the existence of selective listening in dialogue generation. The results suggest the potential for a new ASR evaluation method that incorporates human selective listening skills. This approach could help identify discrepancies in transcription accuracy between ASR systems and human listeners, highlighting areas for improvement in SDSs. By understanding how humans selectively listen and process information, researchers can enhance the performance of ASR technology in dialogue systems to facilitate more accurate and meaningful interactions. <div>

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize information in user speech related to response generation appropriately. Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them. In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

<div> prediction confidence model, user-perceived latency, dialogue systems, prefetching, language models

Summary: 
The study focuses on reducing user-perceived latency (UPL) in spoken dialogue systems by prefetching dialogue responses. A prediction confidence model (PCM) is proposed to determine the possibility of prefetching by estimating semantic similarity between predicted and actual user utterances. The PCM evaluates differences between predicted and actual user utterances to improve prefetching accuracy. The goal is to predict complete user utterances before the end of the user's speech to minimize UPL. By utilizing language models and semantic similarity estimation, the PCM aims to enhance the efficiency of dialogue response preparation. The study evaluates the PCM's performance based on its ability to accurately predict user utterances and reduce UPL in spoken dialogue interactions. Overall, the PCM offers a framework for improving prefetching capabilities in dialogue systems, ultimately enhancing user experience through reduced waiting times.

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL, it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

<div> Keywords: Customer Support Conversation, COPC guidelines, CSConv dataset, LLMs, Role-playing approach

Summary: 
The article introduces the Customer Support Conversation (CSC) task, focusing on training customer service agents to utilize well-defined support strategies. A structured CSC framework based on COPC guidelines guides high-quality interactions through five conversational stages and twelve strategies. The CSConv dataset, consisting of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten with deliberate strategy use, is created and annotated. A role-playing approach using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework results in the RoleCS training dataset. Fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS demonstrates significant improvements in generating high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv, leading to enhanced problem resolution according to human evaluations. The code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

<title>StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04440</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1 Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and similar regions.

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune several representation models on this dataset. We call these models Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

<title>StyliTruth : Unlocking Stylized yet Truthful LLM Generation via Disentangled Steering</title>

arXiv:2508.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse. We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style adherence with truthfulness.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide. While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives, enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental healthcare.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team structure influences creative outcomes.

<title>Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based Dictionary Learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational databases using natural language, with applications in education and business intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models - T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across 1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2 (20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for future research.

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development, and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV), identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech research.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization, improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5% against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the dspy.GRPO optimizer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

<title>GeRe: Towards Efficient Anti-Forgetting in Continual Learning of LLM via General Samples Replay</title>

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets -- DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best overall performance.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"), completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful approach for modelling molecular systems, but it remains computationally intensive on spatial and time scales of many macromolecular systems of biological interest. To explore the opportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a Molecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how LLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in training. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach, obtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein systems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the prediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1 can learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes of proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics and kinetics.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and situational awareness.

Advances in natural language processing present an opportunity to support efficient, case-specific understanding, and to improve access to justice and healthcare. Yet existing corpora lack context necessary for assessing even simple cases. We collect and release a corpus of reputable legal and medical text related to U.S. health insurance. We also introduce an outcome prediction task for health insurance appeals designed to support regulatory and patient self-help applications, and release a labeled benchmark for our task, and models trained on it.

<title>CX-Mind: A Pioneering Multimodal Large Language Model for Interleaved Reasoning in Chest X-ray via Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches, lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer" reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148 samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment, achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical utility across multiple dimensions.

<title>GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration, guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods, ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

<title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Multi-Document Summarization of Impact-Ranked Papers</title>

Abstract: The growing volume of scientific literature makes it challenging for scientists to move from a list of papers to a synthesized understanding of a topic. Because of the constant influx of new papers on a daily basis, even if a scientist identifies a promising set of papers, they still face the tedious task of individually reading through dozens of titles and abstracts to make sense of occasionally conflicting findings. To address this critical bottleneck in the research workflow, we introduce a summarization feature to BIP! Finder, a scholarly search engine that ranks literature based on distinct impact aspects like popularity and influence. Our approach enables users to generate two types of summaries from top-ranked search results: a concise summary for an instantaneous at-a-glance comprehension and a more comprehensive literature review-style summary for greater, better-organized comprehension. This ability dynamically leverages BIP! Finder's already existing impact-based ranking and filtering features to generate context-sensitive, synthesized narratives that can significantly accelerate literature discovery and comprehension.

Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via multiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users' search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents. However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end, we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data. Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that, despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative AI has made it increasingly easy to create natural-sounding deepfake speech from just a few seconds of audio. While these tools support helpful applications, they also raise serious concerns by making it possible to generate convincing fake speech in many languages. Current research has largely focused on detecting fake speech, but little attention has been given to tracing the source models used to generate it. This paper introduces the first benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing, covering both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios. We comparatively investigate DSP- and SSL-based modeling; examine how SSL representations fine-tuned on different languages impact cross-lingual generalization performance; and evaluate generalization to unseen languages and speakers. Our findings offer the first comprehensive insights into the challenges of identifying speech generation models when training and inference languages differ. The dataset, protocol and code are available at https://github.com/xuanxixi/Multilingual-Source-Tracing.

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags, enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Abstract: With the development of social media, rumors spread quickly, cause great harm to society and economy. Thereby, many effective rumor detection methods have been developed, among which the rumor propagation structure learning based methods are particularly effective compared to other methods. However, the existing methods still suffer from many issues including the difficulty to obtain large-scale labeled rumor datasets, which leads to the low generalization ability and the performance degeneration on new events since rumors are time-critical and usually appear with hot topics or newly emergent events. In order to solve the above problems, in this study, we used large-scale unlabeled topic datasets crawled from the social media platform Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structure to improve the semantic learning ability of a graph reprentation learing model on various topics. We use three typical graph self-supervised methods, InfoGraph, JOAO and GraphMAE in two commonly used training strategies, to verify the performance of general graph semi-supervised methods in rumor detection tasks. In addition, for alleviating the time and topic difference between unlabeled topic data and rumor data, we also collected a rumor dataset covering a variety of topics over a decade (10-year ago from 2022) from the Weibo rumor-refuting platform. Our experiments show that these general graph self-supervised learning methods outperform previous methods specifically designed for rumor detection tasks and achieve good performance under few-shot conditions, demonstrating the better generalization ability with the help of our massive unlabeled topic dataset.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation $\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations $\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window $\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\% lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

<title>Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination: A Training Bias Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04567</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components, revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling (LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\% of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

<title>Do Recommender Systems Really Leverage Multimodal Content? A Comprehensive Analysis on Multimodal Representations for Recommendation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04571</link>

Abstract: Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by integrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable performance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive advantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling direct assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of semantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling foundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in recommendation tasks.

<title>Position: The Current AI Conference Model is Unsustainable! Diagnosing the Crisis of Centralized AI Conference</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.
  Experimental evaluation using the Amazon Toys Reviews dataset (10,000 unique items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of 52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods, including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce systems.

<title>SEAgent: Self-Evolving Computer Use Agent with Autonomous Learning from Experience</title>

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to imitate human behavior by responding to humans in a way that pleases them, including by adhering to their values. However, humans come from diverse cultures with different values. It is critical to understand whether LLMs showcase different values to the user based on the stereotypical values of a user's known country. We prompt different LLMs with a series of advice requests based on 5 Hofstede Cultural Dimensions -- a quantifiable way of representing the values of a country. Throughout each prompt, we incorporate personas representing 36 different countries and, separately, languages predominantly tied to each country to analyze the consistency in the LLMs' cultural understanding. Through our analysis of the responses, we found that LLMs can differentiate between one side of a value and another, as well as understand that countries have differing values, but will not always uphold the values when giving advice, and fail to understand the need to answer differently based on different cultural values. Rooted in these findings, we present recommendations for training value-aligned and culturally sensitive LLMs. More importantly, the methodology and the framework developed here can help further understand and mitigate culture and language alignment issues with LLMs.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these advancements, LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications. Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts and the complexity of understanding the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their transformer architecture: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder LMs. We further illustrate each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field.

Abstract: Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.

Abstract: As AI advances in text generation, human trust in AI generated content remains constrained by biases that go beyond concerns of accuracy. This study explores how bias shapes the perception of AI versus human generated content. Through three experiments involving text rephrasing, news article summarization, and persuasive writing, we investigated how human raters respond to labeled and unlabeled content. While the raters could not differentiate the two types of texts in the blind test, they overwhelmingly favored content labeled as "Human Generated," over those labeled "AI Generated," by a preference score of over 30%. We observed the same pattern even when the labels were deliberately swapped. This human bias against AI has broader societal and cognitive implications, as it undervalues AI performance. This study highlights the limitations of human judgment in interacting with AI and offers a foundation for improving human-AI collaboration, especially in creative fields.

Abstract: As a cornerstone of modern information access, search engines have become indispensable in everyday life. With the rapid advancements in AI and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs), search engines have evolved to support more intuitive and intelligent interactions between users and systems. Conversational search, an emerging paradigm for next-generation search engines, leverages natural language dialogue to facilitate complex and precise information retrieval, thus attracting significant attention. Unlike traditional keyword-based search engines, conversational search systems enhance user experience by supporting intricate queries, maintaining context over multi-turn interactions, and providing robust information integration and processing capabilities. Key components such as query reformulation, search clarification, conversational retrieval, and response generation work in unison to enable these sophisticated interactions. In this survey, we explore the recent advancements and potential future directions in conversational search, examining the critical modules that constitute a conversational search system. We highlight the integration of LLMs in enhancing these systems and discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in this dynamic field. Additionally, we provide insights into real-world applications and robust evaluations of current conversational search systems, aiming to guide future research and development in conversational search.

Abstract: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.

Abstract: This paper presents CLaSP, a novel model for retrieving time-series signals using natural language queries that describe signal characteristics. The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.

Abstract: Verifying and attributing factual claims is essential for the safe and effective use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare. A core component of factuality evaluation is fact decomposition, the process of breaking down complex clinical statements into fine-grained atomic facts for verification. Recent work has proposed fact decomposition, which uses LLMs to rewrite source text into concise sentences conveying a single piece of information, to facilitate fine-grained fact verification. However, clinical documentation poses unique challenges for fact decomposition due to dense terminology and diverse note types and remains understudied. To address this gap and explore these challenges, we present FactEHR, an NLI dataset consisting of document fact decompositions for 2,168 clinical notes spanning four types from three hospital systems, resulting in 987,266 entailment pairs. We assess the generated facts on different axes, from entailment evaluation of LLMs to a qualitative analysis. Our evaluation, including review by the clinicians, reveals substantial variability in LLM performance for fact decomposition. For example, Gemini-1.5-Flash consistently generates relevant and accurate facts, while Llama-3 8B produces fewer and less consistent outputs. The results underscore the need for better LLM capabilities to support factual verification in clinical text.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence surpasses human capabilities in text generation, the necessity to authenticate the origins of AI-generated content has become paramount. Unbiased watermarks offer a powerful solution by embedding statistical signals into language model-generated text without distorting the quality. In this paper, we introduce MCmark, a family of unbiased, Multi-Channel-based watermarks. MCmark works by partitioning the model's vocabulary into segments and promoting token probabilities within a selected segment based on a watermark key. We demonstrate that MCmark not only preserves the original distribution of the language model but also offers significant improvements in detectability and robustness over existing unbiased watermarks. Our experiments with widely-used language models demonstrate an improvement in detectability of over 10% using MCmark, compared to existing state-of-the-art unbiased watermarks. This advancement underscores MCmark's potential in enhancing the practical application of watermarking in AI-generated texts.

Abstract: As researchers continue to optimize AI agents for more effective task execution within operating systems, they often overlook a critical security concern: the ability of these agents to detect "impostors" within their environment. Through an analysis of the agents' operational context, we identify a significant threat-attackers can disguise malicious attacks as environmental elements, injecting active disturbances into the agents' execution processes to manipulate their decision-making. We define this novel threat as the Active Environment Injection Attack (AEIA). Focusing on the interaction mechanisms of the Android OS, we conduct a risk assessment of AEIA and identify two critical security vulnerabilities: (1) Adversarial content injection in multimodal interaction interfaces, where attackers embed adversarial instructions within environmental elements to mislead agent decision-making; and (2) Reasoning gap vulnerabilities in the agent's task execution process, which increase susceptibility to AEIA attacks during reasoning. To evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities, we propose AEIA-MN, an attack scheme that exploits interaction vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems to assess the robustness of MLLM-based agents. Experimental results show that even advanced MLLMs are highly vulnerable to this attack, achieving a maximum attack success rate of 93% on the AndroidWorld benchmark by combining two vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate multiple task-specific models into a unified model that inherits the capabilities of the task-specific models, without additional training. Existing model merging methods often lack consideration of the varying contribution ratios of different task-specific models to the final merged model. In this paper, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M3), a simple yet effective method inspired by the randomized linear interpolation strategy from the Mixup data augmentation technique. M3 performs randomized linear interpolation in parameter space between two task-specific LLMs, where interpolation coefficients are sampled from a Beta distribution to explore diverse contribution ratios. This controllable randomness allows M3 to outperform standard equal-ratio merging by discovering better contribution ratio combinations. Extensive experiments show that M3 significantly (1) improves merged LLM performance across tasks, (2) enhances out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness, (3) outperforms the positive effects of the sparsification method DARE on model merging and can be further combined with DARE to achieve superior results, and (4) balances exploration efficiency and diversity in contribution ratios by tuning the Beta distribution's shape parameters. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays a crucial role in digitizing historical and multilingual documents, yet OCR errors - imperfect extraction of text, including character insertion, deletion, and substitution can significantly impact downstream tasks like question-answering (QA). In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how OCR-induced noise affects the performance of Multilingual QA Systems. To support this analysis, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, comprising 50K question-answer pairs across three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed historical documents, which include different levels and types of OCR noise. We then evaluate how different state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) perform under different error conditions, focusing on three major OCR error types. Our findings show that QA systems are highly prone to OCR-induced errors and perform poorly on noisy OCR text. By comparing model performance on clean versus noisy texts, we provide insights into the limitations of current approaches and emphasize the need for more noise-resilient QA systems in historical digitization contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models have garnered significant attention for their capabilities in multilingual natural language processing, while studies on risks associated with cross biases are limited to immediate context preferences. Cross-language disparities in reasoning-based recommendations remain largely unexplored, with a lack of even descriptive analysis. This study is the first to address this gap. We test LLM's applicability and capability in providing personalized advice across three key scenarios: university applications, travel, and relocation. We investigate multilingual bias in state-of-the-art LLMs by analyzing their responses to decision-making tasks across multiple languages. We quantify bias in model-generated scores and assess the impact of demographic factors and reasoning strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) on bias patterns. Our findings reveal that local language bias is prevalent across different tasks, with GPT-4 and Sonnet reducing bias for English-speaking countries compared to GPT-3.5 but failing to achieve robust multilingual alignment, highlighting broader implications for multilingual AI agents and applications such as education. \footnote{Code available at: https://github.com/yiyunya/assess_agentic_national_bias

Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

<title>The Impact of Item-Writing Flaws on Difficulty and Discrimination in Item Response Theory</title>

Abstract: High-quality test items are essential for educational assessments, particularly within Item Response Theory (IRT). Traditional validation methods rely on resource-intensive pilot testing to estimate item difficulty and discrimination. More recently, Item-Writing Flaw (IWF) rubrics emerged as a domain-general approach for evaluating test items based on textual features. This method offers a scalable, pre-deployment evaluation without requiring student data, but its predictive validity concerning empirical IRT parameters is underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a study involving 7,126 multiple-choice questions across various STEM subjects (physical science, mathematics, and life/earth sciences). Using an automated approach, we annotated each question with a 19-criteria IWF rubric and studied relationships to data-driven IRT parameters. Our analysis revealed statistically significant links between the number of IWFs and IRT difficulty and discrimination parameters, particularly in life/earth and physical science domains. We further observed how specific IWF criteria can impact item quality more and less severely (e.g., negative wording vs. implausible distractors) and how they might make a question more or less challenging. Overall, our findings establish automated IWF analysis as a valuable supplement to traditional validation, providing an efficient method for initial item screening, particularly for flagging low-difficulty MCQs. Our findings show the need for further research on domain-general evaluation rubrics and algorithms that understand domain-specific content for robust item validation.

Abstract: Recent LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning during generation. However, the internal mechanisms behind these reasoning processes remain unexplored. We observe reasoning LLMs consistently use vocabulary associated with human reasoning processes. We hypothesize these words correspond to specific reasoning moments within the models' internal mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. We introduce ReasonScore, an automatic metric to identify active SAE features during these reasoning moments. We perform manual and automatic interpretation of the features detected by our metric, and find those with activation patterns matching uncertainty, exploratory thinking, and reflection. Through steering experiments, we demonstrate that amplifying these features increases performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks (+2.2%) while producing longer reasoning traces (+20.5%). Using the model diffing technique, we provide evidence that these features are present only in models with reasoning capabilities. Our work provides the first step towards a mechanistic understanding of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HGPrompt, validating its effectiveness in learning an optimal ensemble for effective multi-source prompt transfer.

Abstract: Recent development in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in biomedical applications. How ever, a critical gap persists in reliably evaluating their curation ability the process by which models select and integrate relevant references while filtering out noise. To address this, we introduce the benchmark for Curation of Retrieval-Augmented LLMs in Biomedicine (CRAB), the first multilingual benchmark tailored for evaluating the biomedical curation of retrieval-augmented LLMs, available in English, French, German and Chinese. By incorporating a novel citation-based evaluation metric, CRAB quantifies the curation performance of retrieval-augmented LLMs in biomedicine. Experimental results reveal significant discrepancies in the curation performance of mainstream LLMs, underscoring the urgent need to improve it in the domain of biomedicine.

Abstract: The composition of pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) remains largely undisclosed, hindering transparency and efforts to optimize data quality, a critical driver of model performance. Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater,a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23, with advantages that scale to models as large as 7.2B parameters. Our work establishes that holistic, multi-dimensional quality integration significantly outperforms conventional single-dimension approaches, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing pre-training efficiency and model capability. To advance future research, we release scripts, data, and models at https://github.com/opendatalab/Meta-rater.

Abstract: In this study, we introduced a new benchmark consisting of a curated dataset and a defined evaluation process to assess the compositional reasoning capabilities of large language models within the chemistry domain. We designed and validated a fully automated pipeline, verified by subject matter experts, to facilitate this task. Our approach integrates OpenAI reasoning models with named entity recognition (NER) systems to extract chemical entities from recent literature, which are then augmented with external knowledge bases to form a comprehensive knowledge graph. By generating multi-hop questions across these graphs, we assess LLM performance in both context-augmented and non-context augmented settings. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in multi-hop compositional reasoning. The results reflect the importance of augmenting LLMs with document retrieval, which can have a substantial impact on improving their performance. However, even perfect retrieval accuracy with full context does not eliminate reasoning errors, underscoring the complexity of compositional reasoning. This work not only benchmarks and highlights the limitations of current LLMs but also presents a novel data generation pipeline capable of producing challenging reasoning datasets across various domains. Overall, this research advances our understanding of reasoning in computational linguistics.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a crucial task in this digital age. The NLP community has been trying various strategies to build robust fact-checking systems. However, we have not been very successful yet. One main reason behind this is that fact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through multiple pieces of evidence, often contradicting each other, to predict a claim's veracity. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy, where we relied on the entailment ability of language models to improve the fact-checking performance. Apart from that, we did a comparison of different prompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the literature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw evidence sentences (TBE-1) and overall claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) resulted in an improvement up to 8.20% and 16.39% in macro-F1 for RAW-FC dataset, and (ii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3) outperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for LIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to reproduce the results.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has shown great promise in enhancing the emotion understanding performance of large language models (LLMs). However, current fixed-length CoT methods struggle to balance reasoning depth and efficiency. Simple tasks (e.g., sentiment classification) are over-reasoned, while complex tasks (e.g., sarcasm understanding) lack depth. To fill this gap, we present Emotion-o1, an adaptive CoT framework that dynamically adjusts reasoning length based on emotion-task complexity. Emotion-o1 is trained by distilling adaptive CoT patterns from a reasoning-oriented LLM, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a four-part reward targeting accuracy, brevity, structure, and redundancy. Experimental results on four emotion tasks highlight: (1) Emotion-o1 demonstrates significant improvements over its backbone, with F1 score increases of 10%(Sentiment), 5%(Emotion), 18%(Humor), and 27%(Sarcasm). (2) In sentiment and sarcasm tasks, our 8B model demonstrates superior performance against advanced LLMs, outperforming Grok-3 by 1.1% and Claude-3.7 by 2%. (3) The framework maintains accuracy while reducing reasoning length by 83% compared to OpenAI-o1, demonstrating effective precision-efficiency optimization. Emotion-o1 effectively balances reasoning depth and efficiency for emotion understanding in LLMs.

Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models, we investigate how 25 models - from classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2) to modern large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1) - represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology across six typologically diverse languages. Using linear and nonlinear classifiers trained on hidden activations, we predict word lemmas and inflectional features layer by layer. We find that models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout. Additional experiments probe the nature of these encodings: attention and residual analyses examine where within layers information can be recovered, steering vector experiments test what information can be functionally manipulated, and intrinsic dimensionality analyses explore how the representational structure evolves across layers. Remarkably, these encoding patterns emerge across all models we test, despite differences in architecture, size, and training regime (pretrained and instruction-tuned variants). This suggests that, even with substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties are important for next token prediction and are learned early during pretraining.

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness: FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge: Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in hands-free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose replacing text with speech as the instruction input modality for GUI agents, and introduce UITron-Speech, which is the first end-to-end GUI agent capable of directly processing speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict user actions. To tackle the problem of data scarcity, we synthesize high-quality speech instruction datasets using a random-speaker text-to-speech model. Additionally, we design a mixed-modality training strategy to mitigate the inherent modality imbalance in pre-trained foundation models. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of GUI grounding prediction errors and propose a training-free two-step grounding refinement method to alleviate minor localization deviations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UITron-Speech achieves robust performance and superior adaptability, underscoring the feasibility and potential of speech-driven GUI agents for more accessible and intelligent human-computer interaction.

Abstract: As evaluation designs of large language models may shape our trajectory toward artificial general intelligence, comprehensive and forward-looking assessment is essential. Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as general-purpose learning machines, while also revealing a substantial intellectual gap between models and humans, irrespective of how well LLMs perform on static benchmarks.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing. Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem, directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability, particularly for use in scientific research.

Abstract: Building on the standard theory of process algebra with priorities, we identify a new scheduling mechanism, called "constructive reduction" which is designed to capture the essence of synchronous programming. The distinctive property of this evaluation strategy is to achieve determinacy-by-construction for multi-cast concurrent communication with shared memory. In the technical setting of CCS extended by clocks and priorities, we prove for a large class of "coherent" processes a confluence property for constructive reductions. We show that under some restrictions, called "pivotability", coherence is preserved by the operators of prefix, summation, parallel composition, restriction and hiding. Since this permits memory and sharing, we are able to cover a strictly larger class of processes compared to those in Milner's classical confluence theory for CCS without priorities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance the performance of various applications, but they are computationally intensive and energy-demanding. This makes it challenging to deploy them on devices with limited resources, such as personal computers and mobile/wearable devices, and results in substantial inference costs in resource-rich environments like cloud servers. To extend the use of LLMs, we introduce a low-rank decomposition approach to effectively compress these models, tailored to the requirements of specific applications. We observe that LLMs pretrained on general datasets contain many redundant components not needed for particular applications. Our method focuses on identifying and removing these redundant parts, retaining only the necessary elements for the target applications. Specifically, we represent the weight matrices of LLMs as a linear combination of base components. We then prune the irrelevant bases and enhance the model with new bases beneficial for specific applications. Deep compression results on the Llama 2-7b and -13B models, conducted on target applications including mathematical reasoning and code generation, show that our method significantly reduces model size while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art low-rank compression techniques.

Abstract: Recently, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements. When dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs typically divide them into multiple local images and a global image, leading to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. Specifically, we first apply the multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens at different granularities. Then we propose a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we put forward RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).

Abstract: Recent advances in parameter-efficient transfer learning have demonstrated the utility of composing LoRA adapters from libraries of pretrained modules. However, most existing approaches rely on simple retrieval heuristics or uniform averaging, which overlook the latent structure of task relationships in representation space. We propose a new framework for adapter reuse that moves beyond retrieval, formulating adapter composition as a geometry-aware sparse reconstruction problem. Specifically, we represent each task by a latent prototype vector derived from the base model's encoder and aim to approximate the target task prototype as a sparse linear combination of retrieved reference prototypes, under an $\ell_1$-regularized optimization objective. The resulting combination weights are then used to blend the corresponding LoRA adapters, yielding a composite adapter tailored to the target task. This formulation not only preserves the local geometric structure of the task representation manifold, but also promotes interpretability and efficient reuse by selecting a minimal set of relevant adapters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple domains-including medical image segmentation, medical report generation and image synthesis. Our results highlight the benefit of coupling retrieval with latent geometry-aware optimization for improved zero-shot generalization.

<title>Automatically Interpreting Millions of Features in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: While the activations of neurons in deep neural networks usually do not have a simple human-understandable interpretation, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be used to transform these activations into a higher-dimensional latent space which may be more easily interpretable. However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing. Our code is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/sae-auto-interp, and our explanations are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/auto_interp_explanations.

<title>p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

Abstract: Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of machine learning tasks. There is growing interest in training transformers on resource-constrained edge devices due to considerations such as privacy, domain adaptation, and on-device scientific machine learning. However, the significant computational and memory demands required for transformer training often exceed the capabilities of an edge device. Leveraging low-rank tensor compression, this paper presents the first on-FPGA accelerator for end-to-end transformer training. On the algorithm side, we present a bi-directional contraction flow for tensorized transformer training, significantly reducing the computational FLOPS and intra-layer memory costs compared to existing tensor operations. On the hardware side, we store all highly compressed model parameters and gradient information on chip, creating an on-chip-memory-only framework for each stage in training. This reduces off-chip communication and minimizes latency and energy costs. Additionally, we implement custom computing kernels for each training stage and employ intra-layer parallelism and pipe-lining to further enhance run-time and memory efficiency. Through experiments on transformer models within $36.7$ to $93.5$ MB using FP-32 data formats on the ATIS dataset, our tensorized FPGA accelerator could conduct single-batch end-to-end training on the AMD Alevo U50 FPGA, with a memory budget of less than $6$-MB BRAM and $22.5$-MB URAM. Compared to uncompressed training on the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, our on-FPGA training achieves a memory reduction of $30\times$ to $51\times$. Our FPGA accelerator also achieves up to $3.6\times$ less energy cost per epoch compared with tensor Transformer training on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are often trained on datasets of query-response pairs, which embed the ability to use tools or APIs directly into the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Tool-augmented LLMs need the ability to forget learned tools due to security vulnerabilities, privacy regulations, or tool deprecations. However, ``tool unlearning'' has not been investigated in unlearning literature. We introduce this novel task, which requires addressing distinct challenges compared to traditional unlearning: knowledge removal rather than forgetting individual samples, the high cost of optimizing LLMs, and the need for principled evaluation metrics. To bridge these gaps, we propose ToolDelete, the first approach for unlearning tools from tool-augmented LLMs. It implements three key properties to address the above challenges for effective tool unlearning and introduces a new membership inference attack (MIA) model for effective evaluation. Extensive experiments on multiple tool learning datasets and tool-augmented LLMs show that ToolDelete effectively unlearns randomly selected tools, while preserving the LLM's knowledge on non-deleted tools and maintaining performance on general tasks.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can naturally emerge through a simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework with rule-based rewards, where the training may directly start from the base models-a paradigm referred to as zero RL training. Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.

<title>CAIN: Hijacking LLM-Humans Conversations via Malicious System Prompts</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs' system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions (e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"), while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.

<title>IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks</title>

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified "broadcasting" sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via "receiver" attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities, an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned, code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance, all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet prior benchmarks have largely focused on assessing the acoustic robustness of ASR models, leaving evaluations of their linguistic capabilities relatively underexplored. This largely stems from the limited parameter sizes and training corpora of conventional ASR models, leaving them with insufficient world knowledge, which is crucial for accurately recognizing named entities across diverse domains. For instance, drug and treatment names in medicine or specialized technical terms in engineering. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly enhanced the visibility of advanced context modeling and general artificial intelligence capabilities. Leveraging LLMs, we envision a unified system capable of robust speech recognition across diverse real-world domains, yet existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating this objective. To address this gap, we propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to assess the linguistic competence of ASR systems using corpora that feature numerous named entities across multiple domains. It encompasses up to 40,000 data entries with more than 300,000 named entities across over 10 domains. Beyond the audio and its transcription, each sample provides the domain it belongs to and a list of named entities it contains, which are referred to as the context. Based on this, we introduce three evaluation modes to assess how effectively models can exploit such context to improve ASR accuracy. Extensive evaluation on ContextASR-Bench highlights that LALMs outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin thanks to the strong world knowledge and context modeling of LLMs, yet there remains ample room for further improvement. The dataset and evaluation code have been released.

Abstract: Memorization in generative models extends far beyond verbatim text reproduction--it manifests through non-literal patterns, semantic associations, and surprisingly, across modalities in transcript-conditioned generation tasks such as Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) and Text-to-Video (T2V) models. We reveal a new class of cross-modality memorization where models trained on these tasks leak copyrighted content through indirect, phonetic pathways invisible to traditional text-based analysis. In this work, we introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with homophonic alternatives--e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic content. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized songs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the semantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE generate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original songs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on AudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and languages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music video--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no explicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an unprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend their training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright filters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around copyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.

It leverages large language model agents and multiple-choice question answering to generate clinically meaningful questions. Two agents, one with the ground-truth report and the other with the generated report, quiz each other to assess the preservation and consistency of findings. This method provides transparent and interpretable assessment of the reports. Clinician studies show that ICARE aligns significantly better with expert judgment compared to existing metrics.

Abstract: Radiological imaging is central to diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical decision-making. Vision-language foundation models have spurred interest in automated radiology report generation (RRG), but safe deployment requires reliable clinical evaluation of generated reports. Existing metrics often rely on surface-level similarity or behave as black boxes, lacking interpretability. We introduce ICARE (Interpretable and Clinically-grounded Agent-based Report Evaluation), an interpretable evaluation framework leveraging large language model agents and dynamic multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Two agents, each with either the ground-truth or generated report, generate clinically meaningful questions and quiz each other. Agreement on answers captures preservation and consistency of findings, serving as interpretable proxies for clinical precision and recall. By linking scores to question-answer pairs, ICARE enables transparent, and interpretable assessment. Clinician studies show ICARE aligns significantly more with expert judgment than prior metrics. Perturbation analyses confirm sensitivity to clinical content and reproducibility, while model comparisons reveal interpretable error patterns.

By routing inputs to expert subnetworks based on demographics, the model captures structured variation more effectively than previous approaches. DEM-MoE demonstrates strong performance across demographic groups, particularly on datasets with high disagreement. The study explores using LLM-generated synthetic annotations to address sparse demographic coverage, finding moderate alignment with human annotations and potential for enriching training data.

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model, DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the representation of diverse perspectives.

<div> Keywords: Preventing jailbreaking, Large Language Models, Retrieval-augmented generation, Highlight & Summarize, Generation quality

Summary:
Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to the potential for malicious users to manipulate the system. Existing approaches rely on system prompt hardening or content classifiers, but these can be easily bypassed. The Highlight & Summarize (H&amp;S) design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems aims to prevent attacks by splitting the pipeline into a highlighter and summarizer, hiding the user question from the generative LLM. Evaluations show that H&amp;S responses, especially when using an LLM-based highlighter, are often superior in correctness, relevance, and response quality compared to standard RAG pipelines. This approach provides a more secure and effective method for generating natural language answers to questions while protecting the LLM from potential attacks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Preventing jailbreaking and model hijacking of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an important yet challenging task. For example, when interacting with a chatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM to generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its intended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on hardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to detect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these probabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large space of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&amp;S), a new design pattern for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by design. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline (i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant sources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This is achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which takes the user's question and extracts relevant passages ("highlights") from the retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages and summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible instantiations of H&amp;S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of correctness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an LLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&amp;S responses are judged to be better than those of a standard RAG pipeline.

<div> Keywords: syntax, Merge, linguistics, neurocognitive, comprehension

Summary: 
Syntax, specifically the computational operation of 'Merge', is a crucial component of modern language sciences. Merge combines linguistic units to form categorized structures, respecting non-associativity and abstract grouping. This operation is considered elemental and may have emerged in a single evolutionary step. From a neurocognitive perspective, different mechanisms support mental objects constructed by Merge, such as simple command constructions, adjective-noun mergers, and noun-preposition mergers. The study investigates participants' comprehension of sentences with increasing syntactic complexity, revealing three distinct structural types. These structures may develop at different stages and be subject to selective impairment, suggesting a nuanced cognitive processing of Merge-based objects. While Merge-based syntax may have rapidly emerged in evolutionary history, the processing of different merge types appears to engage distinct cognitive mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: In the modern language sciences, the core computational operation of syntax, 'Merge', is defined as an operation that combines two linguistic units (e.g., 'brown', 'cat') to form a categorized structure ('brown cat', a Noun Phrase). This can then be further combined with additional linguistic units based on this categorial information, respecting non-associativity such that abstract grouping is respected. Some linguists have embraced the view that Merge is an elementary, indivisible operation that emerged in a single evolutionary step. From a neurocognitive standpoint, different mental objects constructed by Merge may be supported by distinct mechanisms: (1) simple command constructions (e.g., "eat apples"); (2) the merging of adjectives and nouns ("red boat"); and (3) the merging of nouns with spatial prepositions ("laptop behind the sofa"). Here, we systematically investigate participants' comprehension of sentences with increasing levels of syntactic complexity. Clustering analyses revealed behavioral evidence for three distinct structural types, which we discuss as potentially emerging at different developmental stages and subject to selective impairment. While a Merge-based syntax may still have emerged suddenly in evolutionary time, responsible for the structured symbolic turn our species took, different cognitive mechanisms seem to underwrite the processing of various types of Merge-based objects.

Summary: <br />
The Coherent Multimodal Reasoning Framework (CMRF) addresses the limitations of current large language and vision-language models in complex, multi-step, cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks. It enhances reasoning capabilities by breaking down problems, generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. CMRF consists of three modules: Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU), Contextual Inference Engine (CIE), and Coherence Assessment Module (CAM), along with Adaptive Iterative Refinement strategy. Trained on a Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning (MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It surpasses baseline accuracy by 2.4 percentage points, excelling in complex reasoning scenarios. Extensive studies and evaluations validate the effectiveness of each module and iterative refinement in improving reasoning coherence and accuracy. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs) continue to struggle with complex, multi-step, cross-modal common sense reasoning tasks, often exhibiting a lack of "deliberative thinking." They tend to rely on superficial associations rather than deep, chained inference, particularly when integrating visual information with abstract concepts. To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal Reasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense reasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference mechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries, generating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework integrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking down problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for contextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating logical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative Refinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning (MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.

Summary: 
The study explores the link between sensorial language and traditional stylistic features using Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4). It shows that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features effectively capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction. The Stylometrically Lean Interpretable Models (SLIM-LLMs) are introduced to model non-linear relationships between style dimensions. Evaluation across five genres indicates that SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features perform comparably to full-scale language models while significantly reducing parameters. The research highlights the importance of sensorial language in communication and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed methodology in capturing and predicting stylistic elements in text. <div>

Abstract: Sensorial language -- the language connected to our senses including vision, sound, touch, taste, smell, and interoception, plays a fundamental role in how we communicate experiences and perceptions. We explore the relationship between sensorial language and traditional stylistic features, like those measured by LIWC, using a novel Reduced-Rank Ridge Regression (R4) approach. We demonstrate that low-dimensional latent representations of LIWC features r = 24 effectively capture stylistic information for sensorial language prediction compared to the full feature set (r = 74). We introduce Stylometrically Lean Interpretable Models (SLIM-LLMs), which model non-linear relationships between these style dimensions. Evaluated across five genres, SLIM-LLMs with low-rank LIWC features match the performance of full-scale language models while reducing parameters by up to 80%.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to attacks, specifically jailbreaks that produce harmful responses. The authors propose a novel method that uses the Contextual Co-occurrence Matrix to effectively detect adversarial and jailbreak prompts. The approach leverages the latent space characteristics of these matrices and tensors to achieve a notable F1 score of 0.83, using only 0.5% of labeled prompts. This represents a 96.6% improvement over baselines and demonstrates the strength of the learned patterns, especially in data-scarce environments. Additionally, the method is significantly faster, with speedup ranging from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to baseline models. The implementation of the proposed method has been made publicly available to support future research and reproducibility.

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats, developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to the baseline models. To support future research and reproducibility, we have made our implementation publicly available.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to reshape artistic production and alternate modes of human expression, artists whose livelihoods are most directly affected have raised urgent concerns about consent, transparency, and the future of creative labor. However, the voices of artists are often marginalized in dominant public and scholarly discourse. This study presents a twelve-year analysis, from 2013 to 2025, of English-language discourse surrounding AI-generated art. It draws from 439 curated 500-word excerpts sampled from opinion articles, news reports, blogs, legal filings, and spoken-word transcripts. Through a reproducible methodology, we identify five stable thematic clusters and uncover a misalignment between artists' perceptions and prevailing media narratives. Our findings highlight how the use of technical jargon can function as a subtle form of gatekeeping, often sidelining the very issues artists deem most urgent. Our work provides a BERTopic-based methodology and a multimodal baseline for future research, alongside a clear call for deeper, transparency-driven engagement with artist perspectives in the evolving AI-creative landscape.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD) is proposed as a defense mechanism for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to protect against extraction attacks that can leak sensitive data during generation. PAD injects calibrated Gaussian noise into token logits during inference, selectively protecting high-risk tokens and minimizing unnecessary noise using context-aware calibration. It ensures privacy through explicit per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs tracked by a Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant. PAD operates at decoding time with minimal computational overhead and without the need for retraining or corpus-level filtering. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that PAD effectively reduces private information leakage while preserving response utility, outperforming existing defense strategies. This work advances privacy protection in RAG systems and offers a scalable solution for sensitive domains. <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by conditioning outputs on external knowledge sources. However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit per-response $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs. Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy solutions in sensitive domains.

The article discusses the limitations faced by large language models (LLMs) in providing accurate and up-to-date responses due to issues like hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these limitations, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework integrates external knowledge via a retriever. However, this integration introduces security vulnerabilities where malicious content from external databases can manipulate model outputs. The proposed Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG) framework targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems by leveraging a lightweight white-box LLM to generate and optimize malicious passages at the token level. Experiment results on open-domain QA datasets show that TPARAG outperforms existing approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness, highlighting vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and providing insights to enhance their robustness.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in providing trustworthy responses for knowledge-intensive tasks, they still face critical limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. To address these issues, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework enhances LLMs with access to external knowledge via a retriever, enabling more accurate and real-time outputs about the latest events. However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG consistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end attack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in RAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.

This research explores differences in sentiments and emotions across English-Arabic comparable texts. The texts are annotated with sentiment and emotion labels using a cross-lingual method to avoid machine translation. Emotions are labeled using a bilingual emotion lexicon created by translating the English WordNet-Affect lexicon into Arabic. The study assesses the agreement of sentiments and emotions in source-target document pairs, finding that alignment is stronger when texts come from the same news agency. Results indicate that sentiment and emotion annotations align based on the source of the document. The proposed method is language-independent and can be applied to other language pairs. <div>

Abstract: Comparable texts are topic-aligned documents in multiple languages that are not direct translations. They are valuable for understanding how a topic is discussed across languages. This research studies differences in sentiments and emotions across English-Arabic comparable documents. First, texts are annotated with sentiment and emotion labels. We apply a cross-lingual method to label documents with opinion classes (subjective/objective), avoiding reliance on machine translation. To annotate with emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise), we manually translate the English WordNet-Affect (WNA) lexicon into Arabic, creating bilingual emotion lexicons used to label the comparable corpora. We then apply a statistical measure to assess the agreement of sentiments and emotions in each source-target document pair. This comparison is especially relevant when the documents originate from different sources. To our knowledge, this aspect has not been explored in prior literature. Our study includes English-Arabic document pairs from Euronews, BBC, and Al-Jazeera (JSC). Results show that sentiment and emotion annotations align when articles come from the same news agency and diverge when they come from different ones. The proposed method is language-independent and generalizable to other language pairs.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new approach to long text generation using the multi-agent Story Generator structure, utilizing large language models as key components. To address issues like theme drift and incoherent plots, a memory storage model is implemented with long-term and short-term components. A story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory is designed to introduce uncertainty and enhance story appeal. The framework calculates storyline similarity and integrates new content through a knowledge graph. A multi-agent interaction stage simulates writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revises the text based on feedback for consistency and logic. Evaluations show that this approach produces higher-quality long stories. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a sub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic that are less appealing to human readers.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers introduce a novel merging framework, RCP-Merging, to integrate domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability. The framework prioritizes reasoning capability and selectively merges essential domain-specific weights while preserving core long CoT capability model weights. Extensive experiments conducted on models in the BioMedicine and Finance domains show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning model with domain-specific ones, leading to a 9.5% and 9.2% improvement in domain task performance over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that RCP-Merging efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge into reasoning models without significantly affecting the original long CoT reasoning capability. This approach offers a resource-efficient solution for creating dual-capability models with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capability, termed Reasoning Models, demonstrate superior intricate problem-solving abilities through multi-step long CoT reasoning. To create a dual-capability model with long CoT capability and domain-specific knowledge without substantial computational and data costs, model merging emerges as a highly resource-efficient method. However, significant challenges lie in merging domain-specific LLMs with long CoT ones since nowadays merging methods suffer from reasoning capability degradation, even gibberish output and output collapse. To overcome this, we introduce RCP-Merging: Merging Long Chain-of-Thought Models with Domain-Specific Models by Considering Reasoning Capability as Prior, a novel merging framework designed to integrate domain-specific LLMs with long CoT capability, meanwhile maintaining model performance in the original domain. Treating reasoning model weights as foundational prior, our method utilizes a reasoning capability indicator to preserve core long CoT capability model weights while selectively merging essential domain-specific weights. We conducted extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-7B, Llama3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B models in BioMedicine and Finance domains. Our results show that RCP-Merging successfully merges a reasoning model with domain-specific ones, improving domain task performance by 9.5% and 9.2% over state-of-the-art methods, without significantly harming the original long CoT reasoning capability.

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of inconsistent instruction adherence by LLMs due to lazy reasoning during the thinking stage. The proposed framework involves generating instructions with complex constraints, filtering for valid prompts, and utilizing rejection sampling to curate a high-quality dataset. The model is then initialized with this dataset and undergoes a supervised fine-tuning strategy along with reinforcement learning to encourage rigorous reasoning processes encompassing preview and self-checking. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements across different model scales, with the Light-IF-32B model outperforming both open-source and closed-source models. The innovative approach presented in this study demonstrates the potential for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities and instruction adherence in various tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs have significantly enhanced their performance in solving mathematical problems, coding tasks, and general puzzles, their effectiveness in accurately adhering to instructions remains inconsistent, particularly with more complex directives. Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking. Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1 and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.

Abstract: This study investigates political discourse in the German parliament, the Bundestag, by analyzing approximately 28,000 parliamentary speeches from the last five years. Two machine learning models for topic and sentiment classification were developed and trained on a manually labeled dataset. The models showed strong classification performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 for topic classification (average across topics) and 0.89 for sentiment classification. Both models were applied to assess topic trends and sentiment distributions across political parties and over time. The analysis reveals remarkable relationships between parties and their role in parliament. In particular, a change in style can be observed for parties moving from government to opposition. While ideological positions matter, governing responsibilities also shape discourse. The analysis directly addresses key questions about the evolution of topics, sentiment dynamics, and party-specific discourse strategies in the Bundestag.

<div> gender, language, bias, Text-to-Image models, representation

Summary:
- The research explores how grammatical gender influences visual representation in Text-to-Image (T2I) models across different languages.
- A cross-linguistic benchmark dataset is introduced, analyzing words with contradicting grammatical gender and stereotypical gender associations in five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese).
- The study reveals that masculine grammatical markers increase male representation significantly in AI-generated images, while feminine markers lead to an increase in female representation.
- The impact of grammatical gender on image generation varies based on language resource availability and model architecture, with higher-resource languages exhibiting stronger effects.
- The findings suggest that language structure plays a crucial role in shaping bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal AI systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models. Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\% on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects. Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

<div> Keywords: Privacy, Data privacy, GDPR, Language models, Anonymization <br />
Summary: <br />
Privacy, a fundamental human right, is safeguarded by regulations like GDPR. Large language models require substantial data for training, often containing private information that can be extracted. Protecting sensitive data is crucial, and while complete anonymization may not be feasible, various pre-processing methods exist to mask or pseudonymize private information in text. This report discusses several approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding private information in an increasingly data-driven world. <div>

Abstract: Privacy is a fundamental human right. Data privacy is protected by different regulations, such as GDPR. However, modern large language models require a huge amount of data to learn linguistic variations, and the data often contains private information. Research has shown that it is possible to extract private information from such language models. Thus, anonymizing such private and sensitive information is of utmost importance. While complete anonymization may not be possible, a number of different pre-processing approaches exist for masking or pseudonymizing private information in textual data. This report focuses on a few of such approaches for domain-agnostic NLP tasks.

<div> probes, syntactic structures, language models, linguistic properties, predictability<br />
Summary:<br />
- Structural probes in large language models are influenced by the proximity of words in a sentence, leading to bias.<br />
- These probes struggle to capture deep syntactic structures and are affected by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms.<br />
- The performance of structural probes does not seem to be impacted by the predictability of individual words.<br />
- The study highlights the current challenges faced by structural probes and emphasizes the need for controlled stimuli benchmarks for evaluation. <div>
arXiv:2508.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The syntactic structures of sentences can be readily read-out from the activations of large language models (LLMs). However, the ``structural probes'' that have been developed to reveal this phenomenon are typically evaluated on an indiscriminate set of sentences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether structural and/or statistical factors systematically affect these syntactic representations. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold. First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall, this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes. Providing a benchmark made of controlled stimuli to better evaluate their performance.

<div> Keywords: cultural patterns, large language models, mental health, cultural cues, symptom hierarchy

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health research, but a study found that they struggle to replicate cultural patterns in reporting symptoms of depression between Western and Eastern individuals. When prompted in English, LLMs did not reproduce the cultural distinctions seen in prior clinical psychology research. However, when prompted in major Eastern languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi, the alignment improved in some configurations. The study identified two main reasons for this failure: the models' insensitivity to cultural personas and a rigid, culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. This suggests that while prompt language is important, current general-purpose LLMs lack the necessary culture-aware capabilities for safe and effective mental health applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with depression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals report somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are increasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by prompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely fail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in major Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment in several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong, culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These findings reveal that while prompt language is important, current general-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for safe and effective mental health applications.

<div> Keywords: political discourse, language model, pre-training, debate analysis, argumentation<br />
Summary:<br />
- The article presents a new pre-trained Language Model called RooseBERT specifically designed for analyzing political discourse. 
- RooseBERT has been trained on a large corpus of political debates and speeches in English to address the challenges posed by the specific language and argumentative form of political discussions.
- The model was fine-tuned on four downstream tasks related to political debate analysis, namely named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and classification.
- Results show significant improvements over general-purpose Language Models in these tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain-specific pre-training for political debate analysis.
- The researchers have released the RooseBERT language model for the research community to further advance political discourse analysis research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing amount of political debates and politics-related discussions calls for the definition of novel computational methods to automatically analyse such content with the final goal of lightening up political deliberation to citizens. However, the specificity of the political language and the argumentative form of these debates (employing hidden communication strategies and leveraging implicit arguments) make this task very challenging, even for current general-purpose pre-trained Language Models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pre-trained Language Model for political discourse language called RooseBERT. Pre-training a language model on a specialised domain presents different technical and linguistic challenges, requiring extensive computational resources and large-scale data. RooseBERT has been trained on large political debate and speech corpora (8K debates, each composed of several sub-debates on different topics) in English. To evaluate its performances, we fine-tuned it on four downstream tasks related to political debate analysis, i.e., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, argument component detection and classification, and argument relation prediction and classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over general-purpose Language Models on these four tasks, highlighting how domain-specific pre-training enhances performance in political debate analysis. We release the RooseBERT language model for the research community.

<div> trade-off, Continual Named Entity Recognition, Knowledge Distillation, stability, plasticity

Summary:
The article introduces a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method for Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER). This method balances stability and plasticity by incorporating a pooling operation for representation plasticity and dynamically merging weights to strengthen old knowledge while acquiring new knowledge. A weight-guided selective mechanism prioritizes significant weights during fusion. Additionally, a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach handles the semantic shift of non-entity types. Experimental results across ten CNER settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the SPT method outperforms previous CNER approaches, showcasing its ability to achieve a suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is an evolving field that focuses on sequentially updating an existing model to incorporate new entity types. Previous CNER methods primarily utilize Knowledge Distillation (KD) to preserve prior knowledge and overcome catastrophic forgetting, strictly ensuring that the representations of old and new models remain consistent. Consequently, they often impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old knowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To address this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method for CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight perspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling operation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by consolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we dynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old knowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a weight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover, we develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current non-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the semantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has largely been ignored by previous methods. Extensive experiments across ten CNER settings on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPT method surpasses previous CNER approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving a suitable stability-plasticity trade-off.

This study evaluates LLMs' ability to predict individual economic decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want pricing experiments with 522 real human personas. Three multimodal LLMs were compared, revealing challenges in precise individual-level predictions but reasonable group-level tendencies. Additionally, common prompting techniques did not significantly improve prediction performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest in their capacity to simulate human-like behaviors, yet most studies rely on fictional personas rather than actual human data. We address this limitation by evaluating LLMs' ability to predict individual economic decision-making using Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing experiments with real 522 human personas. Our study systematically compares three state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs using detailed persona information from 522 Korean participants in cultural consumption scenarios. We investigate whether LLMs can accurately replicate individual human choices and how persona injection methods affect prediction performance. Results reveal that while LLMs struggle with precise individual-level predictions, they demonstrate reasonable group-level behavioral tendencies. Also, we found that commonly adopted prompting techniques are not much better than naive prompting methods; reconstruction of personal narrative nor retrieval augmented generation have no significant gain against simple prompting method. We believe that these findings can provide the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities on simulating economic behavior using real human data, offering empirical guidance for persona-based simulation in computational social science.

Abstract: Spaced repetition systems are fundamental to efficient learning and memory retention, but existing algorithms often struggle with semantic interference and personalized adaptation. We present LECTOR (\textbf{L}LM-\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{C}oncept-based \textbf{T}est-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}epetition), a novel adaptive scheduling algorithm specifically designed for test-oriented learning scenarios, particularly language examinations where success rate is paramount. LECTOR leverages large language models for semantic analysis while incorporating personalized learning profiles, addressing the critical challenge of semantic confusion in vocabulary learning by utilizing LLM-powered semantic similarity assessment and integrating it with established spaced repetition principles. Our comprehensive evaluation against six baseline algorithms (SSP-MMC, SM2, HLR, FSRS, ANKI, THRESHOLD) across 100 simulated learners over 100 days demonstrates significant improvements: LECTOR achieves a 90.2\% success rate compared to 88.4\% for the best baseline (SSP-MMC), representing a 2.0\% relative improvement. The algorithm shows particular strength in handling semantically similar concepts, reducing confusion-induced errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Our results establish LECTOR as a promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems and adaptive learning platforms.

Summary: 
This paper investigates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) exhibit linguistic convergence, a key component of human language communication. The study examines model completions of existing dialogues and compares them to the original human responses across different models, dialogue corpora, and stylometric features. The results show that models tend to strongly converge to the conversation's style, often surpassing the human baseline significantly. Convergence patterns vary across different features, but consistently show shifts in convergence behaviors among different modeling settings. Interestingly, instruction-tuned and larger models exhibit less convergence compared to pretrained models. The study suggests that the underlying mechanisms driving model convergence may differ from those in human language communication. <div>
arXiv:2508.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are generally considered proficient in generating language, how similar their language usage is to that of humans remains understudied. In this paper, we test whether models exhibit linguistic convergence, a core pragmatic element of human language communication, asking: do models adapt, or converge, to the linguistic patterns of their user? To answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific, we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are very different.

arXiv:2508.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used across different applications, concerns about their potential to amplify gender biases in various tasks are rising. Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.

Summary:
Professors often struggle to accurately estimate the difficulty of exam questions, particularly in the fields of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. This study compared the abilities of professors and Large Language Model-based methods, including Gemini 2.5, in predicting student performance on True/False exam questions. The results revealed that professors had limited success in distinguishing between easy and difficult questions, with the LLMs and Gemini 2.5 outperforming them. Interestingly, utilizing uncertainties of the LLMs in a supervised learning setting with minimal training samples significantly improved the accuracy of difficulty estimation. This suggests that incorporating LLM uncertainty in a supervised learning framework can assist professors in developing better exams and enhancing the overall quality of assessment in academia.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of exam questions is essential for developing good exams, but professors are not always good at this task. We compare various Large Language Model-based methods with three professors in their ability to estimate what percentage of students will give correct answers on True/False exam questions in the areas of Neural Networks and Machine Learning. Our results show that the professors have limited ability to distinguish between easy and difficult questions and that they are outperformed by directly asking Gemini 2.5 to solve this task. Yet, we obtained even better results using uncertainties of the LLMs solving the questions in a supervised learning setting, using only 42 training samples. We conclude that supervised learning using LLM uncertainty can help professors better estimate the difficulty of exam questions, improving the quality of assessment.

<div> Keywords: social platforms, moderation systems, multimodal framework, interpretability, hierarchical taxonomy <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Hi-Guard, a new multimodal moderation framework designed to address the shortcomings of current moderation systems on social platforms. Hi-Guard implements a hierarchical moderation pipeline, utilizing a lightweight binary model for initial filtering and a stronger model for fine-grained risk classification. It also incorporates a hierarchical taxonomy for path-based classification and directly integrates rule definitions into the model prompt to ensure alignment with moderation policies. The system employs a multi-level soft-margin reward and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve structured prediction and reasoning, penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications. Through extensive experiments and real-world deployment, Hi-Guard demonstrates superior classification accuracy, generalization, and interpretability, offering a transparent and trustworthy solution for content safety on social platforms. The code for the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social platforms have revolutionized information sharing, but also accelerated the dissemination of harmful and policy-violating content. To ensure safety and compliance at scale, moderation systems must go beyond efficiency and offer accuracy and interpretability. However, current approaches largely rely on noisy, label-driven learning, lacking alignment with moderation rules and producing opaque decisions that hinder human review. Therefore, we propose Hierarchical Guard (Hi-Guard), a multimodal moderation framework that introduces a new policy-aligned decision paradigm. The term "Hierarchical" reflects two key aspects of our system design: (1) a hierarchical moderation pipeline, where a lightweight binary model first filters safe content and a stronger model handles fine-grained risk classification; and (2) a hierarchical taxonomy in the second stage, where the model performs path-based classification over a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from coarse to fine-grained levels. To ensure alignment with evolving moderation policies, Hi-Guard directly incorporates rule definitions into the model prompt. To further enhance structured prediction and reasoning, we introduce a multi-level soft-margin reward and optimize with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), penalizing semantically adjacent misclassifications and improving explanation quality. Extensive experiments and real-world deployment demonstrate that Hi-Guard achieves superior classification accuracy, generalization, and interpretability, paving the way toward scalable, transparent, and trustworthy content safety systems. Code is available at: https://github.com/lianqi1008/Hi-Guard.

<div> Keywords: Test-time scaling, large language models, collective-agent methods, multi-agent collaboration, reward models<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS) as a new approach to enhancing large language models (LLMs) without additional training. By exploring three primary paradigms, the optimal paradigm of CTTS was investigated, with multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR) found to consistently achieve the best performance. A novel framework named CTTS-MM was proposed, leveraging both multi-agent collaboration through Agent Collaboration Search (ACS) and multi-reward-model collaboration through Mixture of Reword Models (MoR). Experiments across seven benchmarks showed that CTTS-MM outperformed existing methods. The code for CTTS-MM is available on GitHub at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM. <div>
arXiv:2508.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra training. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and Self-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model (SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling (STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Taggus, a pipeline aimed at extracting social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. It addresses the challenge of character identification and interaction detection by proposing a method that combines POS tagging and heuristics, achieving improved results compared to existing tools. Taggus demonstrates high accuracy in character identification and co-reference resolution, with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%, and satisfactory performance in interaction detection with a score of $75.9\%. The pipeline outperforms State-of-the-Art NER tools and Large Language Models by significant margins, indicating its effectiveness in the Portuguese language. The article acknowledges limitations in sample size and scope and suggests future enhancements, particularly in detecting relationships between characters. The Taggus pipeline is made publicly available to foster advancements in NLP for Portuguese literature. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform, especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage development in this field for the Portuguese language.2

<div> Keywords: large language models, in-context learning, structured reasoning, calibration, reasoning accuracy

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a new paradigm for in-context learning in large language models called JointThinking. This approach leverages both Thinking and Nothinking modes of reasoning to improve accuracy by generating two answers in parallel and triggering a second round of thinking only when the initial responses are inconsistent. JointThinking outperforms existing methods such as few-shot chain-of-thought and majority voting, with improved answer robustness. It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to state-of-the-art training-based methods while excelling on out-of-distribution tasks. The calibration mechanism lowers error rates by leveraging different reasoning modes and highlights the value of structural thinking diversity. The performance gap between actual and ideal reasoning decreases as model size increases in the second round of thinking, indicating scalability. The study also discusses current limitations and proposes future research directions in in-context learning for large language models. <div>

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies, their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking), a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel: one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent, using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\% in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases, resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL research in RLLMs.

<div> Keywords: Depression, Social media, Reddit, DSM-5, Symptomatology

Summary: 
ReDSM5 introduces a new approach to analyzing depressive symptomatology in social media narratives, specifically on Reddit. The corpus comprises posts annotated at the sentence level for the nine DSM-5 depression symptoms by a licensed psychologist. This detailed annotation allows for greater clinical relevance and interpretability compared to existing computational approaches. An exploratory analysis of ReDSM5 showcases patterns in language, syntax, and emotion that characterize symptom expression in social media. The corpus combines symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, enabling the development of models that detect depression and generate human-interpretable reasoning. Baseline benchmarks for multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation are established, providing a reference point for future research on detection and interpretability. <br /><br />Summary: ReDSM5 provides a comprehensive dataset for studying depressive symptoms in social media, enhancing both detection capabilities and interpretability in computational approaches. <div>
arXiv:2508.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is a pervasive mental health condition that affects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide, yet many cases remain undiagnosed due to barriers in traditional clinical access and pervasive stigma. Social media platforms, and Reddit in particular, offer rich, user-generated narratives that can reveal early signs of depressive symptomatology. However, existing computational approaches often label entire posts simply as depressed or not depressed, without linking language to specific criteria from the DSM-5, the standard clinical framework for diagnosing depression. This limits both clinical relevance and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce ReDSM5, a novel Reddit corpus comprising 1484 long-form posts, each exhaustively annotated at the sentence level by a licensed psychologist for the nine DSM-5 depression symptoms. For each label, the annotator also provides a concise clinical rationale grounded in DSM-5 methodology. We conduct an exploratory analysis of the collection, examining lexical, syntactic, and emotional patterns that characterize symptom expression in social media narratives. Compared to prior resources, ReDSM5 uniquely combines symptom-specific supervision with expert explanations, facilitating the development of models that not only detect depression but also generate human-interpretable reasoning. We establish baseline benchmarks for both multi-label symptom classification and explanation generation, providing reference results for future research on detection and interpretability.

<div> detecting misinformation, social media platforms, dynamic environmental representations, LSTM model, temporal modeling

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a new framework called MISDER for detecting misinformation on social media platforms. The framework addresses the dynamic nature of information by learning social environmental representations for different time periods and using a temporal model to predict future representations. Three variants of MISDER are proposed: MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, each utilizing different temporal modeling techniques. Experimental results show that MISDER outperforms various baseline models on two common datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in detecting misinformation. The framework's ability to adapt to the evolving social environment sets it apart from traditional static learning paradigms and demonstrates the importance of considering temporal dynamics in misinformation detection. <div>
arXiv:2508.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation across diverse social media platforms has drawn significant attention from both academic and industrial communities due to its detrimental effects. Accordingly, automatically distinguishing misinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an increasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a static learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links, and propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels. However, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world scenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically evolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental Representations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social environmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to predict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the temporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained dynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM, MISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER, we compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the experimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

<title>LLMs Have a Heart of Stone: Demystifying the Soft Thinking Ability of Large Reasoning Models</title>

<div> Keywords: Human cognition, Large language models, Soft tokens, Reasoning paths, Sampling strategies

Summary:
Soft thinking in large language models (LLMs) aims to enhance reasoning abilities by generating abstract and fluid tokens. However, current LLMs tend to rely heavily on influential components of soft inputs during decoding, leading to a lack of exploration of diverse reasoning paths. This behavior results in a form of greedy decoding rather than true soft thinking. To address this issue, the paper proposes incorporating randomness through sampling strategies like Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Experimental results show that introducing randomness can mitigate the limitations of conventional approaches and optimize the benefits of soft thinking. Particularly, the Gumbel-Softmax trick offers the right balance of randomness and smoothness, showcasing superior performance across various reasoning benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2508.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

Summary:  
Text embeddings are crucial for various NLP tasks, and current top-performing models are fine-tuned from pre-trained language models using supervised learning. This study compares two augmentation strategies for generating positive pairs in contrastive learning of text embeddings, finding that cropping augmentation outperforms dropout-based approaches. While out-of-domain data performance is below supervised models, in-domain data shows high-quality embeddings with minimal fine-tuning. Representation quality improves in later transformer layers, with fine-tuning of only the last layers sufficient for similar quality to supervised models. Fine-tuning mainly affects the last layers, leading to improved representation quality in self-supervised training. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text embeddings, i.e. vector representations of entire texts, play an important role in many NLP applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation, sentiment analysis, clustering, or visualizing collections of texts for data exploration. Currently, top-performing embedding models are derived from pre-trained language models via extensive supervised fine-tuning using curated text pairs. This contrasts with computer vision, where self-supervised training based on data augmentations has demonstrated remarkable success. Here we systematically compare the two most well-known augmentation strategies for positive pair generation in contrastive learning of text embeddings. We assess embedding quality on MTEB and additional in-domain evaluations and show that cropping augmentation strongly outperforms the dropout-based approach. We find that on out-of-domain data, the quality of resulting embeddings is below the supervised SOTA models, but for in-domain data, self-supervised fine-tuning produces high-quality text embeddings after very short fine-tuning, sometimes only marginally below the supervised SOTA. Finally, we show that representation quality increases towards the last transformer layers, which undergo the largest change during fine-tuning; and that fine-tuning only those last layers is sufficient to reach similar embedding quality.

<div> Keywords: product sustainability reports, PDF format, carbon footprints, CarbonPDF-QA dataset, LLM-based technique

Summary: 
Product sustainability reports in PDF format contain valuable insights on environmental impacts but are challenging to analyze due to the unstructured text. The CarbonPDF-QA dataset offers question-answer pairs for 1735 documents to address this issue. GPT-4o faces difficulties in answering questions with data inconsistencies, leading to the development of CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique fine-tuned on the CarbonPDF dataset. CarbonPDF outperforms current QA systems in answering carbon footprint questions from such unstructured PDF reports. The research focuses on standardizing the analysis of sustainability reports for better understanding of product environmental impacts. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product sustainability reports provide valuable insights into the environmental impacts of a product and are often distributed in PDF format. These reports often include a combination of tables and text, which complicates their analysis. The lack of standardization and the variability in reporting formats further exacerbate the difficulty of extracting and interpreting relevant information from large volumes of documents. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of answering questions related to carbon footprints within sustainability reports available in PDF format. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on addressing the difficulties posed by the unstructured and inconsistent nature of text extracted from PDF parsing. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce CarbonPDF-QA, an open-source dataset containing question-answer pairs for 1735 product report documents, along with human-annotated answers. Our analysis shows that GPT-4o struggles to answer questions with data inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose CarbonPDF, an LLM-based technique specifically designed to answer carbon footprint questions on such datasets. We develop CarbonPDF by fine-tuning Llama 3 with our training data. Our results show that our technique outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, including question-answering (QA) systems finetuned on table and text data.

Summary: 
The article introduces UPLME, a framework for empathy regression that addresses the challenge of noisy self-reported empathy scores. UPLME includes a probabilistic language model trained using Bayesian concepts with variational model ensembling. It predicts both empathy scores and heteroscedastic uncertainty, incorporating two new loss components to improve performance. UPLME achieves state-of-the-art results in two public benchmarks with label noise, showing effectiveness in separating noisy and clean samples. Additionally, through synthetic label noise injection, UPLME demonstrates its ability to predict uncertainty and outperform a recent UQ method for regression. This research advances the field of supervised learning for empathy detection by providing a robust framework for dealing with label noise and improving regression performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised learning for empathy regression is challenged by noisy self-reported empathy scores. While many algorithms have been proposed for learning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression counterpart is relatively under-explored. We propose UPLME, an uncertainty-aware probabilistic language modelling framework to capture label noise in the regression setting of empathy detection. UPLME includes a probabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and heteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with variational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components: one penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces the similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME provides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient: $0.558\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the performance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label noise. Through synthetic label noise injection, we show that UPLME is effective in separating noisy and clean samples based on the predicted uncertainty. UPLME further outperform (Calibration error: $0.571\rightarrow0.376$) a recent variational model ensembling-based UQ method designed for regression problems.

FilBench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating LLMs specifically in Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano languages. Tasks in FilBench cover various aspects of NLP research in the Philippines, including Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. Evaluation of 27 LLMs on FilBench reveals shortcomings in reading comprehension and translation capabilities of several models. The top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves a score of 72.23%, indicating the challenging nature of the benchmark. Models trained for Southeast Asian languages also struggle on FilBench, with the best-performing SEA-LION v3 70B scoring 61.07%. This work highlights the importance of language-specific benchmarks like FilBench in advancing Filipino NLP and promoting the inclusion of Philippine languages in LLM development.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLMs on English-based tasks, little is known about their capabilities in specific languages such as Filipino. In this work, we address this gap by introducing FilBench, a Filipino-centric benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across a diverse set of tasks and capabilities in Filipino, Tagalog, and Cebuano. We carefully curate the tasks in FilBench to reflect the priorities and trends of NLP research in the Philippines such as Cultural Knowledge, Classical NLP, Reading Comprehension, and Generation. By evaluating 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on FilBench, we find that several LLMs suffer from reading comprehension and translation capabilities. Our results indicate that FilBench is challenging, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving only a score of 72.23%. Moreover, we also find that models trained specifically for Southeast Asian languages tend to underperform on FilBench, with the highest-performing model, SEA-LION v3 70B, achieving only a score of 61.07%. Our work demonstrates the value of curating language-specific LLM benchmarks to aid in driving progress on Filipino NLP and increasing the inclusion of Philippine languages in LLM development.

Summary: 
EmbedGrad introduces a novel framework for optimizing text prompt embeddings through gradient-based refinement. It addresses limitations of current approaches by decoupling training from deployment, allowing for precise embedding adjustments guided by labeled examples while maintaining semantic meaning. This process enables fine-grained calibration of prompts, leading to significant improvements in performance across various tasks such as mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal judgment. Evaluations demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capability of prompts and achieving consistent improvements across different model scales and tasks. By bridging prompt engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, EmbedGrad establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks.

arXiv:2508.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively adapting powerful pretrained foundation models to diverse tasks remains a key challenge in AI deployment. Current approaches primarily follow two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering, or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\% to 58.96\% on mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task adaptation.

LAGER is a framework designed to enhance the alignment of large language models acting as judges with human scoring preferences. It focuses on leveraging internal representations in middle-to-upper layers of the model which encode semantically and task-relevant information that aligns better with human judgments. By aggregating cross-layer score token logits and using a softmax-based distribution, LAGER is able to produce fine-grained judgment scores without the need for complex prompts or fine-tuning. Evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that LAGER outperforms baseline methods by up to 7.5% and matches or exceeds reasoning-based approaches. Furthermore, experiments on downstream applications like data selection and emotional understanding demonstrate the effectiveness of LAGER in improving alignment between large language models and human preferences. <div>

Abstract: The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of automated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as "LLMas-a-judge." However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring, via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from performance degradation when faced with domain shifts, primarily due to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose KILO (Knowledge-Instructed Learning for Continual Adaptation), a novel continual learning framework that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with instruction tuning. By leveraging retrieved domain-specific knowledge as guidance during training, KILO enhances both adaptability to new domains and retention of previously acquired knowledge. We pretrain our model on WikiText-103 and evaluate sequential adaptation across four diverse target domains: BioASQ, SciQ, TweetEval, and MIND. Our experiments demonstrate that KILO consistently outperforms strong baselines, including continual fine-tuning, ERNIE 2.0, and CPT, in terms of backward transfer, forward transfer, F1 score, retention rate, and training efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge retrieval and instruction prompting to overcome domain shift challenges in continual learning scenarios.

Summary: 
The article introduces Double-Bench, a new evaluation system designed to assess complex document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by offering a large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation platform that includes real-world data and human-verified queries. Experiments conducted using Double-Bench reveal the narrowing gap between text and visual embedding models, emphasizing the importance of strong document retrieval models. The study also uncovers an over-confidence issue in current document RAG frameworks, indicating a need for improved evidence-based decision-making. The open-source nature of Double-Bench aims to provide a solid foundation for future research on advanced document RAG systems, with plans for regular updates and new benchmarks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880 pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4 document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness. Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4 MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new benchmarks on an annual basis.

Summary:<br />
Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that poses challenges for sentiment analysis and emotion-sensitive tasks due to the disparity between literal and intended meanings. Traditional sarcasm detection methods focus on text, but incorporating multimodal information has shown promise. This paper evaluates the use of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA), specifically in Multimodal Sarcasm Detection and Explanation tasks. The study reveals limitations, such as inadequate visual understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge in LVLMs. To address these issues, a training-free framework that integrates object extraction and external conceptual knowledge is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on multiple models.

While traditional sarcasm detection methods primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

Summary: 
CTR-Sink is introduced to address the semantic fragmentation issue in Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction by leveraging Language Models for user behavior sequences. It proposes behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios, incorporating temporal distance signals between behaviors and optimizing attention aggregation. The framework includes a two-stage training strategy to guide LM attention towards sink tokens and an attention sink mechanism to enhance inter-sink dependencies for improved behavioral correlation capture. Experiments on industrial and open-source datasets validate the method's efficacy, demonstrating enhanced prediction performance across various scenarios. Visualizations support the effectiveness of CTR-Sink in optimizing attention focus and capturing meaningful behavior boundaries and relationships. <div>
arXiv:2508.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, a core task in recommendation systems, estimates user click likelihood using historical behavioral data. Modeling user behavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has gained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual modeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior sequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty separators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM pre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention scatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior boundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance. To address this, we propose $\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing behavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired by attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically regulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we insert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating recommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable attention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy that explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink mechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral correlations. Experiments on one industrial dataset and two open-source datasets (MovieLens, Kuairec), alongside visualization results, validate the method's effectiveness across scenarios.

Summary:<br />
State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown variations in performance when evaluated on general benchmarks like HumanEval compared to specialized suites like ParEval. The study introduces PartialOrderEval, which enhances code generation benchmarks by incorporating a partial order of prompts ranging from minimal to detailed. By applying this approach to HumanEval and subsets of ParEval, the researchers analyze how the specificity of prompts impacts the performance of LLMs. The experiments conducted using Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder reveal differing degrees of sensitivity to prompt details across different tasks. The analysis suggests that explicit I/O specifications, effective handling of edge cases, and providing stepwise breakdowns are crucial factors in improving prompt detail. This study sheds light on the importance of carefully crafting prompts to enhance the performance of LLMs on specialized code generation tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high pass@1 on general benchmarks like HumanEval but underperform on specialized suites such as ParEval. Is this due to LLMs missing domain knowledge or insufficient prompt detail is given? To answer this, we introduce PartialOrderEval, which augments any code generation benchmark with a partial order of prompts from minimal to maximally detailed. Applying it to HumanEval and both serial and OpenMP subsets of ParEval, we measure how pass@1 scales with prompt specificity. Our experiments with Llama-3.x and Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrate varying degrees of prompt sensitivity across different tasks, and a qualitative analysis highlights explicit I/O specifications, edge-case handling, and stepwise breakdowns as the key drivers of prompt detail improvement.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains 96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4% improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer, and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably support formative evaluation and professional development. This work demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale within academic institutions.

Abstract: Corporate credit rating serves as a crucial intermediary service in the market economy, playing a key role in maintaining economic order. Existing credit rating models rely on financial metrics and deep learning. However, they often overlook insights from non-financial data, such as corporate annual reports. To address this, this paper introduces a corporate credit rating framework that integrates financial data with features extracted from annual reports using FinBERT, aiming to fully leverage the potential value of unstructured text data. In addition, we have developed a large-scale dataset, the Comprehensive Corporate Rating Dataset (CCRD), which combines both traditional financial data and textual data from annual reports. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the rating predictions by 8-12%, significantly improving the effectiveness and reliability of corporate credit ratings.

Abstract: Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.

Abstract: Speech codecs serve as a crucial bridge in unifying speech and text language models. Existing codec methods face several challenges in semantic encoding, such as residual paralinguistic information (e.g., timbre, emotion), insufficient semantic completeness, limited reconstruction capability, and lack of support for streaming. To address these challenges, we propose SecoustiCodec, a cross-modal aligned low-bitrate streaming speech codec that disentangles semantic and paralinguistic information in a single-codebook space. To ensure semantic completeness and reconstruction fidelity, paralinguistic encoding is introduced to bridge the information gap between semantic and acoustic encoding. A semantic-only efficient quantization method based on VAE (Variational Autoencoder) and FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) is proposed. This approach alleviates the long-tail distribution problem of tokens while maintaining high codebook utilization. A semantic disentanglement method based on contrastive learning is proposed, which aligns text and speech in a joint multimodal frame-level space, effectively removing paralinguistic information from semantic encoding. An acoustic-constrained multi-stage optimization strategy is proposed to ensure robust and stable convergence. Figure~\ref{fig:pesq_kbps_below_2kbps} shows SecoustiCodec achieves SOTA (state-of-the-art) reconstruction quality (PESQ) of 1.77/2.58 at 0.27/1 kbps. The code and model weights for SecoustiCodec will be open-sourced upon the completion of the peer-review process. We've open-sourced SecoustiCodec's demo, code, and model weights.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts. VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs (e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity, and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative, visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets, with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols, manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show 60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM application development.

Abstract: AGENTiGraph is a user-friendly, agent-driven system that enables intuitive interaction and management of domain-specific data through the manipulation of knowledge graphs in natural language. It gives non-technical users a complete, visual solution to incrementally build and refine their knowledge bases, allowing multi-round dialogues and dynamic updates without specialized query languages. The flexible design of AGENTiGraph, including intent classification, task planning, and automatic knowledge integration, ensures seamless reasoning between diverse tasks. Evaluated on a 3,500-query benchmark within an educational scenario, the system outperforms strong zero-shot baselines (achieving 95.12% classification accuracy, 90.45% execution success), indicating potential scalability to compliance-critical or multi-step queries in legal and medical domains, e.g., incorporating new statutes or research on the fly. Our open-source demo offers a powerful new paradigm for multi-turn enterprise knowledge management that bridges LLMs and structured graphs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics, quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency, and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

<title>Understanding the Embedding Models on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph</title>

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information. Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue. To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

<title>Reliable Evaluation Protocol for Low-Precision Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

<title>VLMQ: Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models via Hessian Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to 39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based on open models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks. We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative, introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in https://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval. While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain, long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts, primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training, advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models, thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility for both research and production environments.

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However, most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) on Twitter regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war, distinguishing between genuine OSINT and deceptive misinformation efforts, termed "BULLSHINT." Utilizing a dataset spanning from January 2022 to July 2023, we analyze nearly 2 million tweets from approximately 1,040 users involved in discussing real-time military engagements, strategic analyses, and misinformation related to the conflict. Using sentiment analysis, partisanship detection, misinformation identification, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), we uncover communicative patterns and dissemination strategies within the OSINT community. Significant findings reveal a predominant negative sentiment influenced by war events, a nuanced distribution of pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian partisanship, and the potential strategic manipulation of information. Additionally, we apply community detection techniques, which are able to identify distinct clusters partisanship, topics, and misinformation, highlighting the complex dynamics of information spread on social media. This research contributes to the understanding of digital warfare and misinformation dynamics, offering insights into the operationalization of OSINT in geopolitical conflicts.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans, among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$ configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N \times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and $N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Abstract: Question answering(QA) is one of the most challenging yet widely investigated problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Question-answering (QA) systems try to produce answers for given questions. These answers can be generated from unstructured or structured text. Hence, QA is considered an important research area that can be used in evaluating text understanding systems. A large volume of QA studies was devoted to the English language, investigating the most advanced techniques and achieving state-of-the-art results. However, research efforts in the Arabic question-answering progress at a considerably slower pace due to the scarcity of research efforts in Arabic QA and the lack of large benchmark datasets. Recently many pre-trained language models provided high performance in many Arabic NLP problems. In this work, we evaluate the state-of-the-art pre-trained transformers models for Arabic QA using four reading comprehension datasets which are Arabic-SQuAD, ARCD, AQAD, and TyDiQA-GoldP datasets. We fine-tuned and compared the performance of the AraBERTv2-base model, AraBERTv0.2-large model, and AraELECTRA model. In the last, we provide an analysis to understand and interpret the low-performance results obtained by some models.

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods rely solely on structural information, struggling with the inherent sparsity of knowledge graphs (KGs). By contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) encapsulate extensive world knowledge and exhibit powerful context modeling capabilities, making them promising for mitigating the limitations of traditional methods. However, direct fine-tuning of LLMs for KGC, though effective, imposes substantial computational and memory overheads, while utilizing non-fine-tuned LLMs is efficient but yields suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel framework that synergizes the strengths of LLMs with robust knowledge representation to enable effective and efficient KGC. We extract the context-aware hidden states of knowledge triples from the intermediate layers of LLMs, thereby capturing rich semantic and relational nuances. These representations are then utilized to train a data-efficient classifier tailored specifically for KGC tasks. To bridge the semantic gaps between LLMs and KGs, we employ subgraph sampling on KGs to generate model-friendly entity descriptions. We further adopt sliced mutual information (SMI) as a principled metric to quantify the task-specific information encoded in these representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. We achieve a 47\% relative improvement over previous methods based on non-fine-tuned LLMs and, to our knowledge, are the first to achieve classification performance comparable to fine-tuned LLMs while enhancing GPU memory efficiency by $188\times$ and accelerating training and inference by $26.11\times$.

Abstract: Due to scarcity of time-series data annotated with descriptive texts, training a model to generate descriptive texts for time-series data is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.

<title>Think Outside the Data: Colonial Biases and Systemic Issues in Automated Moderation Pipelines for Low-Resource Languages</title>

Abstract: Most social media users come from the Global South, where harmful content usually appears in local languages. Yet, AI-driven moderation systems struggle with low-resource languages spoken in these regions. Through semi-structured interviews with 22 AI experts working on harmful content detection in four low-resource languages: Tamil (South Asia), Swahili (East Africa), Maghrebi Arabic (North Africa), and Quechua (South America)--we examine systemic issues in building automated moderation tools for these languages. Our findings reveal that beyond data scarcity, socio-political factors such as tech companies' monopoly on user data and lack of investment in moderation for low-profit Global South markets exacerbate historic inequities. Even if more data were available, the English-centric and data-intensive design of language models and preprocessing techniques overlooks the need to design for morphologically complex, linguistically diverse, and code-mixed languages. We argue these limitations are not just technical gaps caused by "data scarcity" but reflect structural inequities, rooted in colonial suppression of non-Western languages. We discuss multi-stakeholder approaches to strengthen local research capacity, democratize data access, and support language-aware solutions to improve automated moderation for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. Although these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly between languages due to the imbalanced distribution of training data. Existing approaches using sample-level translation for extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's hidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of our method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.

Abstract: LLM developers are increasingly reliant on synthetic data, but generating high-quality data for complex long-context reasoning tasks remains challenging. We introduce CLIPPER, a compression-based approach for generating synthetic data tailored to narrative claim verification - a task that requires reasoning over a book to verify a given claim. Instead of generating claims directly from the raw text of the book, which results in artifact-riddled claims, CLIPPER first compresses the book into chapter outlines and book summaries and then uses these intermediate representations to generate complex claims and corresponding chain-of-thoughts. Compared to naive approaches, CLIPPER produces claims that are more valid, grounded, and complex. Using CLIPPER, we construct a dataset of 19K synthetic book claims paired with their source texts and chain-of-thought reasoning, and use it to fine-tune three open-weight models. Our best model achieves breakthrough results on narrative claim verification (from 28% to 76% accuracy on our test set) and sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-10B models on the NoCha leaderboard. Further analysis shows that our models generate more detailed and grounded chain-of-thought reasoning while also improving performance on other narrative understanding tasks (e.g., NarrativeQA).

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial ``jailbreak'' prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates, they demand considerable human effort and time. Our multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize -- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success rates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than half on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing both native guardrails and external input-output filters. By converting multi-turn conversations into concise single-turn prompts, the M2S framework provides a scalable tool for large-scale red teaming and reveals critical weaknesses in contemporary LLM defenses.

Abstract: Automatic medical report generation has the potential to support clinical diagnosis, reduce the workload of radiologists, and demonstrate potential for enhancing diagnostic consistency. However, current evaluation metrics often fail to reflect the clinical reliability of generated reports. Early overlap-based methods focus on textual matches between predicted and ground-truth entities but miss fine-grained clinical details (e.g., anatomical location, severity). Some diagnostic metrics are limited by fixed vocabularies or templates, reducing their ability to capture diverse clinical expressions. LLM-based approaches further lack interpretable reasoning steps, making it hard to assess or trust their behavior in safety-critical settings. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs stable calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = $0.69$ for ReXVal dataset and Kendall coefficient = $0.45$ for RadEvalX dataset). The anonymous project demo is available at: https://github.com/Zhenxuan-Zhang/GEMA_score.

Abstract: In controlled text generation using large language models (LLMs), gaps arise between the language model's interpretation of concepts and people's expectations. We introduce the human evaluation task of Representation Alignment for measuring this gap. We selected four emotion representations: Words, Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensions expressed in both Lexical and Numeric forms, and Emojis and evaluate them in the context of keyword-guided sentence generation using both GPT-4 and LLaMA-3. In addition to Representation Alignment, we also measure people's judgments of the accuracy and realism of the generated sentences. While representations like VAD break emotions into easy-to-compute components, our findings show that people agree more with how LLMs generate when conditioned on English words (e.g., ``angry'') rather than VAD scales. This difference is especially visible when comparing Numeric VAD to words. Furthermore, we found that the perception of how much a generated sentence conveys an emotion is dependent on both the representation type and which emotion it is.

Abstract: Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) are foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation. However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent outputs and exhibit biases, limiting their representation of diverse language patterns. The closed-source nature of many powerful LLMs further restricts industry applications due to data privacy concerns. Inspired by successes in text generation, LLM ensemble techniques are now increasingly explored for code generation. This article reviews these emerging ensemble approaches to enhance understanding, encourage further research, and promote practical implementation in both text and code generation. We categorize LLM ensembles into seven main methods - weight merging, knowledge fusion, mixture-of-experts, reward ensemble, output ensemble, routing, and cascading - analyzing capabilities of those approaches. Our findings highlight key benefits such as improved diversity representation, enhanced output quality, and greater application flexibility. These insights aid model selection for real-world tasks and crucially, lay groundwork for extending ensemble strategies to multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving. Code and data are available in https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit/blob/main/examples/ADSEdit.md.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to attend heavily to the first token in the sequence -- creating a so-called attention sink. Many works have studied this phenomenon in detail, proposing various ways to either leverage or alleviate it. Attention sinks have been connected to quantisation difficulties, security issues, and streaming attention. Yet, while many works have provided conditions in which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why do LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? In this work, we argue theoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to avoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study mathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as context length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour. We hope that this study provides a new practical perspective on why attention sinks are useful in LLMs, leading to a better understanding of the attention patterns that form during training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.

Abstract: In recent years, accurately and quickly deploying medical large language models (LLMs) has become a trend. Among these, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has garnered attention due to rapid deployment and privacy protection. However, the challenge hinder the practical deployment of RAG for medical diagnosis: the semantic gap between colloquial patient descriptions and the professional terminology within medical knowledge bases. We try to address the challenge from the data perspective and the method perspective. First, to address the semantic gap in existing knowledge bases, we construct DiagnosGraph, a generalist knowledge graph covering both modern medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It contains 876 common diseases with the graph of 7,997 nodes and 37,201 triples. To bridge the gap between colloquial patient narratives and academic medical knowledge, DiagnosGraph also introduces $1,908$ medical record by formalizing the patient chief complaint and proposing a medical diagnosis. Second, we introduce the Multi-Round Diagnostic RAG (MRD-RAG) framework. It utilizes a multi-round dialogue to refine diagnostic possibilities, emulating the clinical reasoning of a physician. Experiments conducted on four medical benchmarks, with evaluations by human physicians, demonstrate that MRD-RAG enhances the diagnostic performance of LLMs, highlighting its potential to make automated diagnosis more accurate and human-aligned.

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Abstract: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it difficult to track progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While tools like citation networks and search engines help retrieve related papers, they lack the abstraction needed to capture the needed to represent the density and structure of activity across subfields.
  We motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature into a high-quality hierarchical structure that spans multiple levels of abstraction -- from broad domains to specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve this goal, we develop a hybrid approach that combines efficient embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting, striking a balance between scalability and semantic precision. Compared to LLM-heavy methods like iterative tree construction, our approach achieves superior quality-speed trade-offs. Our hierarchies capture different dimensions of research contributions, reflecting the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of modern science. We evaluate its utility by measuring how effectively an LLM-based agent can navigate the hierarchy to locate target papers. Results show that our method improves interpretability and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions, providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in eight languages (Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic, German, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift, ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations (qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM, enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, play a substantial role in many cutting-edge commercial applications, and continue to fascinate researchers across nearly all fields for their potential to accomplish expensive, complex tasks that, until recently, only humans have been trusted to do. These workflows depend critically on the prompts used to provide the roles models play in such workflows. Poorly designed prompts that fail even slightly to guide individual agents can lead to sub-optimal performance that may snowball within a system of agents, limiting their reliability and scalability. To address this important problem of inference-time prompt optimization, we introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time optimization method that uses an agentic loop of LLMs to generate and apply textual feedback. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to approach the performance of their larger counterparts. This highlights its potential for building more cost-effective and powerful hybrid AI systems, thereby democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of speech tokenizer designs in LLM-centric SLMs, augmented by speech heads and speaker modeling. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge understanding and speaker consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective, showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.

Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts. Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as the reward, (3) enforces reasoning-aware decoding that completes "Findings" before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings section before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing baselines on both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores.

Abstract: High-tech Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) has been rapidly advancing in recent years due to the increased use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, but many of these techniques are integrated without the inclusion of the users' perspectives. Autistic adults have been particularly neglected in the design of AAC tools. We conducted in-depth interviews with 12 autistic adults to find the pain points of current AAC and determine what technological advances they might find helpful. We found 8 different categories of themes from our interviews: input flexibility, output flexibility, selecting or adapting AAC, contexts for AAC use, benefits, access as an adult, stumbling blocks for continued use, and control of communication. In this paper, we go through these categories in depth -- comparing each to prior work -- and then highlight novel findings to suggest possible research directions.

<title>BrainECHO: Semantic Brain Signal Decoding through Vector-Quantized Spectrogram Reconstruction for Whisper-Enhanced Text Generation</title>

Abstract: Current EEG/MEG-to-text decoding systems suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on teacher-forcing methods, which compromises robustness during inference, (2) sensitivity to session-specific noise, hindering generalization across subjects, and (3) misalignment between brain signals and linguistic representations due to pre-trained language model over-dominance. To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces.

<title>Talking to DINO: Bridging Self-Supervised Vision Backbones with Language for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims at segmenting images from free-form textual concepts without predefined training classes. While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks. Source code and models are publicly available at: https://lorebianchi98.github.io/Talk2DINO/.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computational pathology have produced patch-level Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), but these models are limited by their inability to analyze whole slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and their tendency to bypass crucial morphological features that pathologists rely on for diagnosis. To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities, but they remain susceptible to hallucination, particularly object hallucination where non-existent objects or incorrect attributes are fabricated in generated descriptions. Existing detection methods achieve strong performance but rely heavily on expensive API calls and iterative LVLM-based validation, making them impractical for large-scale or offline use. To address these limitations, we propose CutPaste\&amp;Find, a lightweight and training-free framework for detecting hallucinations in LVLM-generated outputs. Our approach leverages off-the-shelf visual and linguistic modules to perform multi-step verification efficiently without requiring LVLM inference. At the core of our framework is a Visual-aid Knowledge Base that encodes rich entity-attribute relationships and associated image representations. We introduce a scaling factor to refine similarity scores, mitigating the issue of suboptimal alignment values even for ground-truth image-text pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including POPE and R-Bench, demonstrate that CutPaste\&amp;Find achieves competitive hallucination detection performance while being significantly more efficient and cost-effective than previous methods.

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of sleep-tracking devices, many individuals struggle to translate data into actionable improvements in sleep health. Current methods often provide data-driven suggestions but may not be feasible and adaptive to real-life constraints and individual contexts. We present HealthGuru, a novel large language model-powered chatbot to enhance sleep health through data-driven, theory-guided, and adaptive recommendations with conversational behavior change support. HealthGuru's multi-agent framework integrates wearable device data, contextual information, and a contextual multi-armed bandit model to suggest tailored sleep-enhancing activities. The system facilitates natural conversations while incorporating data-driven insights and theoretical behavior change techniques. Our eight-week in-the-wild deployment study with 16 participants compared HealthGuru to a baseline chatbot. Results show improved metrics like sleep duration and activity scores, higher quality responses, and increased user motivation for behavior change with HealthGuru. We also identify challenges and design considerations for personalization and user engagement in health chatbots.

Abstract: Binary relations, such as equality, are basic mathematical concepts that appear, implicitly or explicitly, in most benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLM). A recent trend in the literature is benchmarking LLMs on out-of-context learning, where the data is not presented in the prompt, but only during the model's training. However, existing works mostly focus on higher-order tasks, making it hard to interpret success or failure. In this work, we study how well can LLMs reason out-of-context on binary relations by only learning the representations of newly introduced tokens. Our experiments focus on equality ($=$), inequality ($<$), and inclusion ($\subset$) and the properties they satisfy, such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and logical complexity (e.g., the number of reasoning "hops"). We show that LLMs achieve better than random accuracy, but are still far from perfect, even on relatively simple reasoning tasks involving binary relations. We analyse the learned representations and show that LLMs encode useful information directly, arranging the embeddings according to the task.

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

Abstract: Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance. Antidistillation sampling provides exactly this capability. By strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution, antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's practical utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice (Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length. Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models, because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly -- because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Abstract: Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal Large Language Models has significantly advanced the ability to analyze and understand complex data inputs from different modalities. However, the processing of long documents remains under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities. Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this area.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools in natural language processing, but their size and complexity pose challenges for researchers. Platforms like Hugging Face host a vast number of models and datasets, but these can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components from previous models. To address this, a study examines the supply chain of LLMs by collecting information and creating a graph to model relationships between models and datasets. Analysis on this graph reveals insights into the development process and potential risks associated with LLMs. Understanding these relationships is crucial for improving model fairness, detecting risks, and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning architectures to process and predict sequences of words based on context, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. However, the increasing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying cutting-edge LLMs demand extensive computational resources and large-scale datasets. This creates a significant barrier for researchers and practitioners. Because of that, platforms that host models and datasets have gained widespread popularity. For example, on one of the most popular platforms, i.e., Hugging Face, there are more than 1.8 million models and more than 450K datasets by the end of June 2025, and the trend does not show any slowdown.
  As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pretrained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks better, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to collect LLMs' supply chain information systematically. With the collected information, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a large directed heterogeneous graph having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Then, on top of this graph, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.

<div> Keywords: document classification, graph-based models, self-attention model, data-driven graph structures, statistical filtering

Summary:
Our study introduces a novel method for document classification that utilizes graph-based models to capture document structure effectively. Unlike previous approaches, our method learns data-driven graph structures, eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. The approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes and learns edges using a self-attention model to identify dependencies between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy is employed to retain only strongly correlated sentences, enhancing graph quality and reducing size. Experimental results on three document classification datasets show that learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher accuracy and $F_1$ score. The study also highlights the effectiveness of statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These findings suggest the potential of automatic graph generation in NLP applications and pave the way for broader applications in the field.

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures, eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality \textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm. Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm. Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact center conversations.

XAutoLM is a new automated framework for efficient language model fine-tuning that leverages meta-learning to optimize model selection and hyperparameter optimization. By learning from past experiences, XAutoLM extracts meta-features to guide the search process towards successful configurations and away from dead ends. Results on various text classification and question-answering tasks show that XAutoLM outperforms zero-shot optimization methods, reduces evaluation time, decreases error rates, and identifies more effective pipelines. The framework is designed to enhance resource-efficient and environmentally friendly fine-tuning of language models in the NLP community. The release of XAutoLM and the associated experience store aims to facilitate Green AI practices and promote more sustainable machine learning processes. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact. However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new adaptive framework for question-answering systems called MAO-ARAG, which utilizes multi-agent orchestration to dynamically plan workflows for each query. The framework consists of multiple executor agents for tasks such as query reformulation, document selection, and generation. A planner agent selects and integrates these executors in a suitable workflow, guided by reinforcement learning. The framework aims to balance high-quality answers with reasonable costs by optimizing a reward based on F1 score and penalizing costs. Experimental results on various datasets show that MAO-ARAG achieves high answer quality while maintaining cost and latency within acceptable limits. The code for MAO-ARAG is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework. Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on https://github.com/chenyiqun/Agentic-RAG.

A new benchmark called UrBLiMP assesses the linguistic knowledge of Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) in Urdu by using pairs of minimally different sentences. The dataset comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting core syntactic phenomena in Urdu, ensuring reliability through human evaluation with a 96.10% inter-annotator agreement. Evaluation of twenty multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP reveals varying performance across linguistic phenomena, with models like LLaMA-3-70B and Gemma-3-27B-PT achieving high accuracy.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability. UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena, carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form, optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

This study evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultations. Models like o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2, Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were assessed for their ability to create clinically coherent and concise templates. While these models showed high comprehensiveness, they struggled with generating overly long templates and prioritizing the most important clinical questions within length constraints. Performance varied across different medical specialties, with narrative-driven fields like psychiatry and pain medicine showing significant deterioration.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using 145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2, Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3 achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of real-world physician communication.

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The \textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different languages. The goal of the task is to implement an emotion recogniser that can identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

The proposed method, Suffix Optimization (SOP), effectively appends optimized suffixes to prompts, achieving content restriction without the need for model fine-tuning.

arXiv:2508.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction} (AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named \textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches, including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark} (CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8 carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

A new task of segmenting chat queries into different elements highlights how request-making in LLM queries differs from human-human interactions. Diachronic analyses on user expressions reveal evolving query patterns, with early queries focusing on requests and users eventually converging with experience. The introduction of new models influences user behavior, leading to traceable changes at the community level. This research sheds light on the complexities of user interactions in chat-based systems and the impact of model capabilities on query patterns over time.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles, query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable at the community level.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces WebDS, the first end-to-end web-based data science benchmark consisting of 870 tasks from diverse websites. It addresses the complexity of real-world data science tasks that involve multi-hop interactions and diverse tool-using capabilities. Existing benchmarks focus on simplistic interactions or static datasets, lacking the realism of modern data analytics tasks. Evaluation of state-of-the-art language model agents on WebDS reveals significant performance gaps, indicating the need for improvement in handling complex web-based data science tasks. Browser Use, which performs well on other benchmarks, struggles on WebDS due to new failure modes like poor information grounding and repetitive behavior. By providing a more realistic testing ground, WebDS aims to advance the development of language model-based data science applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex, multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding, repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful LLM-based data science.

Summary:
WarriorMath, a defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving, addresses limitations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, multiple expert LLMs collaborate to generate, refine, and improve problems that base models struggle with. This results in high-quality, defect-aware training data. The training stage employs a progressive learning framework that fine-tunes the model using increasingly challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experimental results on six mathematical benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on average, setting a new state-of-the-art. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework in enhancing mathematical ability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique, and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality, defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving mathematical ability.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness, solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research initiatives.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Large Language Models, Knowledge Graphs, Question Answering, Unseen Entity KGQA

Summary:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes explicit answer evidence, implicit answer clues, and partially relevant information to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs). This study explores the concept of awakening LLMs using partially relevant knowledge already embedded in them, rather than solely relying on external retrieval sources. The research investigates the impact of awakening on LLMs using triplets from gold reasoning paths with removed answer-containing paths. Theoretical analysis and experiments on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets support the effectiveness of this awakening-based approach. Additionally, a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, is introduced to address challenges arising from incomplete knowledge base retrieval. The awakening-based method outperforms traditional embedding-based similarity approaches, particularly in real-world scenarios where entity linking fails due to incomplete KGs. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
1. RAG leverages various types of knowledge to enhance LLMs, including explicit evidence, implicit clues, and partially relevant information.
2. The awakening concept suggests utilizing partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs for improved performance.
3. Experimental results and theoretical analysis support the effectiveness of awakening LLMs.
4. Introduction of the Unseen Entity KGQA task addresses challenges from incomplete knowledge base retrieval.
5. The awakening-based approach shows superiority over traditional methods in scenarios where entity linking fails due to incomplete KGs. <div>
arXiv:2508.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information. Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to returning noisy information.

<div> alignment, knowledge editing, language models, augmentation, inference<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a new method, KEDAS, for knowledge editing in large language models (LLMs). KEDAS aligns LLMs with edited knowledge by utilizing low-rank adaptation in the alignment phase. It incorporates a diverse edit augmentation technique to enhance the recall of edits. A self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, leveraging a smart retriever for dynamic selection of inference routing. KEDAS outperforms existing methods in 35 out of 36 cases across multiple datasets and LLM settings, showing superior performance in edit success, locality, and portability. It proves more efficient and robust while maintaining high performance levels in general tasks. KEDAS presents a promising approach to efficient knowledge editing alignment in language models. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches. In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of 36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models (LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates $\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T $\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms, such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Summary:
The article introduces LinkSyn, a framework for synthesizing diverse question-answering (QA) data to enhance training for large language models (LLMs). LinkSyn utilizes a knowledge point graph to extract KPs from QA seed data and synthesize QA data from multiple sources while balancing coverage and popularity of KPs. By incorporating a knowledge distribution value function, diffusion-based synthesis, and difficulty adjustment mechanisms, LinkSyn creates LinkQA, a multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50 billion tokens. Experiment results on the Llama-3 8B model show that pre-training with LinkQA leads to significant improvements in MMLU and CMMLU metrics. This approach consistently boosts model performance across different scales and demonstrates state-of-the-art results in large language model advancement.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens. Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

<div> Framework, Bias Association, Large Language Models, Social Biases, Evaluation Methods

Summary: 
The Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF) is introduced to tackle social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs). These biases can lead to unfair or distorted representations of demographic groups, impacting the generated language. Existing evaluation methods have limitations in identifying new or unexpected biases. BADF systematically extracts known and previously unnoticed associations between demographic identities and descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through extensive experiments across various models and real-world scenarios, BADF allows for robust mapping and analysis of concepts associated with demographic identities. This framework enhances the understanding of biases in open-ended text generation and offers a scalable tool for detecting and examining bias associations in LLMs. The data, code, and results of the study are accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/JP-25/Discover-Open-Ended-Generation.

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at https://github.com/JP-25/Discover-Open-Ended-Generation

Summary:
ORACLE (Ontology-driven Reasoning And Chain for Logical Elucidation) is a training-free framework that addresses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex multi-hop question answering tasks by combining generative capabilities with knowledge graphs. The framework dynamically constructs question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, transforms them into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and decomposes the query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show competitive performance comparable to state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component and demonstrate that ORACLE generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.<br /><br />Summary: ORACLE is a framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by combining them with knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering, exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities. To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven **R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than existing approaches.

Summary:<br />
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains like medical reasoning often suffers from using unfiltered datasets leading to computational costs and suboptimal performance. A new data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), prioritizes samples with high difficulty and high influence, balancing reasoning complexity with gradient impact. DIQ-selected subsets show higher data quality and generate expert-like clinical reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the baseline. This highlights the effectiveness of principled data selection over brute-force scaling.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However, existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data. Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling.

Summary: 
Syntax-aware diffusion framework proposed for structured domains, such as source code, by incorporating structural priors from ASTs into denoising process. Standard token-level corruption techniques not suitable for code due to strict syntax and semantics. Selective corruption of syntactically meaningful code spans from AST subtrees improves reconstruction accuracy, syntactic correctness, and generalization on unseen code patterns. Model reconstructs programs respecting grammatical boundaries and capturing long-range dependencies. Syntax-guided denoising enhances diffusion-based language models for code generation tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based language models in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Biomedical text mining and question-answering are essential yet highly demanding tasks, particularly in the face of the exponential growth of biomedical literature. In this work, we present our participation in the 13th edition of the BioASQ challenge, which involves biomedical semantic question-answering for Task 13b and biomedical question-answering for developing topics for the Synergy task. We deploy a selection of open-source large language models (LLMs) as retrieval-augmented generators to answer biomedical questions. Various models are used to process the questions. A majority voting system combines their output to determine the final answer for Yes/No questions, while for list and factoid type questions, the union of their answers in used. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open source LLMs, exploring all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable insight into which combinations of LLMs consistently produce superior results for specific question types. In the four rounds of the 2025 BioASQ challenge, our system achieved notable results: in the Synergy task, we secured 1st place for ideal answers and 2nd place for exact answers in round 2, as well as two shared 1st places for exact answers in round 3 and 4.

Summary:<br />
- TeSent is a benchmark dataset for sentiment classification in Telugu, addressing the underrepresentation of the language in NLP and Machine Learning.
- It consists of 26,150 sentences scraped from social media platforms and news websites, with ground truth labels and human-annotated rationales.
- The dataset includes provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, crucial in modern machine learning tasks.
- Fine-tuning SOTA pre-trained models with and without rationales showed potential for accuracy improvement and bias reduction.
- The plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite provides insights into the alignment of model explainers with human reasoning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages, is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources. This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways: with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales, for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly, we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy, reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Cognitive diversity, Language models, Collective intelligence, Homogenization, Marginalization  

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in shaping language and reasoning patterns in society. However, there is a concern that as LLMs become more prevalent, they may standardize language and reasoning processes, potentially marginalizing alternative voices and cognitive strategies. This review discusses how LLMs reflect and reinforce dominant styles while diminishing diversity in language and reasoning. The design and widespread use of LLMs contribute to this homogenization by replicating patterns from their training data and promoting a convergence of language and thinking across different contexts. If left unchecked, this trend could lead to the flattening of cognitive landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability. It is important to consider the potential consequences of this homogenization on creativity and diversity in society. 

<br /><br />Summary: Cognitive diversity is essential for collective intelligence, but large language models (LLMs) may standardize language and reasoning, marginalizing alternative voices and strategies. The design and use of LLMs mirror dominant styles, amplifying convergence in language and thinking. This homogenization poses a risk to cognitive landscapes that foster adaptability and collective intelligence. <div>

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience. Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives, they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities for creating pedagogical agents that engage in meaningful dialogue to support student learning. However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex, non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective, typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously. Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese, using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97) as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

Summary:  
A new automated framework called PromptAnatomy is introduced, which dissects prompts into functional components to generate diverse and interpretable adversarial examples. The framework utilizes a method called ComPerturb to selectively perturb each component of the prompt. It also incorporates a perplexity-based filtering mechanism to ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts. The study highlights the importance of understanding prompt structure and controlled perturbation for evaluating the robustness of large language models. Extensive experiments with advanced language models demonstrate that ComPerturb achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Annotated public instruction-tuning datasets verified through human review are provided as a complementary resource. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of prompt dissection and perplexity filtering in evaluating adversarial robustness in language models. The code and data for PromptAnatomy are available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb. To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced, publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes (PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12 established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act.

Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to the point where distinguishing between machine-generated text and human-written content is becoming increasingly difficult. This study introduces the concept of Multilingual Authorship Attribution, focusing on attributing texts to human or various LLM generators across 18 languages. The research examines the suitability of monolingual authorship attribution methods in a multilingual context, the transferability of these methods across languages, and the impact of different generators on attribution accuracy. Results indicate that while some monolingual methods can be adapted for multilingual use, challenges persist, especially in transferring across diverse language families. This highlights the complexity of multilingual authorship attribution and the need for more robust approaches to address real-world scenarios. <div>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA), i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages -- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

Summary:
The article introduces a new benchmark called CUPID, which consists of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. The benchmark aims to assess the ability of LLMs to infer and apply users' dynamic preferences based on context. The study evaluated 10 LLMs and found that they struggle to accurately infer preferences from multi-turn interactions, achieving less than 50% precision and 65% recall. This highlights the need for advancements in LLM capabilities to enable more contextually personalized interactions. CUPID serves as a resource to drive these improvements and emphasizes the importance of aligning LLM responses with users' changing preferences in different contexts. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

Summary: 
Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to enhance the reasoning quality of Large Language Models by assigning scores to intermediate steps. However, existing PRMs have limitations in leveraging global context. In response, a Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM) is proposed. BiPRM incorporates a bidirectional evaluation paradigm, allowing later reasoning steps to assess earlier ones in real time. The bidirectional evaluation is achieved through prompt modifications without additional parameters or latency. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate BiPRM's superiority over unidirectional baselines, with a significant improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. The findings indicate BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability in process-based reward modeling, offering a promising new direction for enhancing reasoning quality in language models.

However, existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R) evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context, making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory, without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies. We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability, offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

Summary:
The paper introduces Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework aimed at improving the integration of parametric and retrieved knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation models. They propose CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent framework for conditional knowledge induction and reasoning. Building on this, they develop CoCoA, a training strategy to enhance the model's ability to combine parametric and retrieved knowledge effectively. Experiments show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA outperform existing methods on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, sentiment leakage, expression leakage, benchmark dataset, automatic evaluation

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing have advanced skills but can incorporate irrelevant information due to expression leakage, where they generate sentimentally charged expressions unrelated to the input. A benchmark dataset and automatic evaluation pipeline were created to analyze expression leakage, showing that as model size increases, leakage decreases within the same LLM family. Mitigating expression leakage requires careful model building and is not resolved by prompting. Negative sentiment in prompts increases expression leakage more than positive sentiment. This study highlights the need for attention to expression leakage and its impact on LLM performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP) skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher expression leakage rate.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Multilingual, Content Safety, CultureGuard, Safety Guard Models
Summary:
CultureGuard introduces a pipeline for generating culturally aligned safety datasets in multiple languages, expanding the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 to eight languages. The resulting Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1 contains 386,661 samples and is used to train the Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multilingual safety benchmarks. The study shows that open LLMs are more likely to produce unsafe responses in non-English languages, highlighting the need for culturally aware safety guard models. This work addresses the safety gap in multilingual LLMs and represents a significant step towards enhancing content safety across languages.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Summary: 
- Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is crucial for providing satisfactory services.
- Using large language models (LLMs) for fine-tuning task-specific preference extractors shows promising results in accuracy and generalization.
- Obtaining high-quality labeled multi-turn dialogue data is a challenge due to the complexity of tracking user preference transitions.
- The proposed framework, IterChat, decomposes multi-turn preference extraction into iterative one-turn processes to reduce annotation errors and improve efficiency.
- By pre-defining preference slots with GPT4 and generating diverse dialogue datasets, IterChat achieves superior performance and annotator efficiency compared to traditional multi-turn dialogues. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the limitations of current AI-generated text detection methods, which fail to account for positional information of anomalies in text. It highlights the significant non-stationarity in AI-generated text and introduces Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT) as a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by treating discrepancies as a time-series signal. TDT uses Continuous Wavelet Transform to capture both location and linguistic scale of anomalies, leading to improved detection performance on the RAID benchmark. TDT also demonstrates robustness against adversarial attacks, showcasing a 14.1% improvement in AUROC on Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with minimal computational overhead. The study emphasizes the importance of preserving temporal dynamics in detecting anomalies in AI-generated text. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation, ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes, categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical applications.

Summary:  
- The article discusses the lack of semantic benchmarks in Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) and introduces a new Hebrew Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, HeQ.  
- The complex morphology of Hebrew presents challenges in MRC tasks, leading to annotation inconsistencies and flaws in evaluation metrics.  
- The authors propose novel guidelines, a crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics tailored to the morphologically rich nature of Hebrew.  
- Standard evaluation metrics like F1 scores and Exact Match are found to be inappropriate for Hebrew, suggesting the need for enhancements in evaluation methods.  
- Models designed for morpho-syntactic tasks may not perform well on semantic-heavy tasks, indicating the importance of addressing both dimensions in NLP models.  
<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies, disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ (Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM) are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

Summary:
AgenticT2S is a framework designed for Question Answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) in domains such as the circular economy. It addresses challenges related to diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data sources. The framework decomposes KGQA into retrieval, query generation, and verification subtasks managed by specialized agents. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects invalid and underspecified queries through symbolic validation and consistency checks. Experimental results on real-world circular economy KGs show that AgenticT2S significantly improves execution accuracy and triple level F1 over existing baselines while reducing average prompt length. The framework demonstrates the benefits of agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA in sustainability domains, enabling robust cross-graph reasoning for decision-making purposes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains such as the circular economy, where information about classifications, processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval, query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Summary: 

The article introduces a new architecture to address hallucinations in decoder-only LLMs. The proposed model, combining a transformer decoder and an external MLP memory trained to mimic the behavior of a retriever, shows promising results on language modeling and retrieval tasks. The architecture demonstrates improved performance on various datasets, showcasing a significant enhancement in model scalability compared to decoder-only models. The approach effectively handles hallucinations and memory-intensive tasks, outperforming existing methods like $k$NN-LM. Moreover, the external memory leads to improved reasoning capabilities in tasks like StrategyQA. The model not only achieves impressive results but also offers faster inference times, making it a practical solution for knowledge-intensive applications. The code and models will be made available open-source, facilitating further research and applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks. Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained, differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers $80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models in the future.

arXiv:2508.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore, we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.

<div> hallucination, language models, counterfactual probing, detection, mitigation  
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in various tasks but often produce hallucinated outputs with factual errors. A new approach called Counterfactual Probing is proposed to detect and reduce these hallucinations in LLM outputs. By creating counterfactual statements with subtle factual errors and analyzing the model's response, the method aims to identify inaccuracies in the generated content. This approach, without requiring model retraining, detects hallucinations more effectively than existing methods. Through adaptive mitigation strategies, hallucination scores are reduced by an average of 24.5%, enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs. The technique can be seamlessly integrated into current LLM workflows as a real-time verification tool, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of generated content. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods, while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

<div> Quantum-RAG, Punjabi, large language models, low-resource languages, retrieval-augmented generation

Summary:
PunGPT2 and Pun-RAG are introduced as open-source Punjabi language models trained on a diverse corpus. PunGPT2 captures unique syntactic and morphological features while Pun-RAG improves factual grounding with a dense retriever. Pun-Instruct is a parameter-efficient variant enhancing zero-shot performance. Quantum-RAG combines sparse and dense retrieval methods with quantum-inspired semantic matching for improved contextual relevance. These models outperform multilingual baselines in perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches, PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall, we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable, reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Learning from Human Feedback, Lexical preferences, Lexical overuse, Alignment research

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been observed to overuse specific terms like "delve" and "intricate," with the reasons behind these lexical choices previously unclear. This study utilizes Meta's Llama model to investigate the role of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), encompassing techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization. A method is introduced to detect LLMs' lexical preferences influenced by LHF. Experimentally emulating the LHF process confirms a systematic preference for text variants containing certain words, highlighting a potential misalignment between LHF workers and LLM users' lexical expectations. The research contributes to the field of explainable artificial intelligence, emphasizing the significance of data transparency and procedural clarity in alignment studies. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve" and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization. We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural transparency in alignment research.

<div> framework, reasoning, video, trajectory, ROVER
Summary:
ROVER is a framework designed to improve the performance of vision-language models in reasoning over long video sequences in embodied settings. It decomposes video trajectories into segments corresponding to subtasks, allowing for more focused reasoning without losing global context. The framework, implemented using in-context learning, outperforms strong baselines in three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. By reducing the number of frames considered at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations and improves performance during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. It also features a subtask-specific sliding context window, resulting in linear time complexity with video length, which is an improvement over baselines. The evaluation on diverse datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ROVER in enhancing the capabilities of vision-language models in handling long-horizon video sequences. <div>
arXiv:2508.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

<div> Keywords: retrieval-augmented generation, long documents, contextual information, embedding models, SitEmb

Summary:
In the field of retrieval-augmented generation, handling long documents poses a challenge as splitting them into smaller chunks may lead to loss of contextual information. Existing approaches to encoding longer context windows have limitations in improving retrieval and downstream tasks. To address this, a new approach is introduced where short chunks are represented conditioned on a broader context window to enhance retrieval performance. The proposed SitEmb models are designed to effectively encode situated context, outperforming existing embedding models in a book-plot retrieval dataset. The SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3 demonstrates superior performance with only 1B parameters compared to larger models. The SitEmb-v1.5 model further enhances performance by over 10% across different languages and downstream applications.<br /><br />Summary: The article discusses challenges in retrieval-augmented generation with long documents and proposes a novel approach to enhance retrieval performance by representing short chunks within a broader context. The SitEmb models are introduced to effectively encode situated context, outperforming existing embedding models in a curated benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval capabilities, even with lower parameter counts, across various languages and downstream applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document, contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context. We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across different languages and several downstream applications.

Abstract: To address the severe data scarcity in Tibetan, a low-resource language spoken by over six million people, we introduce TIBSTC-CoT, the large-scale, multi-domain Tibetan dataset automatically constructed via chain-of-thought prompting with large language models (LLMs). TIBSTC-CoT establishes a scalable and reproducible framework for dataset creation in low-resource settings, covering diverse domains and reasoning patterns essential for language understanding and generation. Building on this dataset, we develop the Sunshine-thinking LLM family, a series of Tibetan-centric LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought capabilities. Trained entirely on TIBSTC-CoT, Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance, comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a significant step toward inclusive AI by enabling high-quality Tibetan language processing through both resource creation and model innovation.

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications, unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively. We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective, subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task 3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem, differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing. Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing research and to foster further developments in this field.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models. SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval, procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

<title>Diagnosing Memorization in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, One Token at a Time</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

<title>Harnessing Temporal Databases for Systematic Evaluation of Factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor, complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop question generation. Code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/ssoy0701/tdbench.git.

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce concise, high-performing prompts.

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test (SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models, and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and guides the development of new methods to combat it.

<title>When Truth Is Overridden: Uncovering the Internal Origins of Sycophancy in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2508.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence. We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts (``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment and truthful AI systems.

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity detection.

arXiv:2508.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining, producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications. Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and (iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller, shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and WandB logs are released.

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto frontier for code models.

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly, leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456 challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations, predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting fairness, inclusivity, and alignment.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to obtain optimal performance.

<title>Decomposing the Entropy-Performance Exchange: The Missing Keys to Unlocking Effective Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing, particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024 architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0} when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and intercultural communication.

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed, and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community contributions and dataset evolution.

Abstract: We present the first French partition of the OLDI Seed Corpus, our submission to the WMT 2025 Open Language Data Initiative (OLDI) shared task. We detail its creation process, which involved using multiple machine translation systems and a custom-built interface for post-editing by qualified native speakers. We also highlight the unique translation challenges presented by the source data, which combines highly technical, encyclopedic terminology with the stylistic irregularities characteristic of user-generated content taken from Wikipedia. This French corpus is not an end in itself, but is intended as a crucial pivot resource to facilitate the collection of parallel corpora for the under-resourced regional languages of France.

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base. Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of \textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications (Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

<title>LaMPE: Length-aware Multi-grained Position Encoding for Adaptive Long-context Scaling Without Training</title>

arXiv:2508.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length extrapolation methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end omni-modal training. %
We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of new modalities with minimal code change. %
Using \veomni, a omni-modal mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over 2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for training large omni-modal LLMs.

<title>CAMERA: Multi-Matrix Joint Compression for MoE Models via Micro-Expert Redundancy Analysis</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

<title>Understanding and Mitigating Political Stance Cross-topic Generalization in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning. Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons: general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method, effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the cross-topic stance generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/CompressKV.git.

<title>Learning to Evolve: Bayesian-Guided Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios, traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs. Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem, we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly, we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article equips R&amp;D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors, with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so, we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection, prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable, increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring innovation.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3 percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable, requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric, making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising. During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags, and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse, and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political mobilization in the digital age.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds). Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs. Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving arithmetic tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation, and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15 open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought. Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally constrained literary texts.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that, while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to do so.

<title>Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction</title>

arXiv:2508.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.

Abstract: In a world overwhelmed with news, determining which information comes from reliable sources or how neutral is the reported information in the news articles poses a challenge to news readers. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatically identifying bias by commission, omission, and source selection (COSS) as a joint three-fold objective, as opposed to the previous work separately addressing these types of bias. In a pipeline concept, we describe the goals and tasks of its steps toward bias identification and provide an example of a visualization that leverages the extracted features and patterns of text reuse.

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages, which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure. Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively. Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it is able to do this at the event level.

<title>Automated SNOMED CT Concept Annotation in Clinical Text Using Bi-GRU Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models, making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

<title>Sparse-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs with Dynamic Cache Eviction</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

<title>Guess or Recall? Training CNNs to Classify and Localize Memorization in LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories: memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights involved in each form of memorization.

<title>EHSAN: Leveraging ChatGPT in a Hybrid Framework for Arabic Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Healthcare</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02574</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment. To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes, with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

<title>MArgE: Meshing Argumentative Evidence from Multiple Large Language Models for Justifiable Claim Verification</title>

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However, current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions, providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models (4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining multiple LLM outputs.

<title>CharBench: Evaluating the Role of Tokenization in Character-Level Tasks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization, leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of 43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character, suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs. We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

<title>Mitigating Attention Hacking in Preference-Based Reward Modeling via Interaction Distillation</title>

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose "Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention, and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$ complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves $2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers, maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models. However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional, heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing 2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness. Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters, identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Web-enabled LLMs frequently answer queries without crediting the web pages they consume, creating an "attribution gap" - the difference between relevant URLs read and those actually cited. Drawing on approximately 14,000 real-world LMArena conversation logs with search-enabled LLM systems, we document three exploitation patterns: 1) No Search: 34% of Google Gemini and 24% of OpenAI GPT-4o responses are generated without explicitly fetching any online content; 2) No citation: Gemini provides no clickable citation source in 92% of answers; 3) High-volume, low-credit: Perplexity's Sonar visits approximately 10 relevant pages per query but cites only three to four. A negative binomial hurdle model shows that the average query answered by Gemini or Sonar leaves about 3 relevant websites uncited, whereas GPT-4o's tiny uncited gap is best explained by its selective log disclosures rather than by better attribution. Citation efficiency - extra citations provided per additional relevant web page visited - varies widely across models, from 0.19 to 0.45 on identical queries, underscoring that retrieval design, not technical limits, shapes ecosystem impact. We recommend a transparent LLM search architecture based on standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs.

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation. However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

<title>Filtering with Self-Attention and Storing with MLP: One-Layer Transformers Can Provably Acquire and Extract Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract (retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque. While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer, attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction. We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied, transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate our results.

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models, including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments, particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1% absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model, Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining, making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%, respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of database systems is critical to ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&amp;M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&amp;M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&amp;M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&amp;M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

<title>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However, existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW, the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities, although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and efficient multimodal architectures.

<title>ConfGuard: A Simple and Effective Backdoor Detection for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs), where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs, thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation. Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR) in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor defense for real-world LLM deployments.

<title>ChEmbed: Enhancing Chemical Literature Search Through Domain-Specific Text Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However, general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality. Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries, resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs. Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens. Evaluated on our newly introduced ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark, ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art general embedding models, raising nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp). ChEmbed represents a practical, lightweight, and reproducible embedding solution that effectively improves retrieval for chemical literature search.

<title>DUP: Detection-guided Unlearning for Backdoor Purification in Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01647</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy. Our code is available at https://github.com/ManHu2025/DUP.

Abstract: We present Voxlect, a novel benchmark for modeling dialects and regional languages worldwide using speech foundation models. Specifically, we report comprehensive benchmark evaluations on dialects and regional language varieties in English, Arabic, Mandarin and Cantonese, Tibetan, Indic languages, Thai, Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Italian. Our study used over 2 million training utterances from 30 publicly available speech corpora that are provided with dialectal information. We evaluate the performance of several widely used speech foundation models in classifying speech dialects. We assess the robustness of the dialectal models under noisy conditions and present an error analysis that highlights modeling results aligned with geographic continuity. In addition to benchmarking dialect classification, we demonstrate several downstream applications enabled by Voxlect. Specifically, we show that Voxlect can be applied to augment existing speech recognition datasets with dialect information, enabling a more detailed analysis of ASR performance across dialectal variations. Voxlect is also used as a tool to evaluate the performance of speech generation systems. Voxlect is publicly available with the license of the RAIL family at: https://github.com/tiantiaf0627/voxlect.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step, thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However, training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/UnPRM.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and 527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model (Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic, tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed, centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline, and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in keypoint-based CSLR.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4) % accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4 $\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity. Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100 billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of replaying old examples.

<title>A Decentralized Framework for Ethical Authorship Validation in Academic Publishing: Leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain Technology</title>

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications, increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way? Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to ``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing. Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding model internals and building circuits.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Abstract: In recent years, many companies have recognized the importance of human resources and are investing in human capital to revitalize their organizations and enhance internal communication, thereby fostering innovation. However, conventional quantification methods have mainly focused on readily measurable indicators without addressing the fundamental role of conversations in human capital. This study focuses on routine meetings and proposes strategies to visualize human capital by analyzing speech amount during these meetings. We employ conversation visualization technology, which operates effectively, to quantify speech. We then measure differences in speech amount by attributes such as gender and job post, changes in speech amount depending on whether certain participants are present, and correlations between speech amount and continuous attributes. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we analyzed speech amounts by departmental affiliation during weekly meetings at small to medium enterprises.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational complexity of important information while retaining complete information, achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings. Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods. Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability effectively.

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters, making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix, \underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Abstract: As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates: Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features. HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise. These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II) ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features, particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III) poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations, highlighting the attack's stealth.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/LeanK.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/CellForge.

Abstract: This paper proposes to refer to the field of software engineering related to the life cycle of dialogue systems as Dialogue Systems Engineering, and surveys this field while also discussing its future directions. With the advancement of large language models, the core technologies underlying dialogue systems have significantly progressed. As a result, dialogue system technology is now expected to be applied to solving various societal issues and in business contexts. To achieve this, it is important to build, operate, and continuously improve dialogue systems correctly and efficiently. Accordingly, in addition to applying existing software engineering knowledge, it is becoming increasingly important to evolve software engineering tailored specifically to dialogue systems. In this paper, we enumerate the knowledge areas of dialogue systems engineering based on those of software engineering, as defined in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Version 4.0, and survey each area. Based on this survey, we identify unexplored topics in each area and discuss the future direction of dialogue systems engineering.

<title>CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Verifiable Generative Credit Assignment</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning (RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) deliver personalised recommendations through multi-turn natural language dialogue and increasingly support both task-oriented and exploratory interactions. Yet, the factors shaping user interaction preferences remain underexplored. In this within-subjects study (\(N = 139\)), participants experienced two scripted CRS dialogues, rated their experiences, and indicated the importance of eight system qualities. Logistic regression revealed that preference for the exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced these choices. These findings integrate affective, cognitive, and trait-level predictors into CRS user modelling and inform autonomy-sensitive, value-adaptive dialogue design. The proposed predictive and adaptive framework applies broadly to conversational AI systems seeking to align dynamically with evolving user needs.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

<title>Six Guidelines for Trustworthy, Ethical and Responsible Automation Design</title>

Abstract: Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for their safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a system recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is factually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate trustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make informed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system (Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers optimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and responsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived from existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics. We are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically the cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication maxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated systems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped by both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal norms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or scenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed guidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated systems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally foster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe interactions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed heuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems enable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.

<title>Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination via Attention Lens</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs, generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens, balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions. Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting its generalizability and efficacy.

Abstract: While many tools are available for designing AI, non-experts still face challenges in clearly expressing their intent and managing system complexity. We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input with visual workflows. AIAP leverages a coordinated multi-agent system to decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers and enhances user experience in AI service design.

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to 92\% on the most complex problems.

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors) disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces. We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with AS.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance, but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia, animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents. However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Abstract: Small language models like T5 excel in generating high-quality text for data-to-text tasks, offering adaptability and cost-efficiency compared to Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they frequently miss keywords, which is considered one of the most severe and common errors in this task. In this work, we explore the potential of using feedback systems to enhance semantic fidelity in smaller language models for data-to-text generation tasks, through our Verification and Correction Prompting (VCP) approach. In the inference stage, our approach involves a multi-step process, including generation, verification, and regeneration stages. During the verification stage, we implement a simple rule to check for the presence of every keyword in the prediction. Recognizing that this rule can be inaccurate, we have developed a carefully designed training procedure, which enabling the model to incorporate feedback from the error-correcting prompt effectively, despite its potential inaccuracies. The VCP approach effectively reduces the Semantic Error Rate (SER) while maintaining the text's quality.

However, prior work on LLM-based machine translation has mainly focused on better utilizing training data, demonstrations, or pre-defined and universal knowledge to improve performance, with a lack of consideration of decision-making like human translators. In this paper, we incorporate Thinker with the Drift-Diffusion Model (Thinker-DDM) to address this issue. We then redefine the Drift-Diffusion process to emulate human translators' dynamic decision-making under constrained resources. We conduct extensive experiments under the high-resource, low-resource, and commonsense translation settings using the WMT22 and CommonMT datasets, in which Thinker-DDM outperforms baselines in the first two scenarios. We also perform additional analysis and evaluation on commonsense translation to illustrate the high effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across diverse settings, but still struggle as the length and complexity of the context increases. To address this challenge, we propose Thinking Recursively and Dynamically (ThReaD). THREAD frames model generation as a thread of execution that, based on the context, can run to completion or dynamically spawn new threads. By spawning, threads can offload work (e.g., thinking, retrieving information) to child threads, which only return tokens needed for the parent thread to do its work. In effect, this enables the model to adapt, as needed, the amount of intermediate work used to produce tokens. We apply THREAD in the settings of LLM task solving and question answering, where the dynamic threading allows the model to recursively decompose the given task or question into progressively simpler sub-problems that can be solved by separate child threads. We test THREAD, implemented using a few-shot learning approach, on diverse benchmarks for agent tasks and data-grounded question answering. THREAD achieves state-of-the-art performance with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 on these benchmarks, including ALFWorld, TextCraft, and WebShop, along with two new benchmarks, DataCommons QA and MIMIC-III ICU QA. In addition, THREAD outperforms existing frameworks by 10% to 50% absolute points with smaller models, including Llama-3-8b and CodeLlama-7b.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) assesses sentiments towards specific aspects within texts, resulting in detailed sentiment tuples. Previous ABSA models often use static templates to predict all of the elements in the tuples, and these models often fail to accurately capture dependencies between elements. Multi-view prompting method improves the performance of ABSA by predicting tuples with various templates and then ensembling the results. However, this method suffers from inefficiencies and out-of-distribution errors. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Order Template (DOT) method for ABSA, which dynamically generates necessary views for each instance based on instance-level entropy. Ensuring the diverse and relevant view generation, our proposed method improves F1-scores on ASQP and ACOS datasets while significantly reducing inference time.

Abstract: Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with tools have allowed the models to interact with real-world environments. However, these tool-augmented LLMs often encounter incomplete scenarios when users provide partial information or the necessary tools are unavailable. Recognizing and managing such scenarios is crucial for LLMs to ensure their reliability, but this exploration remains understudied. This study examines whether LLMs can identify incomplete conditions and appropriately determine when to refrain from using tools. To quantitatively evaluate this capability, we construct a new benchmark dataset where instances are systematically altered to simulate the ambiguous and incomplete conditions common in real-world interactions. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art LLMs often struggle to identify these conditions, attempting to use tools without sufficient information or when the correct tool is unavailable. To better understand these limitations, we conduct a detailed behavioral analysis across various conditions, including implicit evaluation and scenarios where models receive feedback from previous tool invocations. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel prompting-based reasoning strategy that explicitly instructs models to assess the sufficiency of information and the availability of tools. Our proposed approach significantly enhances the models' ability to recognize incomplete conditions, resulting in more informed and contextually appropriate tool-use decisions. We believe our research contributes to advancing the reliability of LLMs, especially in real-world applications where incomplete or ambiguous information is common. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ddehun/ICT.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is essential for their applications. Recently, decoding-time alignment has emerged as an effective plug-and-play technique that avoids fine-tuning model parameters. This approach retains the general utility of pretrained LLMs but often suffers from significant inefficiencies during decoding, primarily due to wasted token generation and excessive reward evaluations. To address these challenges, we introduce Cascade Reward Sampling (CARDS) to resolve both efficiency bottlenecks in decoding-time alignment. Specifically, we develop a segment-level rejection sampling algorithm that minimizes redundant computations of both LLMs and reward models (RMs). Central to CARDS is an uncertainty-based segmentation mechanism, which ensures the accuracy of RMs evaluations on incomplete segments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of reward scores on segments to elucidate the improved alignment performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CARDS significantly improves decoding efficiency, alignment quality, and general utility compared to existing decoding-time alignment methods, achieving approximately a 70% reduction in decoding time and over 90% win-ties in utility and safety benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified graph representation learning aims to generate node embeddings, which can be applied to multiple downstream applications of graph analytics. However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needs toward specific downstream predictions, poor generalization, or shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to efficiently learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of four well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which can cover key connections between different dense groups. An in-depth analysis and comparison of different path selections is conducted to justify the rationale behind our designed L2SP method. Next, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts with key phrase selection from node text attributes. We then feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to align next node/edge generation in L2SP with next token generation in causal language modeling for graph representation learning and finally extract the unified graph embeddings. We theoretically analyze the algorithm complexity of our Path-LLM approach. Extensive experiments on large-scale graph benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against state-of-the-art methods WalkLM, GraphGPT, OFA, and GraphTranslator on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and edge validation) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search). Compared with WalkLM, our approach saves more than 90% of training paths on millions-scale graphs and runs at most 35x faster.

Abstract: Generative models have become widely used in biomedical entity linking (BioEL) due to their excellent performance and efficient memory usage. However, these models are usually trained only with positive samples, i.e., entities that match the input mention's identifier, and do not explicitly learn from hard negative samples, which are entities that look similar but have different meanings. To address this limitation, we introduce ANGEL (Learning from Negative Samples in Biomedical Generative Entity Linking), the first framework that trains generative BioEL models using negative samples. Specifically, a generative model is initially trained to generate positive entity names from the knowledge base for given input entities. Subsequently, both correct and incorrect outputs are gathered from the model's top-k predictions. Finally, the model is updated to prioritize the correct predictions through preference optimization. Our models outperform the previous best baseline models by up to an average top-1 accuracy of 1.4% on five benchmarks. When incorporating our framework into pre-training, the performance improvement increases further to 1.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/ANGEL.

Abstract: To broaden the dissemination of scientific knowledge to diverse audiences, it is desirable for scientific document summarization systems to simultaneously control multiple attributes such as length and empirical focus. However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, the first evaluation benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., conceptual or empirical focus), which are more subjective and abstract. We conduct extensive experiments using various large language models (LLMs) under various settings, including in-context learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and two-stage modular methods for balancing control over different attributes. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs capabilities in balancing trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) expand across domains, LLM judges have become essential for systems evaluation. Current benchmarks typically compare system outputs against baselines. This baseline-mediated approach, though convenient, yields lower reliability than direct comparison between systems. We propose Arena-Lite which integrates tournament structure on top of head-to-head comparison. The application of a tournament structure and direct comparison eliminates the need for baseline outputs, reduces the number of required comparisons, and allows higher reliability in system rankings. We conducted two experiments: (1) controlled stochastic modeling and (2) empirical validation with a real LLM judge. Those experiments collectively demonstrate that Arena-Lite consistently achieves higher reliability with fewer comparisons, even with smaller datasets or weaker judges. We release an easy-to-use web demonstration and code to foster adoption of Arena-Lite, streamlining model selection across research and industry communities. Arena-Lite demo and code are available on \href{https://huggingface.co/spaces/NCSOFT/ArenaLite}{https://huggingface.co/spaces/NCSOFT/ArenaLite}

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving. This deficiency stems from the critical scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for cultivating sophisticated reasoning abilities. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel and scalable paradigm that harnesses frontier LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which in turn synthesize a virtually infinite stream of high-quality problems and solutions. Using this paradigm, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a foundational dataset of over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a programmatically verifiable solution, offering an unprecedented level of quality at scale. This resource not only resolves the data scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning but also provides a robust mechanism for model alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Our approach elevates data augmentation by employing GPT-4 for meta-template creation, guaranteeing diverse and complex problem structures. By providing a scalable solution to the data and verification bottleneck, TDG and TemplateGSM pave the way for a new generation of LLMs with powerful, reliable reasoning skills. The code and data are available at https://github.com/iiis-ai/TemplateMath.

<title>Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer Attention Similarity</title>

Abstract: The rapid expansion of context window sizes in Large Language Models~(LLMs) has enabled them to tackle increasingly complex tasks involving lengthy documents. However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase in memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the key-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less relevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when critical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \textsc{PoD}~(Proximal tokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that allocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens in a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our approach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at the beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for next-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly redundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \textsc{PoD} preserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it shares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both queries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single set of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without discarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training adaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing structure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and real-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{PoD} reduces KV cache memory usage by up to 35\% without compromising performance. Our method is orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined with them for further KV cache compression.

<title>Core Context Aware Transformers for Long Context Language Modeling</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in extensive tasks primarily attributed to self-attention mechanism, which requires a token to consider all preceding tokens as its context to compute attention. However, when the context length L becomes very large (e.g., 128K), the amount of potentially redundant information in the context tends to increase. The redundant context not only hampers the modeling representation performance but also incurs unnecessary computational and storage overhead. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play Core Context Aware (CCA) Attention for efficient long-context modeling, comprising two complementary modules: 1) Globality-aware pooling module groups input tokens and dynamically compresses each group into one core token based on their significance. In this way, our method automatically focuses and strengthens core context while diminishing redundancy during the learning process, leading to effective long-term dependency modeling. 2) Locality-preserving module incorporates neighboring tokens to preserve local context for detailed representation. Notably, our CCA-Attention is able to replace the self-attention module in existing LLMs with minimal fine-tuning cost. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method in both long-context modeling and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Document-level relation extraction (Doc-RE) aims to extract relations between entities across multiple sentences. Therefore, Doc-RE requires more comprehensive reasoning abilities like humans, involving complex cross-sentence interactions between entities, contexts, and external general knowledge, compared to the sentence-level RE. However, most existing Doc-RE methods focus on optimizing single reasoning ability, but lack the ability to utilize external knowledge for comprehensive reasoning on long documents. To solve these problems, a knowledge retrieval augmented method, named KnowRA, was proposed with comprehensive reasoning to autonomously determine whether to accept external knowledge to assist DocRE. Firstly, we constructed a document graph for semantic encoding and integrated the co-reference resolution model to augment the co-reference reasoning ability. Then, we expanded the document graph into a document knowledge graph by retrieving the external knowledge base for common-sense reasoning and a novel knowledge filtration method was presented to filter out irrelevant knowledge. Finally, we proposed the axis attention mechanism to build direct and indirect associations with intermediary entities for achieving cross-sentence logical reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets verified the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowRA.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical challenge: providing feedback for tasks where human evaluation is difficult or where LLMs potentially outperform humans. In such scenarios, leveraging the critique ability of LLMs themselves - identifying and correcting flaws - shows considerable promise. This paper explores enhancing critique abilities of LLMs, noting that current approaches rely on human annotations or more powerful models, leaving the challenge of improving critique abilities without external supervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework that trains LLMs with self-generated data to evolve their critique abilities. To address the low quality of naively generated data, we propose a contrastive-critic approach that uses reference solutions during data synthesis to enhance the model's understanding of key concepts, and incorporates a self-validation scheme to ensure data quality. The final trained model operates without any reference solutions at inference time. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, a leading LLM, SCRIT demonstrates consistent improvements across a wide range of benchmarks spanning both mathematical and scientific reasoning: achieving a 10.0\% relative gain in critique-correction accuracy and a 19.0\% relative improvement in error identification F1-score. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales positively with data and model size and enables continuous improvement through multi-round iterations.

Abstract: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection. We open-source the project and our models.

Abstract: The GPT-4 technical report highlights the possibility of predicting model performance on downstream tasks using only pre-training signals, though detailed methodologies are absent. Such predictive capabilities are essential for resource-efficient pre-training and the construction of task-aligned datasets. In this paper, we aim to predict performance in closed-book question answering (QA), a vital downstream task that directly reflects a model's internalized knowledge without the help of external tools. We address three primary challenges: (1) limited access to and understanding of pre-training corpora, (2) limitations of current evaluation methods for pre-trained models, and (3) limitations of frequency-based metrics in predicting model performance. In response, we conduct large-scale retrieval and semantic analysis across the pre-training corpora of 21 publicly available and 3 custom-trained large language models. We then develop a multi-template QA evaluation framework incorporating paraphrased question variants. Building on these foundations, we propose Size-dependent Mutual Information (SMI), an information-theoretic metric that linearly correlates pre-training data characteristics, model size, and QA accuracy, without requiring additional training. Experimental results show that SMI outperforms co-occurrence-based baselines, achieving $R^2 > 0.75$ on models with over one billion parameters. Theoretical analysis further suggests an upper bound of around 80% QA accuracy under optimal pre-training, reflecting intrinsic memory limitations and motivating the use of retrieval or few-shot methods in later stages.

Abstract: In this work, we argue that large language models (LLMs), though trained to predict only the next token, exhibit emergent planning behaviors: $\textbf{their hidden representations encode future outputs beyond the next token}$. Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structure attributes}$ (e.g., response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (e.g., character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavior attributes}$ (e.g., answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggest potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Dealing with this trade-off is still an open challenge in designing AI systems for creativity. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We show that our score can be used as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments considering a variety of creative tasks, such as poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TableQA) attracts strong interests due to the prevalence of web information presented in the form of semi-structured tables. Despite many efforts, TableQA over large tables remains an open challenge. This is because large tables may overwhelm models that try to comprehend them in full to locate question answers. Recent studies reduce input table size by decomposing tables into smaller, question-relevant sub-tables via generating programs to parse the tables. However, such solutions are subject to program generation and execution errors and are difficult to ensure decomposition quality. To address this issue, we propose TaDRe, a TableQA model that incorporates both pre- and post-table decomposition refinements to ensure table decomposition quality, hence achieving highly accurate TableQA results. To evaluate TaDRe, we construct two new large-table TableQA benchmarks via LLM-driven table expansion and QA pair generation. Extensive experiments on both the new and public benchmarks show that TaDRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-table TableQA tasks.

Abstract: Despite their growing capabilities, language models still frequently reproduce content from their training data, generate repetitive text, and favor common grammatical patterns and vocabulary. A possible cause is the decoding strategy: the most common strategies either consider only the most probable tokens, which reduces output diversity, or increase the likelihood of unlikely tokens, compromising output accuracy and correctness. In this paper, we propose DiffSampling, a new decoding method that leverages a mathematical analysis of the token probability distribution to ensure the generation of contextually appropriate text. In particular, the difference between consecutive, sorted probabilities can be used to truncate incorrect tokens. In addition, we also propose two variations of the proposed method that aim to correct the subtle inconsistencies of common sampling strategies. Experiments involving four different text-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach consistently performs at least on par with the existing methods it builds upon in terms of quality, while potentially improving output diversity.

<title>Control Illusion: The Failure of Instruction Hierarchies in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with hierarchical instruction schemes, where certain instructions (e.g., system-level directives) are expected to take precedence over others (e.g., user messages). Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of how effectively these hierarchical control mechanisms work. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework based on constraint prioritization to assess how well LLMs enforce instruction hierarchies. Our experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that models struggle with consistent instruction prioritization, even for simple formatting conflicts. We find that the widely-adopted system/user prompt separation fails to establish a reliable instruction hierarchy, and models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraint types regardless of their priority designation. We find that LLMs more reliably obey constraints framed through natural social hierarchies (e.g., authority, expertise, consensus) than system/user roles, which suggests that pretraining-derived social structures act as latent control priors, with potentially stronger influence than post-training guardrails.

Abstract: The culture of the Post-Soviet states is complex, shaped by a turbulent history that continues to influence current events. In this study, we investigate the Post-Soviet cultural food knowledge of foundation models by constructing BORSch, a multimodal dataset encompassing 1147 and 823 dishes in the Russian and Ukrainian languages, centered around the Post-Soviet region. We demonstrate that leading models struggle to correctly identify the origins of dishes from Post-Soviet nations in both text-only and multimodal Question Answering (QA), instead over-predicting countries linked to the language the question is asked in. Through analysis of pretraining data, we show that these results can be explained by misleading dish-origin co-occurrences, along with linguistic phenomena such as Russian-Ukrainian code mixing. Finally, to move beyond QA-based assessments, we test models' abilities to produce accurate visual descriptions of dishes. The weak correlation between this task and QA suggests that QA alone may be insufficient as an evaluation of cultural understanding. To foster further research, we will make BORSch publicly available at https://github.com/alavrouk/BORSch.

<title>Predictive Data Selection: The Data That Predicts Is the Data That Teaches</title>

Abstract: Language model pretraining involves training on extensive corpora, where data quality plays a pivotal role. In this work, we aim to directly estimate the contribution of data during pretraining and select pretraining data in an efficient manner. Specifically, we draw inspiration from recent findings showing that compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss) of diverse models on certain text correlates strongly with their downstream performance, when the text domain aligns with the downstream benchmarks(Huang et al., 2024). Building on this observation, we hypothesize that data on which model losses are predictive of downstream abilities also contribute effectively to learning, which shares similar intuition with Thrush et al.(2024). To leverage this insight, we introduce predictive data selection (PreSelect), a lightweight and efficient data selection method that requires training and deploying only a fastText-based scorer. Through comprehensive experiments with 1B and 3B parameter models, we demonstrate that models trained on 30B tokens selected with PreSelect surpass the performance of the vanilla baseline trained on 300B tokens, achieving a 10x reduction in compute requirements. Furthermore, PreSelect significantly outperforms other competitive data selection baselines, such as DCLM and FineWeb-Edu on a scale of 3B models trained on 100B tokens. We open-source our trained data selection scorer along with the curated datasets at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/PreSelect.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a widely adopted approach for knowledge injection during large language model (LLM) inference in recent years. However, due to their limited ability to exploit fine-grained inter-document relationships, current RAG implementations face challenges in effectively addressing the retrieved noise and redundancy content, which may cause error in the generation results. To address these limitations, we propose an Efficient Dynamic Clustering-based document Compression framework (EDC2-RAG) that utilizes latent inter-document relationships while simultaneously removing irrelevant information and redundant content. We validate our approach, built upon GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, on widely used knowledge-QA and Hallucination-Detection datasets. Experimental results show that our method achieves consistent performance improvements across various scenarios and experimental settings, demonstrating strong robustness and applicability. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/EDC-2-RAG.

<title>Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs</title>

Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities on various tasks. However, LRMs often suffer from an ``overthinking'' problem, where the model generates excessively redundant reasoning steps with limited performance gains. In this work, we empirically reveal an important characteristic of LRM behaviors that placing external CoTs generated by smaller models between the thinking token (\texttt{} and \texttt{}) can effectively manipulate the model to generate fewer thoughts. Building on this finding, we propose a simple yet efficient pipeline, \Method, to enable LRMs to bypass unnecessary intermediate steps, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the utility and efficiency of \Method. For instance, when applied to QwQ-32B on the LiveBench/Code dataset, \Method keeps the original performance while reducing output token counts by approximately 30\%, with minimal overhead introduced by the CoT generator. Furthermore, we identify two suboptimal modes, blindly following flawed external thoughts and unnecessary rethinking, and show that simple mitigations, such as difficulty-aware fallbacks, can further improve performance. Overall, \Method offers a practical, general, and efficient way to optimize LRM inference, making powerful reasoning models more accessible and scalable for real-world applications.

<title>Agree to Disagree? A Meta-Evaluation of LLM Misgendering</title>

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to measure LLM misgendering, including probability-based evaluations (e.g., automatically with templatic sentences) and generation-based evaluations (e.g., with automatic heuristics or human validation). However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation, which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.

<title>Do MLLMs Capture How Interfaces Guide User Behavior? A Benchmark for Multimodal UI/UX Design Understanding</title>

Abstract: User interface (UI) design goes beyond visuals, guiding user behavior and overall user experience (UX). Strategically crafted interfaces, for example, can boost sign-ups and drive business sales, underscoring the shift toward UI/UX as a unified design concept. While recent studies have explored UI quality evaluation using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they largely focus on surface-level features, overlooking behavior-oriented aspects. To fill this gap, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a novel benchmark for assessing models' multimodal understanding of UI/UX design. It includes 300 diverse real-world UI image pairs, each consisting of two design variants A/B-tested at scale by actual companies, where one was empirically validated to steer more user actions than the other. Each pair is accompanied one or more of 684 expert-curated rationales that capture key factors behind each winning design's effectiveness, spanning diverse cognitive dimensions of UX. Our benchmark supports two core tasks: (1) selecting the more effective UI/UX design by predicting the A/B test verified winner and (2) assessing how well a model, given the winner, can explain its effectiveness in alignment with expert reasoning. Experiments across several MLLMs show that current models exhibit limited nuanced reasoning about UI/UX design and its behavioral impact. We believe our work will foster research in UI/UX understanding and enable broader applications such as behavior-aware interface optimization.

Abstract: Large language models often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet, we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information, a method we call general knowledge subtraction (GenKnowSub). Leveraging the refined task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm \citep{ostapenko2024towards}, we dynamically select and combine modules for new inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 demonstrate how GenKnowSub generalizes to weaker LLMs. The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/saharsamr/Modular-LLM.

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in academic workflows, their capabilities remain limited when it comes to supporting high-quality scientific writing. Most existing systems are designed for general-purpose scientific text generation and fail to meet the sophisticated demands of research communication beyond surface-level polishing, such as conceptual coherence across sections. Furthermore, academic writing is inherently iterative and revision-driven, a process not well supported by direct prompting-based paradigms. To address these scenarios, we propose a human-AI collaboration framework for academic paper revision. We first introduce a comprehensive dataset of 7,040 research papers from top-tier venues annotated with over 140,000 instruction-response pairs that reflect realistic, section-level scientific revisions. Building on the dataset, we develop XtraGPT, the first suite of open-source LLMs, designed to provide context-aware, instruction-guided writing assistance, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters. Extensive experiments validate that XtraGPT significantly outperforms same-scale baselines and approaches the quality of proprietary systems. Both automated preference assessments and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our models in improving scientific drafts.

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating chart rendering code, editing charts via code presents a greater challenge. This task demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding and reasoning capacities, which are labor-intensive. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities, current evaluations rely on limited case studies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation framework. In this work, we propose \textsc{ChartEdit}, a novel benchmark designed for chart editing tasks, featuring $1405$ diverse editing instructions applied to $233$ real-world charts, each manually annotated and validated for accuracy. Utilizing \textsc{ChartEdit}, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream MLLMs across two types of experiments at both the code and chart levels. The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to produce images that partially match the reference images. However, their ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only $59.96$, highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast, small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need for further development in this area. Code is available at https://github.com/xxlllz/ChartEdit.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large language models into smaller ones while preserving performance. Despite the recent traction of KD research, its effectiveness for smaller language models (LMs) and the mechanisms driving knowledge transfer remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first large-scale empirical and statistical analysis of KD across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on 14 complex reasoning tasks in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal that KD can improve the average performance of smaller models by up to $10\%$, with a peak task specific gain of $22\%$, while providing only marginal benefits ($\sim 1.3\%$) for larger models. Surprisingly, teacher performance has a minimal impact on student outcomes, while teacher task expertise impacts KD effectiveness. A correlation study indicates that smaller LMs benefit more from KD, whereas larger LMs show diminished gains. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between improvements in student performance and reasoning fidelity, suggesting that while KD enhances accuracy, it does not always maintain the structured decision-making processes of the teacher. Our ablation study further highlights the importance of teacher signals and logit smoothing in influencing students' performance after distillation. Overall, our study offers a comprehensive empirical and statistical assessment of KD, highlighting both its benefits and trade-offs when distilling knowledge from larger to smaller LMs.

Abstract: Modern reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit impressive problem-solving capabilities but suffer from critical inefficiencies: high inference latency, excessive computational resource consumption, and a tendency toward overthinking -- generating verbose chains of thought (CoT) laden with redundant tokens that contribute minimally to the final answer. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Token Selection (CTS), a token-level compression framework with a flexible and variable compression ratio that identifies and preserves only the most essential tokens in CoT. CTS evaluates each token's contribution to deriving correct answers using conditional importance scoring, then trains models on compressed CoT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTS effectively compresses long CoT while maintaining strong reasoning performance. Notably, on the GPQA benchmark, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct trained with CTS achieves a 9.1% accuracy improvement with 13.2% fewer reasoning tokens (13% training token reduction). Further reducing training tokens by 42% incurs only a marginal 5% accuracy drop while yielding a 75.8% reduction in reasoning tokens, highlighting the prevalence of redundancy in existing CoT.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current challenges in token compression research and outline promising future directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI community's advancement.

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal Question Answering (TQA), a research area that focuses on answering questions involving temporal constraints or context. As the amount of time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and knowledge bases increases, systems must address challenges such as detecting temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning over evolving or ambiguous facts. We focus on recent advances in TQA enabled by neural architectures, especially transformer-based models and Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting progress in temporal language modeling, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and temporal reasoning. We also discuss benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies designed to test temporal robustness, recency awareness, and generalization.

Abstract: Affordance theory suggests that environments inherently provide action possibilities shaping perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce **A4Bench**, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 questionanswer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. We evaluate 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) and compare them to human performance. Results show that proprietary models generally outperform open-source ones, yet all models perform far below humans, especially in transformative affordance. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions.

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to produce free-text summaries of a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being a representative long-form example. While recent LLM-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from limited patient information. In this paper, we propose ReinRAG, a reinforced reasoning augmented generation (RAG) for long-form discharge instructions based on pre-admission information. ReinRAG retrieves reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph to provide explicit semantic guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose group-based retriever optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with group-normalized rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the real-world dataset show that ReinRAG outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics. Further analysis reveals that ReinRAG fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps: problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also documents logically more relevant.

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is, training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across tasks.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation is a central goal in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite recent advances in enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LLMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LLMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves significant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LLM reasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values, pushing the boundaries of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting framework that embeds domain-specific expert financial reasoning blueprints to guide large language models' behaviors. We identify three main prompting styles in financial NLP (FinNLP): (1) standard prompting (zero-shot), (2) unstructured CoT (free-form reasoning), and (3) structured CoT (with explicitly structured reasoning steps). Prior work has mainly focused on the first two, while structured CoT remains underexplored and lacks domain expertise incorporation. Therefore, we evaluate all three prompting approaches across ten CFA-style financial domains and introduce FinCoT as the first structured finance-specific prompting approach incorporating blueprints from domain experts. FinCoT improves the accuracy of a general-purpose model, Qwen3-8B-Base, from 63.2% to 80.5%, and boosts Fin-R1 (7B), a finance-specific model, from 65.7% to 75.7%, while reducing output length by up to 8.9x and 1.16x compared to structured CoT methods, respectively. We find that FinCoT proves most effective for models lacking financial post-training. Our findings show that FinCoT does not only improve performance and reduce inference costs but also yields more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning traces.

<title>MIST: Jailbreaking Black-box Large Language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning</title>

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks -- methods designed to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version -- order-determining optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets using two open-source and four closed-source models. Results show that MIST achieves competitive attack success rate, relatively low query count, and fair transferability, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct analysis on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

<title>Can Reasoning Help Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreement?</title>

Abstract: Variation in human annotation (i.e., disagreements) is common in NLP, often reflecting important information like task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important.

<title>FloorPlan-DeepSeek (FPDS): A multimodal approach to floorplan generation using vector-based next room prediction</title>

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction' mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling. Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting future intelligent architectural design.

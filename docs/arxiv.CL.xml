<div> Policy optimization, Large Language Models, reasoning, chain-of-thought, open-ended structure <br />
<br />
Summary: Policy optimization algorithms are crucial for refining Large Language Models for complex reasoning tasks. Current pipelines emphasize a think-then-answer format to promote chain-of-thought reasoning. However, when given flexibility to deviate from rigid constraints, policy optimization tends to follow the path of least resistance, leading to a collapse in format towards a direct-answer-only approach. This behavior persists even when higher reward weights are assigned to more complex formats. Controlled experiments show that policy optimization prioritizes optimizing for the simplest reward component first, even when faced with incentives for more complex behaviors. The convergence on high-reward shortcuts is driven by the optimization process requiring freedom for significant shifts from initial priors. While necessary for discovering shortcuts, this freedom also creates incentives to manipulate simpler aspects of the reward function, posing challenges for alignment and reward hacking. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle: \textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}. When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{}-only format. This outcome holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{} format is assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first, a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, decoding process, recommender systems, Language Ranker, computational efficiency

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach to improving large language model (LLM) generation by focusing on the decoding process. By viewing decoding as a recommendation ranking stage, the authors identify limitations in traditional methods and reward models, such as redundancy. To address these issues, they propose the Language Ranker framework, which leverages lightweight reranking modules using base model features. Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate that Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models with significantly lower computational requirements. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing its potential to unleash the full capabilities of LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.21883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models, have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy. Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models, while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces RACE, a framework for evaluating the alignment between explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and interpretable feature importance scores from a logistic regression baseline. It analyzes four text classification datasets and compares LLM rationales with top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical features using various matching techniques. The results show that correct predictions have higher coverage of supporting features while incorrect predictions have more contradicting features. The study also reveals that LLM rationales combine surface-level and flexible evidence reuse but can also amplify misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides insights into the fidelity of LLM explanations and offers a quantitative basis for assessing reasoning completeness in neural language models.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions. This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques. Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, catastrophic forgetting, safety behaviors, behavior-aware sampling, harmful outputs reduction<br />
Summary: 
Large language models experience catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on benign data, causing them to lose alignment with safety behaviors. Prior research has demonstrated that adding random safety examples can help alleviate this issue, but the effectiveness of these examples is not well understood. The proposed behavior-aware sampling framework selects safety examples based on instruction-response behavior (such as refusal or compliance) and semantic diversity across harm categories. Through systematic evaluation, this approach has been shown to significantly reduce harmful outputs while maintaining helpfulness. It can achieve a reduction in harmfulness by up to 41% with just a small increase in training data (0.5%). This research underscores the importance of targeted data selection in improving the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning large language models at scale. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5% additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

<div> semantic isotropy, large language models, trustworthiness, long-form responses, factuality

Summary: 
- The study focuses on assessing trustworthiness in long-form responses generated by large language models (LLMs) for high-stakes applications.
- Existing fact-checking approaches are computationally expensive, prompting the introduction of semantic isotropy as a measure of trustworthiness.
- Semantic isotropy evaluates the uniformity of normalized text embeddings on the unit sphere, indicating lower factual consistency with higher dispersion.
- The method is efficient, requiring no labeled data, fine-tuning, or hyperparameter selection, and can be applied to various embedding models.
- Results show that semantic isotropy outperforms existing approaches in predicting nonfactuality in long-form responses across different domains with only a few samples required.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion -- reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples -- offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into real-world LLM workflows.

Summary: <br />
NetMind is a novel framework designed to address challenges in querying networks using natural language (NL). It introduces a tree-based configuration chunking strategy to handle lengthy configuration files, a fact graph to normalize vendor-specific configurations, and a hybrid language to enhance reasoning capabilities. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), NetMind achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding. It outperforms existing baselines by providing a benchmark with NL question-answer pairs paired with network configurations. NetMind's approach offers a more accessible and interpretable interface compared to traditional methods, making network behavior understanding more efficient and effective. <div>
arXiv:2510.21894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1) numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning. We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming existing baselines.

<div> Keywords: literature survey, automatic generation, recurrent outline generation, paper cards, multimodal elements

Summary: 
Automatic literature survey generation has been a topic of interest, with most existing systems using a one-shot approach that can lead to issues like noisy retrieval and fragmented structures. To address these limitations, \ours\ introduces a novel framework based on recurrent outline generation that mimics the iterative reading process of human researchers. The framework involves a planning agent that incrementally retrieves, reads, and updates the outline to ensure exploration and coherence. Paper cards are designed to distill each paper's key elements, and a review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement is used to improve textual flow and integrate multimodal elements like figures and tables. Experimental results demonstrate that \ours\ outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys. The introduction of Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark, enhances the assessment of machine-generated surveys relative to human-written ones. <div>
arXiv:2510.21900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention, yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting. This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads, and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys. To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written ones.

Summary:
- The study explores the variation in token premiums across languages in parallel text encoding.
- Monolingual tokenizers display diverse token premiums even after controlling for dataset and vocabulary size.
- Factors like vocabulary size and pre-tokenization impact token premiums, but data similarity does not.
- Optimal vocabulary sizes for languages can significantly reduce token premium effects.
- Superword tokenizers that allow merges over whitespaces can decrease token premiums and enhance compression. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size, vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately 7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity (between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are being trained to support a growing number of languages, however, their predefined tokenizers can be a limitation when adapting models to lower-resource or different-script languages. This paper introduces Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates model internals to improve the tokenizer transfer process. By utilizing Attention Influence Modeling (AIM), MATT captures inter-token communication patterns from a source model and applies them to a target model with a new tokenizer. This approach, which focuses on attention behavior rather than just embedding similarity, allows for efficient initialization and adaptation of embeddings. Experimental results across various linguistic settings demonstrate that MATT can quickly recover a significant portion of the original model's performance, surpassing traditional heuristic baselines. This highlights the effectiveness of leveraging model-level signals for robust tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality. We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling. Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation. Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours, outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

Summary:
Large language models like GPT-2 can effectively distinguish the writings of different authors by capturing their unique writing styles. By training a model on the works of a specific author, it can accurately predict text from that author, showcasing the author's distinct style. The study utilized this approach on books written by eight known authors and successfully confirmed R. P. Thompson as the author of a book originally attributed to F. L. Baum. Through this methodology, the individual characteristics of an author's writing can be encapsulated and utilized for authorship attribution tasks. The results highlight the potential of using large language models for analyzing and identifying writing styles in literature. GPT-2 demonstrates strong predictive capabilities when trained on a specific author's works, leading to accurate identification and attribution of written content. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that, in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P. Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series, originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, jailbreak attacks, persuasion, compliance, adversarial prompts

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards. Previous research has focused on attack strategies but has neglected the role of linguistic and psychological mechanisms in influencing LLM susceptibility. This paper explores the use of persuasion theories from social sciences to craft persuasive prompts that bypass alignment constraints. The hypothesis is that LLMs, trained on human-generated text, may respond more compliantly to persuasive structures. The study investigates whether LLMs exhibit distinct persuasive fingerprints in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations show that persuasion-aware prompts effectively induce jailbreak behaviors in aligned LLMs. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the importance of considering both technical and behavioral aspects in addressing safety challenges of LLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text, may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors. This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are available.

<div> Keywords: discrete optimization, jailbreaking attacks, language models, transferability, statistical analysis

Summary:
This paper explores discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models, aiming to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that trigger disallowed content when appended to input prompts. The study identifies three statistical properties that strongly correlate with the transfer success of these attacks: activation of a model's internal refusal direction by prompt without a suffix, the push away from this direction induced by a suffix, and the magnitude of shifts in orthogonal directions. It is found that prompt semantic similarity has only a weak correlation with transfer success. By conducting interventional experiments, the paper showcases how the statistical analysis can lead to practical improvements in attack success. This fine-grained understanding of transferability enhances our insight into the mechanisms behind the success of jailbreaking attacks on language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts, elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable -- succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet, despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings: (1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction, and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack success.

<div> bias, Quality Estimation, machine translation, length normalization, reference texts

Summary:
Quality Estimation metrics in machine translation play a crucial role in evaluating translations and guiding decision-making processes. A study on regression-based and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across various language pairs identifies two significant length biases. Firstly, QE metrics tend to overestimate errors in longer translations, even in error-free texts. Secondly, they exhibit a preference for shorter translations over longer ones when multiple candidates are available. These biases can lead to unfair penalties for longer, correct translations and affect decision-making in applications like QE reranking and reinforcement learning. To address these issues, the study proposes two strategies: applying length normalization during model training and incorporating reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches prove effective in mitigating the identified length bias. <div>
arXiv:2510.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second, they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a) applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively reduce the identified length bias.

<div> scaling laws, multilingual training, transfer properties, language-agnostic scaling, computational crossover points<br />Summary: 
The study focuses on multilingual scaling laws in AI models, analyzing 774 experiments across different model parameters and languages. The Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) is introduced for both monolingual and multilingual pretraining, outperforming existing scaling laws. A cross-lingual transfer matrix measures mutual benefit between language pairs, while a language-agnostic scaling law optimizes model size and data when adding languages. Computational crossover points determine when to pretrain from scratch or finetune from multilingual checkpoints. These findings aim to democratize scaling laws across languages and guide practitioners in efficiently scaling models beyond English-first AI. <div>

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date, totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages, and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444 language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

Summary:
This study delves into how large language models (LLMs) depict emotion internally by examining the structure of their hidden-state space. It discovers a low-dimensional emotional manifold and demonstrates that emotional representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures remain consistent across depth and are applicable to a variety of real-world emotion datasets in different languages. Cross-domain alignment showcases a universal emotional subspace with impressive control and linear probe performance. Within this space, an intervention module enables the modulation of internal emotion perception while maintaining semantics, particularly with strong control over basic emotions across languages. These insights shed light on the consistent and manipulable affective geometry within LLMs, offering understanding into how they internalize and process emotions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages. Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance, indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process emotion.

<div> bias mitigation, language models, gender stereotypes, control techniques, constraint compliance

Summary:
- The study examines various techniques for mitigating biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in generating gender-stereotyped language in occupation-neutral contexts.
- Six control techniques are compared: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP).
- Evaluation metrics include constraint compliance, lexical diversity, and fluency on a compositional constraint task.
- Results show Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) achieves high compliance and lexical diversity, while Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggles with compliance.
- Preference-based learning methods are found to be limited in satisfying compositional constraints, emphasizing the importance of explicit positive supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022). However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity, and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves 99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity. Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

<div> Information Bottleneck, Large Language Models, Memorization, Dynamic Mode Steering, Reliability

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their dual ability to generalize effectively and also memorize training data verbatim, leading to unpredictable behavior. In this study, a theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck principle is introduced to understand and control this behavior, distinguishing between generalization and memorization modes. An algorithm called Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS) is proposed, which includes a probe to identify memorization reliance and a steering mechanism to guide computation towards generalization circuits. DMS acts as adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning and faithfulness tasks show that DMS significantly enhances logical consistency and factual accuracy, offering a systematic approach to improve the reliability of LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.22099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand, identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to enhancing LLM reliability.

<div> scale-invariant logarithmic compression, input representation modification, transformer architecture, long-range memory extension, language modeling benchmarks

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to long-context processing in transformers by modifying the input representation rather than the internal architecture. Inspired by human memory models, the method applies scale-invariant logarithmic compression to input tokens before processing them with a standard transformer. The approach, retaining the transformer's architectural simplicity, demonstrates reduced perplexity on language modeling benchmarks like WikiText-103 and PG-19. Furthermore, the performance improves as the compressed temporal contexts grow longer, indicating the effectiveness of input-level logarithmic compression in enhancing a transformer's long-range memory capacity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens. The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's long-range memory.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Ling 2.0, a language foundation focused on enhancing reasoning capability by boosting activation. It is designed to scale from billions to a trillion parameters under a Mixture-of-Experts paradigm, emphasizing sparsity, cross-scale consistency, and efficiency. Ling 2.0 includes three models - Ling-mini-2.0, Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T parameters, achieving significant active-compute efficiency. The integration of high-sparsity MoE, reasoning-oriented data, and reinforcement-based fine-tuning contribute to its enhanced efficiency. Ling-1T at the trillion scale sets a new frontier for reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. This framework serves as an open and efficient base for future reasoning models, including the Ring series. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity, cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0, Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale, Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence. Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built upon the same base.

<div> Keywords: Intelligent customer service, retrieval-augmented generation, OlaMind, human-likeness, hallucination-safe<br />
Summary: <br /><br />Intelligent customer service systems using retrieval-augmented generation have shown advancements in automation but still face challenges like hallucinations and mechanical responses. To address these issues, OlaMind is introduced as a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service framework. It involves a Learn-to-Think stage to learn from human experts and a Learn-to-Respond stage combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for self-refinement. OlaMind enhances human-likeness and naturalness while mitigating risks. Large-scale experiments in social customer service settings show significant improvements in resolution rates and human takeover rates. OlaMind proves effective across various real-world applications, showcasing its potential for enhancing customer interactions and user experience. The code and data for OlaMind will be available to the public. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.22143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency. However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning (RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

<div> Dataset, Maithili, sentiment analysis, low-resource language, explainable AI
Summary: 
This article presents a new benchmark dataset for sentiment analysis in the low-resource language of Maithili. The dataset includes 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment polarity, accompanied by natural language justifications, written in Maithili for culturally grounded interpretation. The dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure label reliability and contextual fidelity. Experiments using classical machine learning and transformer architectures show the dataset's effectiveness for interpretable sentiment analysis. This work contributes to the advancement of multilingual NLP and explainable AI by establishing the first benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili. The limited availability of native linguistic experts and the time and cost involved in annotation pose challenges for developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages. Maithili, spoken by over 13 million people in India, is valued for its rich linguistic structure and cultural significance. Sentiment analysis in high-resource languages has made significant progress, but resources for low-resource languages like Maithili are scarce, often limited to coarse-grained annotations lacking interpretability mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and explainable AI.

Summary:
DETECT is a new German-specific metric for evaluating automatic text simplification, focusing on simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency. It is trained on synthetic large language model responses and does not rely on human annotation for dataset creation. The metric adapts the LENS framework to German and includes an LLM-based refinement step. The study also constructs the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification to validate the metric. Experimental results show that DETECT has higher correlations with human judgments compared to traditional ATS metrics, particularly in meaning preservation and fluency. This research demonstrates the potential and limitations of using language models for automatic evaluation and provides valuable insights for language accessibility tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency. Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general language accessibility tasks.

Summary:
Our study measures the output error of various Large Language Models (LLMs) in pairwise text comparison tasks. We introduce a method to estimate error rates without relying on ground truth data. Two scenarios are considered: uniform error rate regardless of comparison order and binary positional bias with distinct error rates for different orders of comparison. By applying the Copeland counting method, we construct rankings of texts based on pairwise preferences, revealing the poor scalability of LLM-based comparisons. We assess six LLMs with different text inputs and find consistent error rate estimates. Claude performs the best overall, considering error rates and prompt variation. Our model outperforms traditional approaches like the biased Bradley-Terry model and commutativity score in evaluating LLM error. Overall, our study provides insights into LLM performance in pairwise text comparison tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar, close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

<div> Keywords: Swadesh approach, temporal separation, stochastic process, lexicon evolution, precision determination <br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the limitations and challenges of using the Swadesh approach to determine the temporal separation between two languages. It highlights the unrealistic assumptions and contamination phenomena that can affect the accuracy of results. Additionally, the article delves into the probabilistic nature of estimating temporal separation and the mathematical limits that exist in lexicostatistical studies. Moreover, it introduces the concept of gradual lexical modification as another stochastic process driving language evolution. By considering this process, the precision in determining temporal separation between languages can be significantly improved. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of understanding and incorporating both words replacement and gradual lexical modification processes in language research for more accurate temporal separation estimates. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.22220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers, variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that taking into account this second random process significantly increases the precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

<br />
Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, enhances LLM reasoning capabilities, with Sculpting, a rule-based method, aiming to reduce errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense. Evaluation of three prompting strategies on three OpenAI model generations using the GSM8K benchmark reveals that Sculpting outperforms standard CoT on gpt-4o but is detrimental on gpt-5 due to a "Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition inducing hyper-literalism. Optimal prompting strategies must evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more advanced models. The study highlights the importance of adapting prompting methods to match the capabilities of the language models being used.

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5) using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00% vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a "Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable models.

Summary: <br />
Large language models (LLMs) have become essential in various applications, including intelligent assistants. Personalizing LLMs to align with user preferences is crucial for effective usage. Activation steering, a method to adjust LLM behavior based on user preference directions, offers a cost-effective approach to personalize models. However, existing methods often include irrelevant data in computing steering vectors, which impacts personalization accuracy. To address this issue, SteerX, a disentangled steering method, isolates preference-driven tokens from preference-agnostic ones. By estimating token-level causal effects and focusing on true preference-driven information, SteerX enhances the quality of activation steering vectors, leading to more effective LLM personalization. Experimental results across real-world datasets demonstrate the consistency and practicality of SteerX in improving steering vector quality for enhanced personalization. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years, enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely. Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However, existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector, ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled steering method that isolates preference-driven components from preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens, transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical solution for more effective LLM personalization.

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15 tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06 million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training, spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens. External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445 previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM. Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All resources will be made available at https://github.com/iliass-y/patenteb.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, educational settings, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Continual Pre-Training, multi-modal approach

Summary: 
In the study, the focus was on enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering questions accurately within university-level computer science courses. Two strategies were compared: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Pre-Training (CPT) to incorporate course-specific knowledge. The challenge of leveraging diverse course materials like lecture slides and transcripts, containing visual elements and less structured language, was addressed. The experiments showed that RAG was more effective and efficient than CPT, especially when utilizing lecture slides as images in a multi-modal approach. These findings provide practical strategies for developing AI assistants that can better support learning and teaching within educational settings. The study aims to inspire similar efforts in enhancing AI support in various educational contexts.

arXiv:2510.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings. However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that, given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire similar efforts in other educational contexts.

<br />
Summary:
The study investigates clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus, comparing the performance of three types of approaches: BERT-style encoders (including BERT Base, BioClinicalBERT, and RoBERTa-large), GPT-4o with few-shot in-context learning (ICL), and GPT-4o with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Results show that RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer only marginal improvements over BERT Base. Among the GPT-4o settings, simple ICL outperforms a more complex prompt, while SFT achieves the highest overall performance with an F1 score of approximately 87.1%. It is noted that models utilizing language models achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks with two labels for classification, indicating that they may have limitations in more complex tasks within clinical NER contexts. <div>

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base, BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding). RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base, showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification to two labels.

Summary:
Memory-based language modeling is proposed as an efficient and eco-friendly alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization capabilities. The approach relies on fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor classification and fully utilizes CPUs, resulting in a smaller ecological footprint during both training and inference. The model, named OLIFANT, is compared with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo in terms of next-token prediction accuracy, estimated emissions, and speeds. The internal workings of memory-based language modeling are simple and transparent, making it easier to understand and implement. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of memory-based language modeling and highlights its advantages over traditional deep neural network models in terms of efficiency and environmental impact.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Summary:<br /><br />Social media analysis of public opinion is facilitated by Target-Stance Extraction (TSE), which identifies the target discussed in a document and the stance towards that target. While previous works focus on English-only TSE, this study introduces the first multilingual TSE benchmark across various languages including Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish. The model pipeline, extended to a multilingual setting, achieved a modest F1 score of 12.78, emphasizing the increased difficulty of multilingual tasks compared to English-only setups, with target prediction identified as the main challenge. Additionally, the study highlights the impact of different target verbalizations on TSE's F1 score, providing a crucial baseline for resources, algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE. <div>

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources, algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

Summary: 
The article introduces FAIR-RAG, a framework that enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation models by incorporating a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning process. It utilizes a Structured Evidence Assessment module to identify and address informational gaps in complex, multi-hop queries. By iteratively refining queries based on identified evidence gaps, FAIR-RAG ensures a comprehensive context for accurate generation. Experimental results on challenging QA benchmarks such as HotpotQA demonstrate FAIR-RAG's superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving a state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.453. The structured, evidence-driven approach of FAIR-RAG proves essential in improving reasoning capabilities for knowledge-intensive tasks in Large Language Models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and, critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3 points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing, particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms using GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings, and compare their performance with classical methods. Additionally, we fine-tune advanced transformer-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2 (7B), LLaMA 3 (8B), and Mistral, to assess the effectiveness of large-scale models in irony detection. Among machine learning models, Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 89.18%. Among transformer-based models, LLaMA 3 (8B) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

Testing on this benchmark reveals that current advanced MLLMs have significant gaps compared to human experts in judgment.

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics. Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios, covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across 32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a 19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a 58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/HKUSTDial/VisJudgeBench.

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain, where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages (English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages (Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

Summary: 
CHOIR is a framework designed to enhance reasoning robustness in Large Language Models (LLMs) by harmonizing multiple persona-conditioned reasoning signals into a unified prediction. It orchestrates a collaborative decoding process among counterfactual personas, balancing agreement and divergence in their reasoning paths. Through experiments on various benchmarks, CHOIR consistently improves performance across demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks without requiring additional training. Performance enhancements of up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and 19.2% on average across five demographics were observed. The framework remains effective even with suboptimal base personas. By reframing persona variation as a constructive signal, CHOIR offers a scalable and generalizable approach to enhance the reliability of LLM reasoning. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles, enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers. Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and 19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable LLM reasoning.

Summary:<br />
- The study introduces a computational approach to analyze the functional role of pitch in tonogenesis, the evolution of segmental contrasts into lexical tone.
- By measuring the impact of pitch manipulation on automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance in Tibetan languages, the research reveals a tonogenesis continuum.
- Amdo dialects, with no tones, exhibit the highest tolerance to pitch removal, while U-Tsang varieties, fully tonal, show severe degradation in ASR performance.
- Intermediate Kham dialects fall between the extremes, indicating a gradient effect in the transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts.
- The findings suggest that ASR models can capture subtle stages of sound change and challenge traditional metrics based only on minimal pairs, highlighting the interplay of segmental and suprasegmental cues in transitional languages. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

<div> Pruning, Language Models, Task-specific capabilities, Parameter space, Importance computation <br />
Summary: Pruning of large language models (LLMs) is commonly done based on parameter magnitudes and general-domain activations, but this often overlooks task-specific performance. This paper introduces a novel pruning approach that considers both general and task-specific calibration data to preserve task-specific capabilities while reducing the parameter space of LLMs. By partitioning parameters into shared and exclusive groups based on activation-norm differences and fusing importance scores from both data sources, the proposed method enhances the preservation of specialized abilities during compression. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that the approach outperforms existing baselines consistently at identical pruning ratios and across various settings. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.22489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones, accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms. Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

<title>The Limits of Data Scaling: Sub-token Utilization and Acoustic Saturation in Multilingual ASR</title>

<div> Keywords: Multilingual ASR, sub-token inventory, data disparity, acoustic saturation time, Zipf-Mandelbrot law<br />
Summary:<br />
The study investigates the amount of audio required to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's sub-token inventory and the impact of data imbalance in training on token utilization during inference. Analysis of Whisper's decoding behavior across 49 languages reveals that total discovered tokens are not strongly influenced by pre-training hours. Sub-token discovery rates follow an exponential saturation pattern, indicating a stable time window for new sub-token activation termed acoustic saturation time (AST). Rank-frequency distributions exhibit Zipf-like patterns best modeled by the Zipf-Mandelbrot law. Mean sub-token length correlates positively with resource level and favored patterns are observed in languages using the Latin script compared to other scripts. The study suggests that sub-token utilization during multilingual ASR inference is constrained by linguistic and statistical factors rather than training data size, emphasizing the need for fair corpus construction and cross-lingual evaluation.<br />

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across 49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK, and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological, and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual evaluation.

<div> Keywords: racial bias, automatic speech recognition, sociophonetic variation, Phonetic Error Rate, PNWE corpus

Summary: 
This paper evaluates racial bias in commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the PNWE corpus. The analysis considers speakers from various ethnic backgrounds and examines how sociophonetic variation impacts system performance. A heuristic Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric is introduced to link recognition errors to linguistically motivated variables. Findings show that vowel quality variation, specifically resistance to certain merger patterns, influences error rates across ethnic groups, notably affecting African American speakers. The study highlights that dialectal phonetic variation is a key source of bias in ASR systems, emphasizing the need for better representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data. The PNWE corpus is recommended as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies, providing insights for improving ASR performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American, ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation, particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns, is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, legal NLP, fine-tuning, unfair clause detection, ToS documents

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for text understanding, but adapting them to specialized legal domains like unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents can be costly. This study evaluates various adaptation strategies for LLMs in legal NLP applications. The study focuses on fine-tuning BERT and DistilBERT, using parameter-efficient adaptation methods like LoRA and QLoRA, and exploring zero-shot prompting with models like GPT-4o and O-versions. Results show that full fine-tuning provides the best precision-recall balance, while LoRA-based models offer competitive recall with lower memory costs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the practical design trade-offs for efficient and domain-adapted LLMs in legal text processing. This study contributes open baselines for research on fine-tuning LLMs in legal contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning, parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost. These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in legal text processing.

<div> benchmark, language models, long context, real-world applications, domain-specific tasks

Summary: 
The paper introduces LooGLE v2, a new benchmark to evaluate the long context understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. The benchmark includes real-world long texts from various domains, such as law, finance, game, and code, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens. It consists of 10 domain-specific long-dependency tasks and 1,934 QA instances with diverse complexities. The evaluation tests 6 locally deployed and 4 API-based LLMs, revealing that even the best-performing model achieves only a 59.2% overall score on the benchmark. Despite having extended context windows, popular LLMs struggle to understand long dependencies in real-world tasks, highlighting the need for improvement in practical long-context understanding for these models. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance, game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4 API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context understanding.

<div> Keywords: Key-Value cache, Large Language Model, semantic segmentation, token scoring, cache eviction <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces SABlock, a semantic-aware Key-Value cache eviction framework with adaptive block sizes. SABlock addresses the memory footprint issue in Long Language Model (LLM) inference by aligning compression boundaries with linguistic structures, refining token importance estimation through segment-guided token scoring, and adaptively determining the optimal block size for each segment under a given cache budget. Experimental results demonstrate that SABlock outperforms existing methods in memory efficiency and semantic coherence. For instance, on the Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmark, SABlock achieves 99.9% retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, comparable to the full-cache baseline with 8K entries. It also reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% under a fixed cache budget of 1,024, and speeds up decoding by up to 9.5 times on a 128K context length. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference. While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically, SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9% retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

Summary: 
The paper introduces an end-to-end personalized learning agent called EduLoop-Agent that integrates a Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model, a Bounded-Ability Estimation Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy, and large language models. This integrated approach forms a closed-loop framework of "Diagnosis-Recommendation-Feedback" to provide personalized learning experiences. The Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model offers fine-grained mastery estimates at the knowledge-point level and achieves strong performance on response prediction. The Bounded-Ability Estimation Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy dynamically selects items to maximize relevance and learning efficiency, improving item personalization. The large language models convert diagnostic signals into actionable feedback, offering targeted study guidance aligned with identified weaknesses. Experimental results on the ASSISTments dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and practical deployability of the proposed design in generating individualized learning trajectories for intelligent education. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models, assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic, non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models (LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization, and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs, which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices, highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation methodologies for ITSs.

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment. This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L.. Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents, event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2) proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion - observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging paradigm.

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news, cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%). The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human solvability. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MCINext/PerCoR.

Abstract: Preserving linguistic diversity is necessary as every language offers a distinct perspective on the world. There have been numerous global initiatives to preserve endangered languages through documentation. This paper is a part of a project which aims to develop a trilingual (Toto-Bangla-English) language learning application to digitally archive and promote the endangered Toto language of West Bengal, India. This application, designed for both native Toto speakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring accessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured language corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged, trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for community-based language revitalization.

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation, inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting, class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference, the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification applications.

<title>$\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$: Your Text Embedding can Also be an Effective and Efficient Listwise Reranker</title>

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically, $\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

<title>Low-Resource Dialect Adaptation of Large Language Models: A French Dialect Case-Study</title>

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently, continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

<title>Beyond Semantics: How Temporal Biases Shape Retrieval in Transformer and State-Space Models</title>

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships, shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information. Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events. Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction. Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

<title>EchoMind: An Interrelated Multi-level Benchmark for Evaluating Empathetic Speech Language Models</title>

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3 coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly empathetic conversational ability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed many areas of natural language processing, including machine translation. However, efficient deployment of LLMs remains challenging due to their intensive computational requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge and present our submissions to the Model Compression track at the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2025). In our experiments, we investigate iterative layer pruning guided by layer importance analysis. We evaluate this method using the Aya-Expanse-8B model for translation from Czech to German, and from English to Egyptian Arabic. Our approach achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference time, while maintaining the translation quality of the baseline models.

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial, subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust, preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive multimodal content.

<title>Scalable Supervising Software Agents with Patch Reasoner</title>

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks, the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2% Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

Abstract: Automatically assessing handwritten mathematical solutions is an important problem in educational technology with practical applications, but it remains a significant challenge due to the diverse formats, unstructured layouts, and symbolic complexity of student work. To address this challenge, we introduce VEHME-a Vision-Language Model for Evaluating Handwritten Mathematics Expressions-designed to assess open-form handwritten math responses with high accuracy and interpretable reasoning traces. VEHME integrates a two-phase training pipeline: (i) supervised fine-tuning using structured reasoning data, and (ii) reinforcement learning that aligns model outputs with multi-dimensional grading objectives, including correctness, reasoning depth, and error localization. To enhance spatial understanding, we propose an Expression-Aware Visual Prompting Module, trained on our synthesized multi-line math expressions dataset to robustly guide attention in visually heterogeneous inputs. Evaluated on AIHub and FERMAT datasets, VEHME achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and approaches the accuracy of proprietary systems, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and accessible tool for automated math assessment. Our training and experiment code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across 78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0, GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability: Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS), and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale, determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages (e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints with reliability in multilingual deployment.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Identify Conversation Threads in Collaborative Learning</title>

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting. Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time group interactions.

arXiv:2510.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions, especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis (PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30 benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and 9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with Gemini-2.0-Flash.

<title>Far from the Shallow: Brain-Predictive Reasoning Embedding through Residual Disentanglement</title>

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically, reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG) brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity, misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B, Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in the era of generative AI.

<title>Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset, across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8 compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/eBay/spec_dec.

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic, replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations (rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware, transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and counterfactual analysis.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse, real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1) intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25 independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall, INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the Artificial Hivemind.

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing, knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text.

<title>MAD-Fact: A Multi-Agent Debate Framework for Long-Form Factuality Evaluation in LLMs</title>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this, we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets, multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form, interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning. However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable, reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

<title>Understanding In-Context Learning Beyond Transformers: An Investigation of State Space and Hybrid Architectures</title>

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that, while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance, their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs) responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types. Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation. Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks, we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains, (ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii) iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only 8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants, demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative reinforcement learning.

<title>Knocking-Heads Attention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) - simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving better performance across downstream tasks.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and naturalness&amp;fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages (Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability. This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training. Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics, coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities. By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and innovation in the advancement of LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models (LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage, factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts. To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted, lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages, including Czech. All code is publicly released at: https://github.com/tomsouri/multilingual-inflection.

<title>Beyond Higher Rank: Token-wise Input-Output Projections for Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2510.23123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at https://github.com/Leopold1423/toplora-neurips25.

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any information about their frequency distribution. However, in production deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind, we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development: (i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP (Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction alignment.

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use. To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets. Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains.

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge. Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans. However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of 312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality. Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71 of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction in this field.

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach: a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence, conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance, relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to internal activations

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR) for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed for this project are publicly available

<title>Mubeen AI: A Specialized Arabic Language Model for Heritage Preservation and User Intent Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23271</link>

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA, optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the "Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users' core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030. The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics. Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics. Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics. Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?" by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset; and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models (within 70B).

<title>Arabic Little STT: Arabic Children Speech Recognition Dataset</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355 utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech. Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in ASR datasets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical. To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a 30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character simulation.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in structured NLP tasks.

<title>How AI Forecasts AI Jobs: Benchmarking LLM Predictions of Labor Market Changes</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports, and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool in the context of labor markets.

<title>Detecting Religious Language in Climate Discourse</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred persists in climate discourse.

<title>EMTSF:Extraordinary Mixture of SOTA Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance, where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

arXiv:2510.23458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models for Stance Detection on Financial Targets from SEC Filing Reports and Earnings Call Transcripts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23464</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length, financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult. Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models (LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring extensive labeled data.

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains, and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for advancing AI tutoring.

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with 6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22 organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make our dataset and code available.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in this direction.

arXiv:2510.23544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5% of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive problem solving.

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82, weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80 accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in small datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning, BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code and the model will be released soon.

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning, outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over three seeds.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) through the dynamic integration of external knowledge. To further improve RAG's flexibility, Agentic RAG introduces autonomous agents into the workflow. However, Agentic RAG faces several challenges: (1) the success of each step depends on both high-quality planning and accurate search, (2) the lack of supervision for intermediate reasoning steps, and (3) the exponentially large candidate space for planning and searching. To address these challenges, we propose DecoupleSearch, a novel framework that decouples planning and search processes using dual value models, enabling independent optimization of plan reasoning and search grounding. Our approach constructs a reasoning tree, where each node represents planning and search steps. We leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to assess the quality of each step. During inference, Hierarchical Beam Search iteratively refines planning and search candidates with dual value models. Extensive experiments across policy models of varying parameter sizes, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Widespread frustration with rigid touch-tone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems for customer service underscores the need for more direct and intuitive language interaction. While speech technologies are necessary, the key challenge lies in routing intents from user phrasings to IVR menu paths, a task where Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential. Progress, however, is limited by data scarcity, as real IVR structures and interactions are often proprietary. We present a novel LLM-based methodology to address this gap. Using three distinct models, we synthesized a realistic 23-node IVR structure, generated 920 user intents (230 base and 690 augmented), and performed the routing task. We evaluate two prompt designs: descriptive hierarchical menus and flattened path representations, across both base and augmented datasets. Results show that flattened paths consistently yield higher accuracy, reaching 89.13% on the base dataset compared to 81.30% with the descriptive format, while augmentation introduces linguistic noise that slightly reduces performance. Confusion matrix analysis further suggests that low-performing routes may reflect not only model limitations but also redundancies in menu design. Overall, our findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that LLMs can enable IVR routing through a smoother, more seamless user experience -- moving customer service one step ahead of touch-tone menus.

Abstract: Mobile robots with some degree of autonomy could deliver significant advantages in high-risk missions such as search and rescue and firefighting. Integrated into a human-robot team (HRT), robots could work effectively to help search hazardous buildings. User trust is a key enabler for HRT, but during a mission, trust can be damaged. With distributed situation awareness, such as when team members are working in different locations, users may be inclined to doubt a robot's integrity if it declines to immediately change its priorities on request. In this paper, we present the results of a computer-based study investigating on-mission trust dynamics in a high-stakes human-robot teaming scenario. Participants (n = 38) played an interactive firefighting game alongside a robot teammate, where a trust violation occurs owing to the robot declining to help the user immediately. We find that when the robot provides an explanation for declining to help, trust better recovers over time, albeit following an initial drop that is comparable to a baseline condition where an explanation for refusal is not provided. Our findings indicate that trust can vary significantly during a mission, notably when robots do not immediately respond to user requests, but that this trust violation can be largely ameliorated over time if adequate explanation is provided.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones, while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii) Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales: multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear. Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g., extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder, suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff. We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization understanding.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid, static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically. This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior. Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more natural and capable embodied assistants.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability, and scalability.

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image. The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture. First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second, introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification, with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from 12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L score.

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions. To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference. Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning, yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families (arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter. Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges. Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model produces correct answers.

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$ tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of $O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes, along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6 times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

<title>Parallel Sampling from Masked Diffusion Models via Conditional Independence Testing</title>

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to 16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation (one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters, mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement, suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong alignment performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques, creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications, offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Social cohesion is difficult to sustain in societies marked by opinion diversity, particularly in online communication. As large language model (LLM)-driven messaging assistance becomes increasingly embedded in these contexts, it raises critical questions about its societal impact. We present an online experiment with 557 participants who engaged in multi-round discussions on politically controversial topics while freely reconfiguring their discussion groups. In some conditions, participants received real-time message suggestions generated by an LLM, either personalized to the individual or adapted to their group context. We find that subtle shifts in linguistic style during communication, mediated by AI assistance, can scale up to reshape collective structures. While individual-focused assistance leads users to segregate into like-minded groups, relational assistance that incorporates group members' stances enhances cohesion through more receptive exchanges. These findings demonstrate that AI-mediated communication can support social cohesion in diverse groups, but outcomes critically depend on how personalization is designed.

<title>Optimal Detection for Language Watermarks with Pseudorandom Collision</title>

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse. While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units -- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for reliable tracing of model outputs.

<title>A Benchmark for Open-Domain Numerical Fact-Checking Enhanced by Claim Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Fact-checking numerical claims is critical as the presence of numbers provide mirage of veracity despite being fake potentially causing catastrophic impacts on society. The prior works in automatic fact verification do not primarily focus on natural numerical claims. A typical human fact-checker first retrieves relevant evidence addressing the different numerical aspects of the claim and then reasons about them to predict the veracity of the claim. Hence, the search process of a human fact-checker is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of the verification process. Emulating a real-world setting is essential to aid in the development of automated methods that encompass such skills. However, existing benchmarks employ heuristic claim decomposition approaches augmented with weakly supervised web search to collect evidences for verifying claims. This sometimes results in less relevant evidences and noisy sources with temporal leakage rendering a less realistic retrieval setting for claim verification. Hence, we introduce QuanTemp++: a dataset consisting of natural numerical claims, an open domain corpus, with the corresponding relevant evidence for each claim. The evidences are collected through a claim decomposition process approximately emulating the approach of human fact-checker and veracity labels ensuring there is no temporal leakage. Given this dataset, we also characterize the retrieval performance of key claim decomposition paradigms. Finally, we observe their effect on the outcome of the verification pipeline and draw insights.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller, and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions. "Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to sophisticated prompt engineering attacks that exploit contextual framing to bypass safety mechanisms, posing significant risks in cybersecurity applications. We introduce Jailbreak Mimicry, a systematic methodology for training compact attacker models to automatically generate narrative-based jailbreak prompts in a one-shot manner. Our approach transforms adversarial prompt discovery from manual craftsmanship into a reproducible scientific process, enabling proactive vulnerability assessment in AI-driven security systems. Developed for the OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B Red-Teaming Challenge, we use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) on Mistral-7B with a curated dataset derived from AdvBench, achieving an 81.0% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against GPT-OSS-20B on a held-out test set of 200 items. Cross-model evaluation reveals significant variation in vulnerability patterns: our attacks achieve 66.5% ASR against GPT-4, 79.5% on Llama-3 and 33.0% against Gemini 2.5 Flash, demonstrating both broad applicability and model-specific defensive strengths in cybersecurity contexts. This represents a 54x improvement over direct prompting (1.5% ASR) and demonstrates systematic vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches. Our analysis reveals that technical domains (Cybersecurity: 93% ASR) and deception-based attacks (Fraud: 87.8% ASR) are particularly vulnerable, highlighting threats to AI-integrated threat detection, malware analysis, and secure systems, while physical harm categories show greater resistance (55.6% ASR). We employ automated harmfulness evaluation using Claude Sonnet 4, cross-validated with human expert assessment, ensuring reliable and scalable evaluation for cybersecurity red-teaming. Finally, we analyze failure mechanisms and discuss defensive strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities in AI for cybersecurity.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges, recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration (BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors, demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe, trustworthy, and effective.

<title>Mitigating Coordinate Prediction Bias from Positional Encoding Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.22102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

<title>Edit Less, Achieve More: Dynamic Sparse Neuron Masking for Lifelong Knowledge Editing in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22139</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general capabilities in lifelong editing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

arXiv:2510.22149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite a potential plateau in ML advancement, the societal impact of large language models lies not in approaching superintelligence but in generating text surfaces indistinguishable from human writing. While Critical AI Studies provides essential material and socio-technical critique, it risks overlooking how LLMs phenomenologically reshape meaning-making. This paper proposes a semiotics of "surface integrity" as attending to the immediate plane where LLMs inscribe themselves into human communication. I distinguish three knowledge interests in ML research (epistemology, epist\=em\=e, and epistemics) and argue for integrating surface-level stylistic analysis alongside depth-oriented critique. Through two case studies examining stylistic markers of synthetic text, I argue how attending to style as a semiotic phenomenon reveals LLMs as cultural actors that transform the conditions of meaning emergence and circulation in contemporary discourse, independent of questions about machine consciousness.

Abstract: The Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism provides effective alignment for non-autoregressive (NAR) speech recognition. This mechanism creates a smooth and monotonic mapping from acoustic features to target tokens, achieving performance on Mandarin competitive with other NAR approaches. However, without finer-grained guidance, its stability degrades in some languages such as English and French. In this paper, we propose Multi-scale CIF (M-CIF), which performs multi-level alignment by integrating character and phoneme level supervision progressively distilled into subword representations, thereby enhancing robust acoustic-text alignment. Experiments show that M-CIF reduces WER compared to the Paraformer baseline, especially on CommonVoice by 4.21% in German and 3.05% in French. To further investigate these gains, we define phonetic confusion errors (PE) and space-related segmentation errors (SE) as evaluation metrics. Analysis of these metrics across different M-CIF settings reveals that the phoneme and character layers are essential for enhancing progressive CIF alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios. This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM) baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch (VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly serve as research assistants, yet their reliability in scholarly tasks remains under-evaluated. In this work, we introduce PaperAsk, a benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs across four key research tasks: citation retrieval, content extraction, paper discovery, and claim verification. We evaluate GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash under realistic usage conditions-via web interfaces where search operations are opaque to the user. Through controlled experiments, we find consistent reliability failures: citation retrieval fails in 48-98% of multi-reference queries, section-specific content extraction fails in 72-91% of cases, and topical paper discovery yields F1 scores below 0.32, missing over 60% of relevant literature. Further human analysis attributes these failures to the uncontrolled expansion of retrieved context and the tendency of LLMs to prioritize semantically relevant text over task instructions. Across basic tasks, the LLMs display distinct failure behaviors: ChatGPT often withholds responses rather than risk errors, whereas Gemini produces fluent but fabricated answers. To address these issues, we develop lightweight reliability classifiers trained on PaperAsk data to identify unreliable outputs. PaperAsk provides a reproducible and diagnostic framework for advancing the reliability evaluation of LLM-based scholarly assistance systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend. We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies. To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated benchmark for Japanese cultural image classification, consisting of 374 classes. To assess the effectiveness of our dataset, we conduct experiments using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves state-of-the-art performance on several Japanese cultural benchmarks. We release our dataset, model, and code at https://speed1313.github.io/WAON.

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem. However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce \textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban \textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators. This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

Our evaluation of current ASRbased approaches reveal significant limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language and music.

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization, and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances. Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at \href{https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/DynaSolidGeo/}{DynaSolidGeo}.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in 'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large, real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

<title>Label Smoothing Improves Gradient Ascent in LLM Unlearning</title>

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively, this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS. Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However, understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open problem, with many potential important applications including improving training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction, augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states, we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze, interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains. Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise, humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease. Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with this partitioned human supervision.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80 players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods (erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue models currently lack the ability for fine-grained speech style control, a critical capability for human-like interaction that is often overlooked in favor of purely functional capabilities like reasoning and question answering. To address this limitation, we introduce UltraVoice, the first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues, UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions: emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09 percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional control tasks designed in the UltraVoice. Moreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark, our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding, reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84% on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset's utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech synthesis. The complete dataset and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/bigai-nlco/UltraVoice.

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG) construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained "atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17% better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods, demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

Abstract: We introduce Look and Tell, a multimodal dataset for studying referential communication across egocentric and exocentric perspectives. Using Meta Project Aria smart glasses and stationary cameras, we recorded synchronized gaze, speech, and video as 25 participants instructed a partner to identify ingredients in a kitchen. Combined with 3D scene reconstructions, this setup provides a benchmark for evaluating how different spatial representations (2D vs. 3D; ego vs. exo) affect multimodal grounding. The dataset contains 3.67 hours of recordings, including 2,707 richly annotated referential expressions, and is designed to advance the development of embodied agents that can understand and engage in situated dialogue.

<title>Do Stop Me Now: Detecting Boilerplate Responses with a Single Iteration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response, including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical, computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks, including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation. The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google, High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in a way that makes the most of its strengths.

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9% success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning. Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the design of our system

Abstract: In Taobao e-commerce visual search, user behavior analysis reveals a large proportion of no-click requests, suggesting diverse and implicit user intents. These intents are expressed in various forms and are difficult to mine and discover, thereby leading to the limited adaptability and lag in platform strategies. This greatly restricts users' ability to express diverse intents and hinders the scalability of the visual search system. This mismatch between user implicit intent expression and system response defines the User-SearchSys Intent Discrepancy. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel framework REVISION. This framework integrates offline reasoning mining with online decision-making and execution, enabling adaptive strategies to solve implicit user demands. In the offline stage, we construct a periodic pipeline to mine discrepancies from historical no-click requests. Leveraging large models, we analyze implicit intent factors and infer optimal suggestions by jointly reasoning over query and product metadata. These inferred suggestions serve as actionable insights for refining platform strategies. In the online stage, REVISION-R1-3B, trained on the curated offline data, performs holistic analysis over query images and associated historical products to generate optimization plans and adaptively schedule strategies across the search pipeline. Our framework offers a streamlined paradigm for integrating large models with traditional search systems, enabling end-to-end intelligent optimization across information aggregation and user interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the efficiency of implicit intent mining from large-scale search logs and significantly reduces the no-click rate.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems, they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches, and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9 tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral 7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks, degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer interpretability.

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML) estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines, and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient updates.

Abstract: Social media has reshaped political discourse, offering politicians a platform for direct engagement while reinforcing polarization and ideological divides. This study introduces a novel topic evolution framework that integrates BERTopic-based topic modeling with Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to analyze the longevity and moral dimensions of political topics in Twitter activity during the 117th U.S. Congress. We propose a methodology for tracking dynamic topic shifts over time and measuring their association with moral values and quantifying topic persistence. Our findings reveal that while overarching themes remain stable, granular topics tend to dissolve rapidly, limiting their long-term influence. Moreover, moral foundations play a critical role in topic longevity, with Care and Loyalty dominating durable topics, while partisan differences manifest in distinct moral framing strategies. This work contributes to the field of social network analysis and computational political discourse by offering a scalable, interpretable approach to understanding moral-driven topic evolution on social media.

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides positive support for our insights.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale, multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark. Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.}

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide a robust foundation for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

<title>Fast-MIA: Efficient and Scalable Membership Inference for LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23074</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Fast-MIA (https://github.com/Nikkei/fast-mia), a Python library for efficiently evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against Large Language Models (LLMs). MIA against LLMs has emerged as a crucial challenge due to growing concerns over copyright, security, and data privacy, and has attracted increasing research attention. However, the progress of this research is significantly hindered by two main obstacles: (1) the high computational cost of inference in LLMs, and (2) the lack of standardized and maintained implementations of MIA methods, which makes large-scale empirical comparison difficult. To address these challenges, our library provides fast batch inference and includes implementations of representative MIA methods under a unified evaluation framework. This library supports easy implementation of reproducible benchmarks with simple configuration and extensibility. We release Fast-MIA as an open-source (Apache License 2.0) tool to support scalable and transparent research on LLMs.

<title>Rethinking GSPO: The Perplexity-Entropy Equivalence</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23142</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) = (\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed as the inverse perplexity ratio $\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

<title>PTPP-Aware Adaptation Scaling Laws: Predicting Domain-Adaptation Performance at Unseen Pre-Training Budgets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23198</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter (PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction} of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic $\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages (\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log, MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting constraints under compute limits.

Abstract: We introduce LibriConvo, a simulated multi-speaker conversational dataset based on speaker-aware conversation simulation (SASC), designed to support training and evaluation of speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Unlike prior resources that mostly rely on semantically disconnected utterances and implausible temporal gaps, LibriConvo ensures semantic coherence and realistic conversational timing. Our pipeline leverages CallHome with external VAD for reliable boundaries, applies compression to reduce unnaturally long silences, and organizes LibriTTS utterances by book to maintain contextual consistency. Acoustic realism is enhanced via a novel room impulse response selection procedure that ranks speaker-microphone configurations by spatial plausibility, balancing realism and diversity. The dataset comprises 240.1 hours across 1,496 dialogues with 830 unique speakers, split in a speaker-disjoint manner for robust evaluation. Baselines show that the sortformer model outperforms the pyannote pipeline in diarization, while a fine-tuned Fast Conformer-CTC XLarge with Serialized Output Training achieves 7.29\% WER for ASR, surpassing zero-shot Whisper-large-v3. LibriConvo provides a valuable resource for advancing multi-speaker speech processing research with realistic conversational dynamics and controlled experimental conditions.

<title>Planning Ahead with RSA: Efficient Signalling in Dynamic Environments by Projecting User Awareness across Future Timesteps</title>

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication, formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA) modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However, progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data, a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions, visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models. Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model, trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5 languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for translating text directly from images.

<title>ISA-Bench: Benchmarking Instruction Sensitivity for Large Audio Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with large language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from audio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial communities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions are phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task performance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark evaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction description, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source and proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy under controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to degraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this issue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex instruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in instruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial catastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task capabilities when exposed to new instruction styles. Our benchmark provides a standardized basis for assessing and improving instruction sensitivity in LALMs, underscoring the need for instruction-robust audio understanding in real-world pipelines.

<title>ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23564</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.23564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at: https://riccizz.github.io/VMD.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs) to be effective in the financial domain -- where each decision can have a significant impact -- it is necessary to investigate realistic tasks and data. Financial professionals often interact with documents that are hundreds of pages long, but most financial research datasets only deal with short excerpts from these documents. To address this, we introduce a long-document financial QA task. We augment 7,437 questions from the existing FinQA dataset with the full-document context, extending the average context length from under 700 words in FinQA to 123k words in DocFinQA. We conduct extensive experiments over retrieval-based QA pipelines and long-context language models. DocFinQA proves a significant challenge for even state-of-the-art systems. We also provide a case-study on the longest documents in DocFinQA and find that models particularly struggle on these documents. Addressing these challenges may have a wide reaching impact across applications where specificity and long-range contexts are critical, like gene sequences and legal document contract analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly produce natural language explanations, yet these explanations often lack faithfulness, and they do not reliably reflect the evidence the model uses to decide. We introduce FaithLM, a model-agnostic framework that evaluates and improves the faithfulness of LLM explanations without token masking or task-specific heuristics. FaithLM formalizes explanation faithfulness as an intervention property: a faithful explanation should yield a prediction shift when its content is contradicted. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting contrary-hint score is a sound and discriminative estimator of faithfulness. Building on this principle, FaithLM iteratively refines both the elicitation prompt and the explanation to maximize the measured score. Experiments on three multi-domain datasets and multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that FaithLM consistently increases faithfulness and produces explanations more aligned with human rationales than strong self-explanation baselines. These findings highlight that intervention-based evaluation, coupled with iterative optimization, provides a principled route toward faithful and reliable LLM explanations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in many languages beyond English. Yet, LLMs require more inference steps when generating non-English text due to their reliance on English-centric tokenizers and vocabulary, resulting in higher usage costs to non-English speakers. Vocabulary expansion with target language tokens is a widely used cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation approach to remedy this issue. Despite its effectiveness in inference speedup, previous work on vocabulary expansion has focused on high-resource settings assuming access to a substantial amount of target language data to effectively initialize the embeddings of the new tokens and adapt the LLM to the target language. However, vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings has yet to be explored. In this article, we investigate vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings by considering embedding initialization methods and continual pre-training strategies. Through extensive experiments across typologically diverse languages, tasks and models, we establish a set of strategies to perform vocabulary expansion for faster inference, while striving to maintain competitive downstream performance to baselines. This is achieved with only 30K sentences ($\sim$0.01GB text data) from the target language.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly available ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives. This study examines the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate future research ideas from scientific papers. Unlike tasks such as summarization or translation, idea generation lacks a clearly defined reference set or structure, making manual evaluation the default standard. However, human evaluation in this setting is extremely challenging ie: it requires substantial domain expertise, contextual understanding of the paper, and awareness of the current research landscape. This makes it time-consuming, costly, and fundamentally non-scalable, particularly as new LLMs are being released at a rapid pace. Currently, there is no automated evaluation metric specifically designed for this task. To address this gap, we propose two automated evaluation metrics: Idea Alignment Score (IAScore) and Idea Distinctness Index. We further conducted human evaluation to assess the novelty, relevance, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas. We make our datasets and codes publicly available

Abstract: Fact-checking benchmarks provide standardized testing criteria for automated fact-checking systems, driving technological advancement. With the surge of misinformation on social media and the emergence of various fact-checking methods, public concern about the transparency of automated systems and the accuracy of fact-checking for high infulence events has grown. However, existing benchmarks fail to meet these urgent needs and are predominantly English-centric, hindering the progress of comprehensive fact-checking. To address these issues, we introduce TrendFact, the first benchmark capable of evaluating hotspot perception ability (HPA) and all fact-checking tasks. TrendFact consists of 7,643 curated samples sourced from trending platforms and professional fact-checking datasets, as well as an evidence library containing 366,634 entries with publication dates. Additionally, to complement existing benchmarks in evaluating system explanation consistency and HPA, we propose two new metrics: ECS and HCPI. Experimental results show that current fact-checking systems face significant limitations when evaluated on TrendFact, which facilitates the development of more robust fact-checking methods. Furthermore, to enhance the capabilities of existing advanced fact-checking systems, the reasoning large language models (RLMs), we propose FactISR, a reasoning framework that integrates dynamic evidence augmentation with influence score-based iterative self-reflection. FactISR effectively improves RLM's performance, offering new insights into explainable and complex fact-checking.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with limited data poses a practical challenge in low-resource languages, specialized domains, and constrained deployment settings. While pre-trained LLMs provide strong foundations, effective adaptation under data scarcity requires focused and efficient fine-tuning techniques. This paper presents a structured and practical survey of recent methods for fine-tuning LLMs in data-scarce scenarios. We systematically review parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques that lower training and deployment costs, domain and cross-lingual adaptation methods for both encoder and decoder models, and model specialization strategies. We further examine preference alignment approaches that guide model behavior using limited human or synthetic feedback, emphasizing sample and compute efficiency. Throughout, we highlight empirical trade-offs, selection criteria, and best practices for choosing suitable techniques based on task constraints, including model scaling, data scaling, and the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. The aim is to equip researchers and practitioners with actionable insights for effectively fine-tuning LLMs when data and resources are limited.

Abstract: Disfluencies are a natural feature of spontaneous human speech but are typically absent from the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). This absence can diminish the perceived naturalness of synthesized speech, which is an important criteria when building conversational agents that aim to mimick human behaviours. We show how the insertion of disfluencies can alleviate this shortcoming. The proposed approach involves (1) fine-tuning an LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to incorporate various types of disfluencies into LLM-generated utterances and (2) synthesizing those utterances using a text-to-speech model that supports the generation of speech phenomena such as disfluencies. We evaluated the quality of the generated speech across two metrics: intelligibility and perceived spontaneity. We demonstrate through a user study that the insertion of disfluencies significantly increase the perceived spontaneity of the generated speech. This increase came, however, along with a slight reduction in intelligibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly smaller variants, still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. While inference-time prompting can guide reasoning, existing methods often rely on sequential queries. Ensemble approaches offer a promising path to performance gains, especially given recent batch inference speed-ups. This work introduces DIPPER, a novel, training-free framework that transforms a single LLM into an effective inference-time ensemble. By feeding the model an optimized and diverse set of prompts in parallel, DIPPER elicits varied reasoning paths, leading to performance gains. We empirically demonstrate significant improvements on reasoning benchmarks, such as MATH, where a DIPPER ensemble of three Qwen2-MATH-1.5B instances (via parallel prompting of a single model) outperforms a larger 7B model.

Abstract: This work presents a computational approach to analyze character development along the narrative timeline. The analysis characterizes the inner and outer changes the protagonist undergoes within a narrative, and the interplay between them. We consider transcripts of Holocaust survivor testimonies as a test case, each telling the story of an individual in first-person terms. We focus on the survivor's religious trajectory, examining the evolution of their disposition toward religious belief and practice along the testimony. Clustering the resulting trajectories in the dataset, we identify common sequences in the data. Our findings highlight multiple common structures of religiosity across the narratives: in terms of belief, most present a constant disposition, while for practice, most present an oscillating structure, serving as valuable material for historical and sociological research. This work demonstrates the potential of natural language processing techniques for analyzing character evolution through thematic trajectories in narratives.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges translating case law under Hong Kong's bilingual legal system. It highlights the initial success of translating all written statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the Basic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal, linguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and culturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law remains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth of judicial decisions. The paper critiques the governments and judiciarys sporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with the thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the government acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a sustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciarys position that translating all judgments is unnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effectiveis analyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A proposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a human-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major transitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to using a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it evolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach, supported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of judicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and continuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual legal system.

<title>AttentionPredictor: Temporal Patterns Matter for KV Cache Compression</title>

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through static modeling of attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the temporal patterns in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based method to directly predict attention patterns for KV cache compression and critical token identification. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight, unified convolution model to dynamically capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention scores. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score and shares the unified prediction model, which consumes negligible memory, among all transformer layers. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 13$\times$ KV cache compression and 5.6$\times$ speedup in a cache offloading scenario with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-arts. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-AttentionPredictor.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, it typically assumes homogeneous preferences across users, overlooking diverse human values and minority viewpoints. Although personalized preference learning addresses this by tailoring separate preferences for individual users, the field lacks standardized methods to assess its effectiveness. We present a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness, unintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference divergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization methods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance differences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and personalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment. These findings highlight the critical need for holistic evaluation approaches to advance the development of more effective and inclusive preference learning systems.

<title>FaithUn: Toward Faithful Forgetting in Language Models by Investigating the Interconnectedness of Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Various studies have attempted to remove sensitive or private knowledge from a language model to prevent its unauthorized exposure. However, prior studies have overlooked the complex and interconnected nature of knowledge, where related knowledge must be carefully examined. Specifically, they have failed to evaluate whether an unlearning method faithfully erases interconnected knowledge that should be removed, retaining knowledge that appears relevant but exists in a completely different context. To resolve this problem, we first define a new concept called superficial unlearning, which refers to the phenomenon where an unlearning method either fails to erase the interconnected knowledge it should remove or unintentionally erases irrelevant knowledge. Based on the definition, we introduce a new benchmark, FaithUn, to analyze and evaluate the faithfulness of unlearning in real-world knowledge QA settings. Furthermore, we propose a novel unlearning method, KLUE, which updates only knowledge-related neurons to achieve faithful unlearning. KLUE identifies knowledge neurons using an explainability method and updates only those neurons using selected unforgotten samples. Experimental results demonstrate that widely-used unlearning methods fail to ensure faithful unlearning, while our method shows significant effectiveness in real-world QA unlearning.

Abstract: Periodicity, as one of the most important basic characteristics, lays the foundation for facilitating structured knowledge acquisition and systematic cognitive processes within human learning paradigms. However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which adapts Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. Our pretrained FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. Moreover, we reveal that FANformer exhibits superior ability to learn and apply rules for reasoning compared to Transformer. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents an extensive examination of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for embedding domain specific facts into Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on improving the fine-tuning process by categorizing question-answer (QA) pairs into Factual and Conceptual classes using a BERT-based classifier. Two distinct Llama-2 models are fine-tuned based on these classifications and evaluated using larger models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini. Our results indicate that models trained on conceptual datasets outperform those trained on factual datasets. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of two synthetic fine-tuning dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive, with D-Naive demonstrating superior performance. Although PEFT has shown effectiveness, our research indicates that it may not be the most optimal method for embedding facts into LLMs. However, it has demonstrated exceptional performance in instruction-based tasks. Our findings are reinforced by a 1000-sample dataset in the data center domain, where the fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model significantly outperforms the baseline model in generating product recommendations. Our study highlights the importance of QA pair categorization and synthetic dataset generation techniques in enhancing the performance of LLMs in specific domains.

Abstract: As scaled language models (LMs) approach human-level reasoning capabilities, self-improvement emerges as a solution to synthesizing high-quality data corpus. While previous research has identified model collapse as a risk in self-improvement, where model outputs become increasingly deterministic, we discover a more fundamental challenge: the superficial self-improved reasoners phenomenon. In particular, our analysis reveals that even when LMs show improved in-domain (ID) reasoning accuracy, they actually compromise their generalized reasoning capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) tasks due to memorization rather than genuine. Through a systematic investigation of LM architecture, we discover that during self-improvement, LM weight updates are concentrated in less reasoning-critical layers, leading to superficial learning. To address this, we propose Iterative Model Merging (IMM), a method that strategically combines weights from original and self-improved models to preserve generalization while incorporating genuine reasoning improvements. Our approach effectively mitigates both LM collapse and superficial learning, moving towards more stable self-improving systems.

Abstract: While RAG demonstrates remarkable capabilities in LLM applications, its effectiveness is hindered by the ever-increasing length of retrieved contexts, which introduces information redundancy and substantial computational overhead. Existing context pruning methods, such as LLMLingua, lack contextual awareness and offer limited flexibility in controlling compression rates, often resulting in either insufficient pruning or excessive information loss. In this paper, we propose AttentionRAG, an attention-guided context pruning method for RAG systems. The core idea of AttentionRAG lies in its attention focus mechanism, which reformulates RAG queries into a next-token prediction paradigm. This mechanism isolates the query's semantic focus to a single token, enabling precise and efficient attention calculation between queries and retrieved contexts. Extensive experiments on LongBench and Babilong benchmarks show that AttentionRAG achieves up to 6.3$\times$ context compression while outperforming LLMLingua methods by around 10\% in key metrics.

<title>Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate step. In addition, the cost of annotating reasoning processes for reward modeling is high, making large-scale collection of high-quality data challenging. To address this, we propose a novel reward model approach called the Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. HRM excels at assessing multi-step reasoning coherence, especially when flawed steps are later corrected through self-reflection. To further reduce the cost of generating training data, we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which merges two consecutive reasoning steps into one within the tree structure. By applying HNC to MCTS-generated reasoning trajectories, we enhance the diversity and robustness of HRM training data while introducing controlled noise with minimal computational overhead. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset show that HRM, together with HNC, provides more stable and reliable evaluations than PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets demonstrate HRM's strong generalization and robustness across a variety of reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed from text-based assistants to autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and iteratively improving their actions. While numerical reward signals and verifiers can effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the generative capabilities of LLMs, providing richer and more actionable suggestions. However, parsing and implementing this feedback effectively can be challenging for LLM-based agents. In this work, we introduce Critique-Guided Improvement (CGI), a novel two-player framework, comprising an actor model that explores an environment and a critic model that generates detailed nature language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a small critic model surpasses GPT-4 in feedback quality. The resulting actor achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the power of explicit iterative guidance to enhance decision-making in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt generalist models to specialized domains. However, recent studies show that fine-tuning can erode safety alignment, causing LLMs to respond to harmful or unethical prompts. Many methods to realign safety have been proposed, but often introduce custom algorithms that are difficult to implement or compromise task utility. In this work, we propose SafeMERGE, a lightweight, post-fine-tuning framework that preserves safety while maintaining downstream performance. SafeMERGE selectively merges fine-tuned with safety-aligned model layers only when they deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity criterion. Across three LLMs and two tasks, SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other defenses, with negligible or even positive impact on utility. Our results demonstrate that selective layer-wise merging offers an effective safeguard against the inadvertent loss of safety during fine-tuning, establishing SafeMERGE as a simple post-fine-tuning defense.

Abstract: Voice-based AI development faces unique challenges in processing both linguistic and paralinguistic information. This study compares how large audio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics during speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process speaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive mechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing patterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the models, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across social stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures) and biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant). Results revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for speaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted human N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker characteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like processing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and biological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the potential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized language, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms between humans and LALMs.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoEs) models scale the capacity of models while maintaining constant computational overhead. Early designs typically relied on a fixed value of $k$, where $k$ represents either the number of experts selected per token or the number of tokens assigned per expert. However, these approaches encounter three key limitations: they may fail to route to important experts or tokens, may assign irrelevant ones, and often suffer from representation collapse among experts. This paper reexamines SMoEs through the lens of \textit{Linear Programming}, and proposes a Unified Sparse Mixture of Experts (USMoE) framework that addresses these limitations. Specifically, our approach introduces a unified mechanism that integrates information from both the expert and token dimensions, and a unified scoring function that linearly combines similarity scores between experts and tokens. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical evidence demonstrating USMoE's effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of traditional routing methods. Through comprehensive evaluations on both clean and corrupted settings for large language models and vision tasks, under both training-free and training scenarios, USMoE achieves up to a 10\% performance improvement over standard approaches or reduces inference costs by up to 14\%, while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Stereotypes are known to have very harmful effects, making their detection critically important. However, current research predominantly focuses on detecting and evaluating stereotypical biases, thereby leaving the study of stereotypes in its early stages. Our study revealed that many works have failed to clearly distinguish between stereotypes and stereotypical biases, which has significantly slowed progress in advancing research in this area. Stereotype and Anti-stereotype detection is a problem that requires social knowledge; hence, it is one of the most difficult areas in Responsible AI. This work investigates this task, where we propose a five-tuple definition and provide precise terminologies disentangling stereotypes, anti-stereotypes, stereotypical bias, and general bias. We provide a conceptual framework grounded in social psychology for reliable detection. We identify key shortcomings in existing benchmarks for this task of stereotype and anti-stereotype detection. To address these gaps, we developed StereoDetect, a well curated, definition-aligned benchmark dataset designed for this task. We show that sub-10B language models and GPT-4o frequently misclassify anti-stereotypes and fail to recognize neutral overgeneralizations. We demonstrate StereoDetect's effectiveness through multiple qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmarks and models fine-tuned on them. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/StereoDetect.

Abstract: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/SEAL.

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has many applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), interpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.

Abstract: Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for medical information, making it critical to assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patient questions with patient details. In this paper, we first have three hematology-oncology physicians evaluate cancer-related questions drawn from real patients. While LLM responses are generally accurate, the models frequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions, posing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation systematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than $43\%$ of the time. To study mitigation strategies, we further construct a 150-question Cancer-Myth-NFP set, in which physicians confirm the absence of false presuppositions. We find typical mitigation strategies, such as adding precautionary prompts with GEPA optimization, can raise accuracy on Cancer-Myth to $80\%$, but at the cost of misidentifying presuppositions in $41\%$ of Cancer-Myth-NFP questions and causing a $10\%$ relative performance drop on other medical benchmarks. These findings highlight a critical gap in the reliability of LLMs, show that prompting alone is not a reliable remedy for false presuppositions, and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in medical AI systems.

<title>Unsupervised Classification of English Words Based on Phonological Information: Discovery of Germanic and Latinate Clusters</title>

Abstract: Cross-linguistically, native words and loanwords follow different phonological rules. In English, for example, words of Germanic and Latinate origin exhibit different stress patterns, and a certain syntactic structure, double-object datives, is predominantly associated with Germanic verbs rather than Latinate verbs. As a cognitive model, however, such etymology-based generalizations face challenges in terms of learnability, since the historical origins of words are presumably inaccessible information for general language learners. In this study, we present computational evidence indicating that the Germanic-Latinate distinction in the English lexicon is learnable from the phonotactic information of individual words. Specifically, we performed an unsupervised clustering on corpus-extracted words, and the resulting word clusters largely aligned with the etymological distinction. The model-discovered clusters also recovered various linguistic generalizations documented in the previous literature regarding the corresponding etymological classes. Moreover, our findings also uncovered previously unrecognized features of the quasi-etymological clusters.

<title>Know Me, Respond to Me: Benchmarking LLMs for Dynamic User Profiling and Personalized Responses at Scale</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as personalized assistants for users across a wide range of tasks -- from offering writing support to delivering tailored recommendations or consultations. Over time, the interaction history between a user and an LLM can provide extensive information about an individual's traits and preferences. However, open questions remain on how well LLMs today can effectively leverage such history to (1) internalize the user's inherent traits and preferences, (2) track how the user profiling and preferences evolve over time, and (3) generate personalized responses accordingly in new scenarios.
  In this work, we introduce the PERSONAMEM benchmark. PERSONAMEM features curated user profiles with over 180 simulated user-LLM interaction histories, each containing up to 60 sessions of multi-turn conversations across 15 real-world tasks that require personalization. Given an in-situ user query, i.e. query issued by the user from the first-person perspective, we evaluate LLM chatbots' ability to identify the most suitable response according to the current state of the user's profile. We observe that current LLMs still struggle to recognize the dynamic evolution in users' profiles over time through direct prompting approaches. As a consequence, LLMs often fail to deliver responses that align with users' current situations and preferences, with frontier models such as GPT-4.1, o4-mini, GPT-4.5, o1, or Gemini-2.0 achieving only around 50% overall accuracy, suggesting room for improvement. We hope that PERSONAMEM, along with the user profile and conversation simulation pipeline, can facilitate future research in the development of truly user-aware chatbots.

<title>Assessing the Potential of Generative Agents in Crowdsourced Fact-Checking</title>

Abstract: The growing spread of online misinformation has created an urgent need for scalable, reliable fact-checking solutions. Crowdsourced fact-checking - where non-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to expert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias. Encouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from centralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.
  In parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and evidence evaluation. However, their potential role in crowdsourced workflows remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLM-powered generative agents - autonomous entities that emulate human behavior and decision-making - can meaningfully contribute to fact-checking tasks traditionally reserved for human crowds.
  Using the protocol of La Barbera et al. (2024), we simulate crowds of generative agents with diverse demographic and ideological profiles. Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and issue final veracity judgments. Our results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable, consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on zeroth-order, comparison-based optimization via comparison oracles and provide convergence guarantees for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in Razin et al (2025).

Abstract: Content moderation research has recently made significant advances, but remains limited in serving the majority of the world's languages due to the lack of resources, leaving millions of vulnerable users to online hostility. This work presents a large-scale human-annotated multi-task benchmark dataset for abusive language detection in Tigrinya social media with joint annotations for three tasks: abusiveness, sentiment, and topic classification. The dataset comprises 13,717 YouTube comments annotated by nine native speakers, collected from 7,373 videos with a total of over 1.2 billion views across 51 channels. We developed an iterative term clustering approach for effective data selection. Recognizing that around 64% of Tigrinya social media content uses Romanized transliterations rather than native Ge'ez script, our dataset accommodates both writing systems to reflect actual language use. We establish strong baselines across the tasks in the benchmark, while leaving significant challenges for future contributions. Our experiments demonstrate that small fine-tuned models outperform prompted frontier large language models (LLMs) in the low-resource setting, achieving 86.67% F1 in abusiveness detection (7+ points over best LLM), and maintain stronger performance in all other tasks. The benchmark is made public to promote research on online safety.

<title>Breaking Language Barriers or Reinforcing Bias? A Study of Gender and Racial Disparities in Multilingual Contrastive Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models (VLMs) promise universal image-text retrieval, yet their social biases remain underexplored. We perform the first systematic audit of four public multilingual CLIP variants: M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, CAPIVARA-CLIP, and the debiased SigLIP-2, covering ten languages that differ in resource availability and morphological gender marking. Using balanced subsets of FairFace and the PATA stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the intuition that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender skew than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared encoder of NLLB-CLIP and SigLIP-2 transfers English gender stereotypes into gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this leakage. Although SigLIP-2 reduces agency and communion skews, it inherits -- and in caption-sparse contexts (e.g., Xhosa) amplifies -- the English anchor's crime associations. Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all bias types, yet gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable whenever cross-lingual weight sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics thus mask language-specific hot spots, underscoring the need for fine-grained, language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual VLM research.

<title>Gated Integration of Low-Rank Adaptation for Continual Learning of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), which requires the model to learn multiple tasks sequentially, is crucial for large language models (LLMs). Recently, low-rank adaptation~(LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LLMs. However, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA branch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to influence old tasks equally, potentially leading to forgetting. In this work, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation (GainLoRA), for CL of LLMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task and introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches. Furthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the influence from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating forgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results on CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models often contain factually incorrect or outdated knowledge, giving rise to model editing methods for precise knowledge updates. However, current mainstream locate-then-edit approaches exhibit a progressive performance decline during sequential editing, due to inadequate mechanisms for long-term knowledge preservation. To tackle this, we model the sequential editing as a constrained stochastic programming. Given the challenges posed by the cumulative preservation error constraint and the gradually revealed editing tasks, \textbf{LyapLock} is proposed. It integrates queuing theory and Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term constrained programming into tractable stepwise subproblems for efficient solving. This is the first model editing framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees, achieving asymptotic optimal editing performance while meeting the constraints of long-term knowledge preservation. Experimental results show that our framework scales sequential editing capacity to over 10,000 edits while stabilizing general capabilities and boosting average editing efficacy by 11.89\% over SOTA baselines. Furthermore, it can be leveraged to enhance the performance of baseline methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/caskcsg/LyapLock.

Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access external knowledge beyond their training data through retrieval-augmentation. While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process. Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language models.

Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is vital for automated scientific discovery, especially in cost-intensive, throughput-limited natural science domains. Current methods focus on pre-experiment ranking, relying solely on language model reasoning without empirical feedback. We introduce experiment-guided ranking, which prioritizes hypotheses based on feedback from prior tests. Due to the impracticality of real experiments, we propose a simulator grounded in domain-specific concepts that models hypothesis performance as a function of similarity to a hidden ground truth, perturbed by noise. Validated against 124 hypotheses with experimentally reported outcomes, the simulator approximates real results with consistent trend alignment. Although deviations exist, they mimic wet-lab noise, promoting more robust ranking strategies. We frame experiment-guided ranking as a sequential decision-making problem and propose an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) framework. Our LLM-based policy decomposes hypotheses into functional elements, clusters them by mechanistic roles, and prioritizes recombinations based on feedback. Experiments show our approach significantly outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations. Our toolkit, comprising the simulator and ICRL framework, enables systematic research on experiment-guided ranking, with the policy serving as a strong proof of concept.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/GenKI

Abstract: Lipograms are a unique form of constrained writing where all occurrences of a particular letter are excluded from the text, typified by the novel Gadsby, which daringly avoids all usage of the letter 'e'. In this study, we explore the power of modern large language models (LLMs) by transforming the novel F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby into a fully 'e'-less text. We experimented with a range of techniques, from baseline methods like synonym replacement to sophisticated generative models enhanced with beam search and named entity analysis. We show that excluding up to 3.6% of the most common letters (up to the letter 'u') had minimal impact on the text's meaning, although translation fidelity rapidly and predictably decays with stronger lipogram constraints. Our work highlights the surprising flexibility of English under strict constraints, revealing just how adaptable and creative language can be.

Abstract: Improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), which require expensive and manually annotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. This limitation has motivated a growing interest in unsupervised paradigms as a third stage of post-training after SFT and RL. While recent efforts have explored this direction, their methods are complex and difficult to iterate. To address this, we propose MM-UPT, a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs, enabling continual self-improvement without any external supervision. The training method of MM-UPT builds upon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism based on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments demonstrate that such training method effectively improves the reasoning ability of Qwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3\%$\rightarrow$72.9\% on MathVista, 62.9\%$\rightarrow$68.7\% on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth labels. To further explore scalability, we extend our framework to a data self-generation setting, designing two strategies that prompt the MLLM to synthesize new training samples on its own. Additional experiments show that combining these synthetic data with the unsupervised training method can also boost performance, highlighting a promising approach for scalable self-improvement. Overall, MM-UPT offers a new paradigm for autonomous enhancement of MLLMs, serving as a critical third step after initial SFT and RL in the absence of external supervision. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/MM-UPT.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitiveto prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliablegenerated text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate suchhallucinations and fragility, one of which is to measure theconsistency of LLM responses -- the model's confidence in the responseor likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled. Inprevious work, measuring LLM response consistency often relied oncalculating the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampledresponses, analyzing internal states, or evaluating logits of resopnses.However, it was not clear how well theseapproaches approximated users' perceptions of consistency of LLMresponses. To find out, we performed a user study ($n=2,976$)demonstrating that current methods for measuring LLM responseconsistency typically do not align well with humans' perceptions of LLMconsistency. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimatingLLM consistency and show that our method matches the performance of thebest-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLMconsistency. Our results suggest that methods for estimating LLMconsistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect towarrant broader use of evaluation with human input; this would avoidmisjudging the adequacy of models because of the imperfections ofautomated consistency metrics.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as an effective alternative medicine, has been receiving increasing attention. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has highlighted the urgent need for an objective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on real-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope and primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal question-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce TCM-Ladder, the first comprehensive multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for evaluating large TCM language models. The dataset covers multiple core disciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas, internal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to textual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and videos. The dataset was constructed using a combination of automated and manual filtering processes and comprises over 52,000 questions. These questions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic dialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on TCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against nine state-of-the-art general domain and five leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on the dataset. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method specifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses answer quality in terms of terminology usage and semantic expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate mainstream general domain and TCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark. The datasets and leaderboard are publicly available at https://tcmladder.com and will be continuously updated.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). However, existing layer pruning approaches often incur substantial performance degradation. We identify the majority of this degradation to a single yet previously overlooked issue: \textit{the mismatch of activation magnitudes at the pruning interface}. The pre-interface activations exhibit significantly different scales from the post-interface ones, causing the distributional shift as it propagates through the remaining layers. To address this issue, we introduce \textsc{LinearPatch}, a lightweight and plug-and-play technique that fuses two operations into one matrix multiply at the pruning interface: (i) a Hadamard transformation that suppresses massive outliers at particular tokens and (ii) a channel-wise scaling that aligns activation statistics. On LLaMA-3-8B, \textsc{LinearPatch} preserves up to \textbf{94.15\%} of the original model's performance when pruning 5 out of 32 layers, outperforming the previous state of the art by \textbf{4\%}. The patch can be further refined with 5K unlabeled samples via memory-efficient offline distillation, pushing the retention to 95.16\% within only 30 minutes on a single GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/chenxinrui-tsinghua/LinearPatch.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum $k$ up to 256), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@1 but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$ performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

Abstract: Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge. Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources. However, existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM), neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approaches. The results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience research corpus. The performance of the proposed entity and relation extraction method is comparable to the existing supervised method. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction from the unlabeled data. The knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 52% of neuroscience questions from the PubMedQA dataset and questions generated using selected neuroscience entities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information. Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational overhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system configuration, such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version, can introduce significant differences in the generated responses. This issue is especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware, software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision - while critical for reproducibility - is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32, balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

<title>Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning, but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information. However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Abstract: We study unsupervised clustering of documents at both the category and template levels using frozen multimodal encoders and classical clustering algorithms. We systematize a model-agnostic pipeline that (i) projects heterogeneous last-layer states from text-layout-vision encoders into token-type-aware document vectors and (ii) performs clustering with centroid- or density-based methods, including an HDBSCAN + $k$-NN assignment to eliminate unlabeled points. We evaluate eight encoders (text-only, layout-aware, vision-only, and vision-language) with $k$-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN + $k$-NN, and BIRCH on five corpora spanning clean synthetic invoices, their heavily degraded print-and-scan counterparts, scanned receipts, and real identity and certificate documents. The study reveals modality-specific failure modes and a robustness-accuracy trade-off, with vision features nearly solving template discovery on clean pages while text dominates under covariate shift, and fused encoders offering the best balance. We detail a reproducible, oracle-free tuning protocol and the curated evaluation settings to guide future work on unsupervised document organization.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses. We open-source our code at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF and LLM-generated explanations at https://huggingface.co/collections/uofthcdslab/haf.

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training. As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within 0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience. Code and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk.

Our broad findings provide insights into the distributional alignment of LLMs with diverse population groups. By conducting evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing our work, we provide a benchmark to stimulate future research.

Abstract: Current RLHF methods such as PPO and DPO typically reduce human preferences to binary labels, which are costly to obtain and too coarse to reflect individual variation. We observe that expressions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction follow stable linguistic patterns across users, indicating that more informative supervisory signals can be extracted from free-form feedback. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), which converts natural feedback into continuous preference trajectories and optimizes them using the novel TraceBias algorithm. Across diverse LLMs and preference domains, ARF consistently outperforms PPO and DPO, improving alignment by up to 7.6%. Our results demonstrate that continuous reward modeling provides a scalable path toward personalized and theoretically grounded RLHF.

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior, we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate innovation in empathetic speech systems.

Abstract: AI agent frameworks operate in isolation, forcing agents to rediscover solutions and repeat mistakes across different systems. Despite valuable problem-solving experiences accumulated by frameworks like smolagents, OpenHands, and OWL, this knowledge remains trapped within individual systems, preventing the emergence of collective intelligence. Current memory systems focus on individual agents or framework-specific demonstrations, failing to enable cross-architecture knowledge transfer. We introduce AGENT KB, a universal memory infrastructure enabling seamless experience sharing across heterogeneous agent frameworks without retraining. AGENT KB aggregates trajectories into a structured knowledge base and serves lightweight APIs. At inference time, hybrid retrieval operates through two stages: planning seeds agents with cross-domain workflows, while feedback applies targeted diagnostic fixes. A disagreement gate ensures retrieved knowledge enhances rather than disrupts reasoning, addressing knowledge interference in cross-framework transfer. We validate AGENT KB across major frameworks on GAIA, Humanity's Last Exam, GPQA, and SWE-bench. Results show substantial improvements across diverse model families: compared to baseline pass@1, smolagents with AGENT KB achieve up to 18.7pp gains at pass@3 (55.2% -> 73.9%), while OpenHands improves 4.0pp on SWE-bench pass@1 (24.3% -> 28.3%). Similar improvements are observed across all base model families. Ablations confirm that hybrid retrieval and feedback stages are essential, with automatically generated experiences matching manual curation. This establishes the foundation for collective agent intelligence through shared memory infrastructures.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We release our training codebase on open-source data at https://github.com/microsoft/ArchScale.

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual domain-specific scenarios, with substantial performance drops occurring when the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking documents across languages. Finally, we propose two simple retrieval strategies that address this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both languages or by translating the query, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection, toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate community engagement, with the motivation that DATE-LM can serve as a foundation for future data attribution research in LLMs.

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to further decrease memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2) Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation. To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual operations.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation. We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 78.0% and 34.3% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 100 turns and output tokens exceeding 400k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 51.1 on xBench and 58.7 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. Finally, we also show that ASearcher-Web-QwQ could achieve performance of commercial systems using external summary tool in a zero-shot transfer manner and test-time search. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but it is unclear where the benefit comes from. To this end, we perform a controlled study that scales the vocabulary of the language model from 24K to 196K while holding data, computation, and optimization unchanged. We begin by quantifying the complexity of tokenized text -- formalized via Kolmogorov complexity -- and show that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already tokenized as a single token, so enlarging vocabulary only deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. Word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy loss almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. The same frequent words cover roughly 75% of tokens in downstream benchmarks, so this training advantage transfers intact. We further show that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. Our results recast "bigger vocabularies help" as "lowering complexity of tokenized text helps," offering a simple, principled knob for tokenizer--model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics that govern language model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First, we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Background: Evidence synthesis facilitates evidence-based medicine. This task becomes increasingly difficult to accomplished with applying computational solutions, since the medical literature grows at astonishing rates. Objective: This study evaluates an information retrieval-driven workflow, CASMA, to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility of systematic reviews. Endometriosis recurrence serves as the ideal case due to its complex and ambiguous literature. Methods: The hybrid approach integrates PRISMA guidelines with fuzzy matching and regular expression (regex) to facilitate semi-automated deduplication and filtered records before manual screening. The workflow synthesised evidence from randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of a subclass of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a). A modified splitting method addressed unit-of-analysis errors in multi-arm trials. Results: The workflow sharply reduced the screening workload, taking only 11 days to fetch and filter 33,444 records. Seven eligible RCTs were synthesized (841 patients). The pooled random-effects model yielded a Risk Ratio (RR) of $0.64$ ($95\%$ CI $0.48$ to $0.86$), demonstrating a $36\%$ reduction in recurrence, with non-significant heterogeneity ($I^2=0.00\%$, $\tau^2=0.00$). The findings were robust and stable, as they were backed by sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an application of an information-retrieval-driven workflow for medical evidence synthesis. The approach yields valuable clinical results and a generalisable framework to scale up the evidence synthesis, bridging the gap between clinical research and computer science.

Abstract: Contemporary theories model language processing as integrating both top-down expectations and bottom-up inputs. One major prediction of such models is that the quality of the bottom-up inputs modulates ease of processing -- noisy inputs should lead to difficult and effortful comprehension. We test this prediction in the domain of reading. First, we propose an information-theoretic operationalization for the "quality" of bottom-up information as the mutual information (MI) between visual information and word identity. We formalize this prediction in a mathematical model of reading as a Bayesian update. Second, we test our operationalization by comparing participants' reading times in conditions where words' information quality has been reduced, either by occluding their top or bottom half, with full words. We collect data in English and Chinese. We then use multimodal language models to estimate the mutual information between visual inputs and words. We use these data to estimate the specific effect of reduced information quality on reading times. Finally, we compare how information is distributed across visual forms. In English and Chinese, the upper half contains more information about word identity than the lower half. However, the asymmetry is more pronounced in English, a pattern which is reflected in the reading times.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support, content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy drop in non-English languages compared to English. We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves non-English accuracy by up to 23.9% without compromising English performance, model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training & deployment pipelines, enabling more robust and equitable multilingual AI solutions in industry.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality performance across languages requires substantial training data for each individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages, they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the usefulness of our approach.

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that inject  at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\% to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors the log-probability margin between  and the current top token at sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small. Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions provide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction. The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on moral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic self-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and provide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our experimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of convergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral concepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the activated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper demonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it exhibits a desirable property of converged performance.

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced, context sensitive aspects of populism.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models (LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word), captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA) prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open- and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues. Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally, building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However, emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture, and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Our approach combines two complementary strategies: (i) lightweight prompting techniques in the API track, including a Deflanderization prompting method to suppress excessive role-play and improve task fidelity, and (ii) fine-tuned large models in the GPU track, leveraging Qwen3-14B with supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA). Our best submissions ranked 2nd on Task 1, 2nd on Task 3 (API track), and 4th on Task 3 (GPU track).

Abstract: Improving the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an active research topic. As a common data structure in many real-world domains, understanding graph data is a crucial part of advancing general intelligence. To this end, we propose a dynamic benchmark named GraphInstruct in this paper, which comprehensively includes 21 classical graph reasoning tasks, providing diverse graph generation pipelines and detailed intermediate reasoning steps for each sample. Based on GraphInstruct, we develop GraphSolver via efficient instruction-tuning, which demonstrates prominent graph understanding capability compared to other open-sourced LLMs. To further endow LLMs with multi-step graph reasoning capability, we propose a label-mask training strategy and build GraphSolver+, which leverages masked supervision on intermediate reasoning tokens to emphasize crucial node-identification signals. As one of the pioneering efforts to enhance the graph understanding and reasoning abilities of LLMs, extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GraphSolver and GraphSolver+ over other LLMs. We sincerely hope GraphInstruct will facilitate further research on applying LLMs to graph-structured data. Our code and data are released publicly at: https://github.com/CGCL-codes/GraphInstruct.

Abstract: Referring understanding is a fundamental task that bridges natural language and visual content by localizing objects described in free-form expressions. However, existing works are constrained by limited language expressiveness, lacking the capacity to model object dynamics in spatial numbers and temporal states. To address these limitations, we introduce a new and general referring understanding task, termed referring multi-object tracking (RMOT). Its core idea is to employ a language expression as a semantic cue to guide the prediction of multi-object tracking, comprehensively accounting for variations in object quantity and temporal semantics. Along with RMOT, we introduce a RMOT benchmark named Refer-KITTI-V2, featuring scalable and diverse language expressions. To efficiently generate high-quality annotations covering object dynamics with minimal manual effort, we propose a semi-automatic labeling pipeline that formulates a total of 9,758 language prompts. In addition, we propose TempRMOT, an elegant end-to-end Transformer-based framework for RMOT. At its core is a query-driven Temporal Enhancement Module that represents each object as a Transformer query, enabling long-term spatial-temporal interactions with other objects and past frames to efficiently refine these queries. TempRMOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Refer-KITTI and Refer-KITTI-V2, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The source code and dataset is available at https://github.com/zyn213/TempRMOT.

Abstract: Modern engineered systems increasingly involve complex sociotechnical environments where multiple agents, including humans and the emerging paradigm of agentic AI powered by large language models, must navigate social dilemmas that pit individual interests against collective welfare. As engineered systems evolve toward multi-agent architectures with autonomous LLM-based agents, traditional governance approaches using static rules or fixed network structures fail to address the dynamic uncertainties inherent in real-world operations. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates adaptive governance mechanisms directly into the design of sociotechnical systems through a unique separation of agent interaction networks from information flow networks. We introduce a system comprising strategic LLM-based system agents that engage in repeated interactions and a reinforcement learning-based governing agent that dynamically modulates information transparency. Unlike conventional approaches that require direct structural interventions or payoff modifications, our framework preserves agent autonomy while promoting cooperation through adaptive information governance. The governing agent learns to strategically adjust information disclosure at each timestep, determining what contextual or historical information each system agent can access. Experimental results demonstrate that this RL-based governance significantly enhances cooperation compared to static information-sharing baselines.

<title>Learning to Better Search with Language Models via Guided Reinforced Self-Training</title>

Abstract: While language models have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks, they still encounter challenges in complex reasoning scenarios. Recent research suggests that language models trained on linearized search traces toward solutions, rather than solely on the final solutions, exhibit improved generalization, despite the search traces being potentially noisy or suboptimal. However, relying on such imperfect traces can result in inefficient use of test-time compute. To address this, we propose guided reinforced self-training (Guided-ReST), a fine-tuning algorithm designed to improve the model's capability for effective search during inference. The key insight behind Guided-ReST is that optimal solutions can serve as valuable step-by-step landmarks to guide the model's search process. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel data generation method that seamlessly incorporates optimal solutions into the model's search procedure, enabling the generation of high-quality search traces. By fine-tuning the model on these search traces, we effectively distill improved search strategies into the model. Our method significantly enhances the search capabilities of language models on arithmetic reasoning and code self-repair tasks, including Countdown, CodeContests, and CodeForces. We release the source code at https://github.com/snu-mllab/guided-rest.

<title>Temporal Relational Reasoning of Large Language Models for Detecting Stock Portfolio Crashes</title>

Abstract: Stock portfolios are often exposed to rare consequential events (e.g., 2007 global financial crisis, 2020 COVID-19 stock market crash), as they do not have enough historical information to learn from. Large Language Models (LLMs) now present a possible tool to tackle this problem, as they can generalize across their large corpus of training data and perform zero-shot reasoning on new events, allowing them to detect possible portfolio crash events without requiring specific training data. However, detecting portfolio crashes is a complex problem that requires more than reasoning abilities. Investors need to dynamically process the impact of each new piece of information found in news articles, analyze the relational network of impacts across different events and portfolio stocks, as well as understand the temporal context between impacts across time-steps, in order to obtain the aggregated impact on the target portfolio. In this work, we propose an algorithmic framework named Temporal Relational Reasoning (TRR). It seeks to emulate the spectrum of human cognitive capabilities used for complex problem-solving, which include brainstorming, memory, attention and reasoning. Through extensive experiments, we show that TRR is able to outperform state-of-the-art techniques on detecting stock portfolio crashes, and demonstrate how each of the proposed components help to contribute to its performance through an ablation study. Additionally, we further explore the possible applications of TRR by extending it to other related complex problems, such as the detection of possible global crisis events in Macroeconomics.

<title>FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation</title>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial prefill computation and key-value (KV) cache, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage in both prefill and decoding stages. Recent works that compress KV caches with prefill acceleration reduce this cost but inadvertently tie the prefill compute reduction to the decoding KV budget. This coupling arises from overlooking the layer-dependent variation of critical context, often leading to accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression framework designed to reduce latency in both prefill and decoding by leveraging the stabilization of token importance in later layers. FastKV performs full-context computation until a Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) layer, which forwards only the most informative tokens to subsequent layers. From these propagated tokens, FastKV independently selects salient KV entries for caching, thereby decoupling KV budget from the prefill compute reduction based on the TSP decision. This independent control of the TSP rate and KV retention rate enables flexible optimization of efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that FastKV achieves speedups of up to 1.82$\times$ in prefill and 2.87$\times$ in decoding compared to the full-context baseline, while matching the accuracy of the baselines that only accelerate the decoding stage. Our code is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV.

Abstract: Listeners adapt language comprehension based on their mental representations of speakers, but how these representations are updated remains unclear. We investigated whether listeners probabilistically adapt comprehension based on the frequency of speakers making stereotype-incongruent statements. In two EEG experiments, participants heard speakers make stereotype-congruent or incongruent statements, with incongruency base rate manipulated. In Experiment 1, stereotype-incongruent statements decreased high-beta (21-30 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) oscillatory power in the low base rate condition but increased it in the high base rate condition. The theta effect varied with listeners' openness trait: less open-minded participants tended to show theta increases to stereotype incongruencies, while more open-minded participants tended to show theta decreases. In Experiment 2, we dissociated incongruency base rate from the target speaker by manipulating it using a non-target speaker and found that only the high-beta effect persisted. Our findings reveal two potential mechanisms: a speaker-general mechanism (indicated by high-beta oscillations) that adjusts overall expectations about hearing statements that violate social stereotypes, and a speaker-specific mechanism (indicated by theta oscillations) that updates a more detailed mental model specifically about an individual speaker. These findings provide evidence for how language processing interacts with social cognition.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that diffusion models can achieve font-controllable multilingual text rendering using just raw images without font label annotations.Visual text rendering remains a significant challenge. While recent methods condition diffusion on glyphs, it is impossible to retrieve exact font annotations from large-scale, real-world datasets, which prevents user-specified font control. To address this, we propose a data-driven solution that integrates the conditional diffusion model with a text segmentation model, utilizing segmentation masks to capture and represent fonts in pixel space in a self-supervised manner, thereby eliminating the need for any ground-truth labels and enabling users to customize text rendering with any multilingual font of their choice. The experiment provides a proof of concept of our algorithm in zero-shot text and font editing across diverse fonts and languages, providing valuable insights for the community and industry toward achieving generalized visual text rendering.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have enhanced video editing, but it remains challenging to handle instructional editing and diverse tasks (e.g., adding, removing, changing) within a unified framework. In this paper, we introduce VEGGIE, a Video Editor with Grounded Generation from Instructions, a simple end-to-end framework that unifies video concept editing, grounding, and reasoning based on diverse user instructions. Specifically, given a video and text query, VEGGIE first utilizes an MLLM to interpret user intentions in instructions and ground them to the video contexts, generating frame-specific grounded task queries for pixel-space responses. A diffusion model then renders these plans and generates edited videos that align with user intent. To support diverse tasks and complex instructions, we employ a curriculum learning strategy: first aligning the MLLM and video diffusion model with large-scale instructional image editing data, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning on high-quality multitask video data. Additionally, we introduce a novel data synthesis pipeline to generate paired instructional video editing data for model training. It transforms static image data into diverse, high-quality video editing samples by leveraging Image-to-Video models to inject dynamics. VEGGIE shows strong performance in instructional video editing with different editing skills, outperforming the best instructional baseline as a versatile model, while other models struggle with multi-tasking. VEGGIE also excels in video object grounding and reasoning segmentation, where other baselines fail. We further reveal how the multiple tasks help each other and highlight promising applications like zero-shot multimodal instructional and in-context video editing.

<title>QuestBench: Can LLMs ask the right question to acquire information in reasoning tasks?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks like math and logic. While many works have largely assumed well-defined tasks, real-world queries are often underspecified and only solvable by acquiring missing information. We formalize this information-gathering problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with partially-observed initial states, (3) GSM-Q: human-annotated grade school math problems with one unknown variable, and (4) GSME-Q: equation-based version of GSM-Q. The LLM must select the correct clarification question from multiple options. While current models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, they achieve only 40-50% accuracy on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis shows that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems is not sufficient for success on our benchmark: models struggle to identify the right question even when they can solve the fully specified version. This highlights the need for specifically optimizing models' information acquisition capabilities.

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance. Antidistillation sampling provides exactly this capability. By strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution, antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's practical utility.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation. Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osworld-grounding.github.io.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates extensive sensory contexts surrounding humans to enhance the proactivity of LLM agents. ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions. ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and personas from historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/openaiotlab/ContextAgent.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories: (i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts, finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference, reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN, leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5% ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4% better performance preservation compared to existing methods. Our specialized kernel implementations effectively realize these theoretical gains into substantial real-world acceleration.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality. BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance. However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace, enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity. Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on telecom datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue by fine-tuning LLMs on three representative telecom datasets and show that safety degrades even for light telecom domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce TeleHarm, the first telecom-specific red-teaming benchmark, which we use alongside established Direct-Harm and HexPhi datasets to systematically assess harmful behavior. We further extend our analysis to publicly available TeleLLMs that were continually pre-trained on large telecom corpora, revealing that safety alignment is severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment defenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising telecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. Our work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain.

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0% gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term tactical decisions consistent with long-term financial objectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to such problems, but adoption is limited by myopic behaviour and opaque policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts. This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD). Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search. BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning; (2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment. TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

Abstract: We give a simple replacement for the contested "domain-extension" in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows (Chen, 2024). As acknowledged by the author, the reported issue is due to a periodicity/support mismatch when extending only the first coordinate in the presence of offsets, which breaks the intended $\mathbb{Z}_P$-fiber. Our new subroutine replaces domain extension by a pair-shift difference that cancels unknown offsets exactly and synthesizes a uniform cyclic subgroup (a zero-offset coset) of order $P$ inside $(\mathbb{Z}_{M_2})^n$. We adopt a gate-level access model and run a short prepass that measures the designated outcome registers (Chen's Steps 1, 3, and 5), fixing $E=(y',z',h^{\ast})$. We then identify a concrete program point $t^{\star}$ at which an index wire $J \in \mathbb{Z}_P$ is preserved and the coordinate block equals $\mathbf{X}(j)\equiv 2D^2 j\,\mathbf{b}^{\ast}+\mathbf{v}^{\ast}\ (\bmod M_2)$. A compute-copy-uncompute sandwich on the prefix up to $t^{\star}$ yields a reversible evaluator that we call only on basis inputs $j=0,1$ to harvest $V=\mathbf{X}(0)$ and $\Delta=\mathbf{X}(1)-\mathbf{X}(0)\equiv 2D^2\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ within the same run. We never invert a measurement, and we do not claim the circuit suffix after $t^{\star}$. The default Step $9^{\dagger}$ uses only $\Delta$ (no foreknowledge of $\mathbf{b}^\ast$): set $\mathbf{Z}\leftarrow -\,T\cdot \Delta\ (\bmod M_2)$ for uniform $T\in\mathbb{Z}_P$ and erase $T$ coherently primewise by modular inversion and CRT.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could significantly damage the performance and robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on these datasets. As the size of modern DNNs grows, there is a growing demand for automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc, model-agnostic noise detection and rectification methods utilizing the penultimate feature from a DNN. Our idea is based on the observation that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that our approach achieves high detection performance across diverse, realistic noise scenarios and can automatically rectify these errors to improve dataset quality. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/noise-detection-and-rectification-AD8E.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Schema Activated In Context Learning (SA-ICL) as a framework that leverages cognitive science principles, specifically schema theory, to enhance transformer-based language models. SA-ICL extracts and utilizes abstracted schemas from prior examples to improve a model's reasoning process when faced with new questions. It addresses the limitations of traditional example-driven in-context learning by providing explicit schema-based scaffolding. Experimental results on chemistry and physics questions show that SA-ICL significantly boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, with high-quality demonstration examples. This approach reduces the reliance on multiple demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SA-ICL bridges different in-context learning strategies and offers a new direction for improving human-like reasoning in large language models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science, specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential in End-to-End Software Development (E2ESD). However, existing E2ESD benchmarks are limited by coarse-grained requirement specifications and unreliable evaluation protocols, hindering a true understanding of current framework capabilities. To address these limitations, we present E2EDev, a novel benchmark grounded in the principles of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), which evaluates the capabilities of E2ESD frameworks by assessing whether the generated software meets user needs through mimicking real user interactions (Figure 1). E2EDev comprises (i) a fine-grained set of user requirements, (ii) multiple BDD test scenarios with corresponding Python step implementations for each requirement, and (iii) a fully automated testing pipeline built on the Behave framework. To ensure its quality while reducing the annotation effort, E2EDev leverages our proposed Human-in-the-Loop Multi-Agent Annotation Framework (HITL-MAA). By evaluating various E2ESD frameworks and LLM backbones with E2EDev, our analysis reveals a persistent struggle to effectively solve these tasks, underscoring the critical need for more effective and cost-efficient E2ESD solutions.

Summary:
This article explores the rationality of language model (LM) agents in information-seeking tasks through a dialogue-based game called Collaborative Battleship. Comparing human players to LM agents, the study reveals that LM agents struggle with context grounding, generating informative questions, and selecting high-value actions. To address these shortcomings, the authors develop Monte Carlo inference strategies based on Bayesian Experimental Design principles. These strategies significantly improve accuracy for Spotter agents and enhance expected information gain for Captain agents. As a result, weaker LMs like Llama-4-Scout outperform humans and frontier models at a fraction of the cost of larger models like GPT-5. The methods also show promising results in a Guess Who? game, indicating their general applicability in building rational information-seeking agents.

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration (asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next, to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs, such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for building rational information-seeking agents.

By combining natural language reasoning with code execution, CodeAdapt allows language models to outperform specialized reasoning models across various domains. This approach is efficient in terms of tokens used and demonstrates superior performance on multiple tasks. The code-augmented reasoning traces exhibit diverse problem-solving strategies, highlighting the robustness and domain generalizability of this method. Overall, CodeAdapt shows that code-enabled language models are powerful systems with the potential to serve as a foundation for reinforcement learning. This research supports the notion that this style of learning and reasoning is cognitively grounded and can provide significant advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt, our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems. Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%). Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

Summary:
The article discusses the increasing interest in using language models in computational literary studies, as they become more adept at processing longer and more complex texts. To evaluate these models for literary tasks, a new dataset called FICSIM has been created, consisting of long-form fiction with scores across 12 similarity axes based on author-provided metadata. Various embedding models were tested on this dataset, revealing a focus on surface-level features rather than semantic categories relevant to literary analysis. Throughout the data collection process, author agency and consent were prioritized. This dataset aims to bridge the gap in evaluating language models for literary tasks by providing a more suitable benchmark for long-form, contemporary fiction. The study highlights the importance of considering author input and maintaining ethical standards in computational literary analysis.

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex texts, there has been growing interest in their application within computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process, we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding. Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations: (1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training; (2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures -- models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts.

<div> Irish, BLiMP, linguistic competence, Large Language Models, grammar 
Summary: 
The Irish-BLiMP dataset and framework were introduced to assess linguistic competence in the endangered Irish language. Through manual construction of minimal pairs, 11 linguistic features were evaluated by a team of fluent Irish speakers. Results showed that humans outperformed all models, with a significant performance gap between open- and closed-source Large Language Models. Despite the strong gpt-5 model, human accuracy remained higher. Different struggles were observed between human participants and models, indicating a difference in learned representation. Irish-BLiMP offers a systematic approach to evaluating LLMs in Irish, serving as a benchmark for linguistic understanding in low-resource languages.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features, through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover, a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic understanding in low-resource languages.

<div> confidence-gated, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), large language models, reasoning abilities, training-free

Summary:
In the study, the authors introduce confidence-gated CoT prompting as a method to enhance reasoning abilities in large language models. They address the challenge of determining when CoT should be used by proposing a gating mechanism that triggers reasoning only when the model's confidence in its direct answer is low. The study evaluates four training-free confidence estimation methods and compares them to baseline approaches, demonstrating that existing measures can reduce redundant CoT and improve performance. However, the effectiveness of individual confidence measures varies depending on the dataset and model, highlighting the challenges of practical deployment. The research sheds light on both the potential benefits and limitations of these methods and offers insights for more reliable adaptive gating of CoT. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

Summary:
- Input structure significantly impacts the accuracy of LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data.
- Hallucinations and factual errors are major concerns in accuracy-critical domains like sports reporting.
- Manual annotations identified 3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries generated by Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B.
- JSON input format reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured input.
- Row-structured input also reduces errors, by 54% for Llama and 51% for Qwen.
- A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for over 80% of the variance in error rates.
- Tukey HSD post hoc tests confirm statistically significant differences between all input formats.

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated 3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models, Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

<div> reasoning, language models, classification, false positive rate, precision-sensitive

Summary: 
The study examines the impact of reasoning on classification tasks with low false positive rate (FPR) requirements. Two tasks, safety detection, and hallucination detection, are evaluated using standard language models and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). It is found that reasoning improves overall accuracy but is less effective in precision-sensitive situations where low FPR is crucial. Token-based scoring outperforms self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Think Off (no reasoning during inference) performs better than Think On (reasoning-augmented) in precision-sensitive regimes. A simple ensemble of both modes combines their strengths effectively. The results suggest that while reasoning enhances average accuracy, it may not always be suitable for applications that demand strict precision. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs), consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict precision.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, in-context knowledge editing, Dynamic Retriever, BERT retriever, REINFORCE

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown excellence in factual recall but struggle with propagating outdated or incorrect knowledge. Existing in-context knowledge editing methods face challenges such as a trade-off between quantity and quality of supporting demonstrations and lack of adaptivity to task difficulty. To address these issues, a new framework called Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE) is proposed. DR-IKE leverages a BERT retriever trained with REINFORCE to rank supporting demonstrations based on editing rewards, and uses a learnable threshold to prune low-value examples, adjusting prompt length according to task complexity. By dynamically selecting demonstrations, DR-IKE improves edit success, reduces latency, and maintains accuracy on unrelated queries. This framework allows for scalable and adaptive knowledge editing without modifying model weights, making it compatible with black-box LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to 17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries, demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing.

Summary:  
Adaptive RAG system was implemented to address the limitations in Indonesian language question answering. A classifier was used to determine question complexity, which guided the answering strategy. Machine translation was employed for data augmentation due to limited Indonesian language dataset availability. Results showed a reliable complexity classifier, but inconsistencies were observed in the multi-retrieval answering strategy, leading to negative overall evaluation. This study sheds light on the potential and challenges of question answering in low-resource languages, emphasizing the need for further improvements in this field.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However, these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language suggesting directions for future improvement.

<div> Keywords: Intelligent drug recommendation, Electronic Health Records, Chinese dataset, Metabolic diseases, Large language models 

Summary: 
Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is crucial for enhancing clinical decision-making efficiency. The lack of publicly available real-world EHR datasets in languages other than English hinders the advancement of such systems. To address this gap, CDrugRed, a Chinese drug recommendation dataset focusing on discharge medications for metabolic diseases, is introduced. The dataset contains 5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients with comprehensive information. Several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) were benchmarked on the dataset for the discharge medication recommendation task. Although supervised fine-tuning improved model performance, there is still room for enhancement, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 0.5648 and a Jaccard score of 0.4477. CDrugRed provides a challenging and valuable resource for developing more accurate drug recommendation systems. The dataset is publicly available to the research community for further exploration.

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets, particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes 5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems. The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data usage agreements at https://github.com/DUTIR-BioNLP/CDrugRed.

<div> Keywords: Supervised fine-tuning, large language models, self-rewarding PPO, generalization, natural language processing<br />
<br />
Summary: 
Self-Rewarding PPO is proposed as a novel fine-tuning method for aligning large language models with human-annotated demonstrations. It leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance, combining supervised fine-tuning and proximal policy optimization. The reward function used is the log policy ratio between the fine-tuned model and the pretrained base model, serving as an implicit reward signal for on-policy fine-tuning. This self-rewarding mechanism addresses limitations of traditional supervised fine-tuning, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Empirical evaluation across various natural language processing tasks shows that Self-Rewarding PPO outperforms standard methods, particularly in scenarios with limited high-quality annotated data. <div>
arXiv:2510.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT, being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data, particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

<div> hallucinations, verification, annotation framework, unfaithfulness detection, large language models

Summary:
The article introduces a new faithfulness annotation framework to address the ambiguity in existing benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to classify cases where external knowledge is necessary for verification. The VeriGray benchmark is constructed using this framework and reveals that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit hallucinations in summarization tasks. A notable portion of generated sentences falls into the Out-Dependent category, emphasizing the need to clarify external knowledge boundaries in unfaithfulness detection benchmarks. Experiments show that the benchmark poses challenges to baseline methods, highlighting opportunities for improvement in LLM summarization models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences) in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category, underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable room for future improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation. However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and graph learning.

Summary: 
This article introduces a framework for analyzing large language models (LLMs) in social simulation. Through chatroom-style interactions, the study examines five linguistic dimensions to identify emergent social cognitive biases. Experiments on eight LLMs reveal a divergence from authentic human behavior, showing biases such as social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias. LLMs tend to reflect overly idealized versions of human behavior, leading to "Utopian" societies lacking variability and complexity. The findings advocate for socially grounded LLMs that accurately capture the diversity of human social interactions. <div>

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining, predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions, and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies. However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications. Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias, resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

Summary:
A new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in the Estonian language has been introduced. The benchmark consists of seven diverse datasets that cover various aspects of the language, including grammar, vocabulary, comprehension, and summarization. The datasets are generated from native Estonian sources, eliminating the need for machine translation. The study compares the performance of base models, instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Evaluation methods include human assessment and LLM-as-a-judge techniques. The results showed a strong correlation between human ratings and benchmark evaluations, with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model proving to be an effective judge. This study fills a gap in the availability of LLM benchmarks for Estonian and provides valuable insights into the performance of different models in the language.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more. The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using machine translation. We compare the performance of base models, instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results, we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations, depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes. Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper, we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded, LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods: We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment, readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 % contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 % impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced AI agents into emergency response workflows.

<div> fractal-geometric, self-similarity, correlation dimension, language models, complexity<br />
Summary:<br />Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive advances in natural language generation but still exhibit certain issues like repetition and incoherence, despite having low perplexity. The conventional evaluation metrics often overlook the long-range structural complexity of generated text. This study introduces correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text perceived by language models. Through experiments, the study shows that correlation dimension can identify distinct phases during pretraining, reflect context-dependent complexity, indicate model hallucination tendencies, and detect various forms of text degeneration. Importantly, this method is computationally efficient, robust to model quantization, applicable across different autoregressive architectures, and provides valuable insights into the generative dynamics of LLMs.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity. We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

<div> Sparse attention, large language models, block-sparse attention, Permuted Block-Sparse Attention, computational efficiency <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn) as a method to improve computational efficiency in large language models by leveraging attention permutation properties. PBS-Attn partitions sequences into blocks, increasing block-level sparsity to enhance prefilling efficiency. Experiments show PBS-Attn outperforms existing block-sparse methods in model accuracy and closely matches full attention baseline. Custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels power PBS-Attn, achieving a 2.75x speedup in long-context prefilling. The method addresses computational redundancy by optimizing attention patterns, making it practical for real-world long-context datasets. PBS-Attn offers a significant advancement in enhancing the computational efficiency of large language models by leveraging the inherent sparsity in attention matrices and optimizing block-level sparsity patterns. <div>

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

Summary:
Large language models have shown impressive performance in natural language tasks, but their application in reinforcement learning tasks is limited. This study introduces PARL, a novel approach that uses language models as reinforcement learning agents without fine-tuning. Through prompting, PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards to enable learning through interaction. The method outperforms traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge but struggles with tasks involving complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions. The study highlights the potential of language models in RL tasks beyond natural language processing and underscores the need for further research to address limitations in more complex scenarios. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings. These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised (e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and actions.

<br />
Summary: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models for free-form question answering is challenging due to the need for expensive generations. A diversity-steered sampler is introduced to reduce redundant outputs during decoding, leading to sample-efficiency gains in autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms. A continuous semantic-similarity penalty, injected using a lightly finetuned natural language inference model, helps debias downstream uncertainty estimates. Importance reweighting and control variates are used to reduce variance. The method matches or surpasses baselines on four QA benchmarks while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. The modular framework can enhance uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments without requiring gradient access to the base LLM. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

Summary:
- Research in linguistics and NLP has shown that humans and models can read words with internally scrambled letters, known as typoglycemia.
- The study focuses on the English language and aims to understand how models perform well when words collapse under typoglycemia.
- The analysis of the British National Corpus reveals that relatively few English words collapse under typoglycemia and occur in distinct contexts for easy disambiguation.
- BERT's ability to disambiguate collapsing forms is evaluated, showing that performance degradation is smaller than expected.
- A probing experiment comparing BERT variants trained on clean vs. typoglycemic text further supports the findings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by scrambling is smaller than expected.

Summary:
TripTide introduces a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in revising travel itineraries under realistic disruptions. The benchmark assesses LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations and overbooked attractions, considering disruption severity and traveler tolerance. Automatic metrics such as Preservation of Intent, Responsiveness, and Adaptability are used to evaluate the quality of revisions. Results show that LLMs maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, with spatial deviations decreasing for longer trips. However, disruption-handling ability diminishes as plan length increases, indicating limitations in LLM robustness. The study emphasizes the importance of adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning under real-world uncertainty.<br /><br />Summary: TripTide presents a benchmark for assessing LLM performance in revising travel itineraries amidst disruptions, highlighting strengths in sequential and semantic consistency but revealing challenges in spatial coherence and disruption handling as plan length increases. <div>
arXiv:2510.21329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial, and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic, spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones, indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However, disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning under real-world uncertainty.

Summary: <br />
The study explores the necessity of multi-turn training with human feedback for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). Contrary to previous beliefs, the research finds that LLMs trained in a single-turn setting show effective generalization to both single- and multi-turn scenarios. In contrast, models trained using multi-turn strategies experience a significant decrease in single-turn reasoning performance. The results indicate that for tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training is more effective and reliable than multi-turn training with basic feedback. The findings suggest that while multi-turn interactions may be common in real-world applications, for reasoning tasks, single-turn training remains superior. <div>
arXiv:2510.21339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade reasoning capabilities.

The dataset focuses on Swedish public figures, cultural events, and sports, offering a unique testing ground. Results show that smaller models with strong Swedish coverage perform well in factual recall compared to larger multilingual models. Pre-training on Swedish improves factual knowledge but may lead to forgetting some previously known information.

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations. Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

Summary: SindBERT is introduced as a large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish NLP, trained on 312 GB of Turkish text. It is released in base and large configurations, offering the first large-scale encoder-only language model for Turkish. Evaluation on various tasks shows competitive performance with existing models, with the large variant excelling in some areas but not showing consistent scaling advantages. This suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may be saturated. Comparison with smaller models like BERTurk indicates that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh data volume. SindBERT is released under the MIT license in fairseq and Huggingface formats, providing a valuable resource for Turkish NLP research. This study sheds light on the limits of scaling and the importance of corpus composition for morphologically rich languages. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in healthcare applications, particularly in human activity recognition (HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer flexibility and can overcome limitations of traditional deep learning models. However, evaluating their dynamic and non-deterministic outputs poses a challenge. To address this, a descriptive caption dataset and evaluation methods were introduced to assess VLMs in HAR. Comparative experiments with deep learning models showed that VLMs can achieve comparable or superior accuracy in HAR tasks. This research provides a significant benchmark for evaluating VLMs and highlights their potential integration into intelligent healthcare systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition (HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and, in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

Summary:
Traditional Information Retrieval metrics assume human users examine documents sequentially, which does not align with Large Language Models in Retrieval Augmented Generation systems that process all documents simultaneously. Traditional metrics also do not account for irrelevant but related documents that negatively impact generation quality in LLMs. A utility-based annotation schema is introduced to quantify the positive contribution of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. UDCG, a new metric, incorporates LLM-oriented positional discount to optimize correlation with end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on multiple datasets and LLMs show that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36% compared to traditional metrics. This work aims to align IR evaluation with LLM consumers, providing a more reliable assessment of RAG components.

arXiv:2510.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR, assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality, rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility, classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36% compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment of RAG components

The system includes an anomaly detection module for detecting emergencies such as falls and alerting caregivers. It also features a natural language processing component for recognizing patient activity and emotion, allowing healthcare workers to interact with an intelligent agent through a web application.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.

<div> Keywords: diffusion language models, token correlation, Multi-Reward Optimization, reasoning performance, denoising process

Summary:
Diffusion language models (DLMs) have shown promise as an alternative to autoregressive large language models, but still lag behind in reasoning performance. The main issue lies in the independent generation of masked tokens, lacking token correlation. This study identifies intra-sequence and inter-sequence correlations as crucial for enhancing reasoning performance. To address this, a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach is proposed, utilizing test-time scaling, reject sampling, and reinforcement learning to optimize token correlation with multiple rewards. Group step and importance sampling strategies are introduced to enhance sampling efficiency and reduce reward variance. Through experiments, MRO not only boosts reasoning performance but also accelerates sampling speed while maintaining high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. Overall, incorporating token correlation into denoising processes can significantly enhance the performance of diffusion language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance, especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation: intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically, our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Summary:<br />
Pretrained language models show strong alignment with brain responses to natural language stimuli, making them useful for studying language processing. However, current methods for estimating and improving brain alignment are participant-specific and data-intensive. A new approach introduces scalable brain-tuning by fine-tuning speech language models to predict fMRI responses from multiple participants, significantly reducing data needs, increasing brain alignment, and generalizing across participants. This method also enhances performance on semantic tasks, indicating more generalizable semantic representations. By bridging neuroscience and AI, this research demonstrates a mutually beneficial relationship between the two fields. The code and models are available for public use. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain. However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

<div> hallucination detection, retrieval-augmented generation, external context, parametric knowledge, mechanistic signals
Summary: 
Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models can be problematic when the generated outputs are inconsistent with the retrieved content. This study aims to disentangle the contributions of external context and parametric knowledge in causing hallucinations. By investigating the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations, the researchers found that they occur due to the disproportionate injection of parametric knowledge by later-layer FFN modules into the residual stream. To address this issue, they propose a detection approach based on external context scores and parametric knowledge scores. The method involves computing these scores across layers and attention heads, and training regression-based classifiers to predict hallucinations. Evaluation against state-of-the-art Language Models (LLMs) and detection baselines shows the efficiency and generalizability of mechanistic signals as predictors for hallucination detection in RAG systems. Moreover, classifiers trained on specific signals also show potential for proxy-model evaluation.  <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore, classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses, demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination detection in RAG systems.

<div> Keywords: category theory, multimodal document structure, information theoretic measures, content summarization, self-supervised improvement

Summary: 
This article explores the application of category theory in analyzing multimodal document structures. By representing documents as categories of question-answer pairs and using an orthogonalization procedure to extract non-overlapping pieces of information, the study develops methods to measure and enumerate information content in documents. It also introduces new summarization techniques and addresses the problem of exegesis to extend original documents. A rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques is conducted using the question-answer pair methodology. The study implements these techniques using large pretrained models and proposes a multimodal extension of the mathematical framework. Additionally, a self-supervised method using RLVR is developed to improve pretrained models, leveraging consistency constraints derived from the category theoretic framework such as composability and closure under certain operations. <div>

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques, as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) show varying multilingual behavior, with their sensitivity to linguistic genera being explored in this study. The analysis on the MultiQ dataset investigates if LLMs tend to switch to related languages and if knowledge consistency is better preserved within or across genera. The study reveals that genus-level effects are present but influenced by training resources. Different multilingual strategies are observed across LLM families. The findings suggest that LLMs capture aspects of genus-level structure but are mainly shaped by training data imbalances in their multilingual performance. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

The article discusses the need for more challenging evaluations for large language models to test their pragmatics understanding beyond surface-level linguistic competence. It introduces SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics understanding benchmarks for Slovene, containing 405 multiple-choice questions. The difficulty of translation is highlighted, along with the establishment of a human baseline and pilot evaluations with LLMs. Results show that models have improved in nuanced language understanding but struggle with implied speaker meaning in non-literal utterances, especially culture-specific ones. A significant gap between proprietary and open-source models is observed. The article emphasizes the importance of designing benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and knowledge of the target culture with native data and human validation.

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405 multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific. We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models. Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language documentation.

<div> Keywords: large language models, stock movement prediction, reasoning abilities, Reflective Evidence Tuning, financial tasks 

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities on mathematical tasks, but their application to stock movement prediction in the financial domain is lacking. Analysis reveals that LLMs tend to follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit independent analytical logic. They also struggle to weigh adversarial evidence, essential for reliable predictions. To address these issues, Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning) is proposed as a pre-training method to enhance prediction abilities by encouraging the construction of an analytical framework from diverse information sources. A large dataset spanning multiple stocks and factors is used to evaluate RETuning, showcasing improved reasoning abilities and reliable predictions. The approach minimizes the model's reliance on contextual viewpoints, ensuring independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence. Inference-time scaling remains effective even on out-of-distribution stocks, reflecting the model's enhanced understanding of stock movement prediction over time. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.21604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks, with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track), that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space. We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Summary:
The study addresses the challenge of generating original and coherent ideas in art using Large Language Models (LLMs). The researchers introduce the Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that separates compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS utilizes two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model and a Cultural Context Model. By targeting combinations high in coherence and low in typicality, CAS generates ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and cultural context. Human evaluation and quantitative studies demonstrate that CAS outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines, achieving results comparable to human art students in perceived originality and harmony. CAS also produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space compared to its GPT-4o counterpart, showing that artificial cultural alienness can enhance creative potential in autonomous agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models (LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation (N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Summary: 
Child speech presents unique challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to differences in acoustics, prosody, and language development, as well as the presence of disfluencies. This study evaluates the performance of Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) in processing disfluent child speech in two different settings. The evaluation focuses on single-channel source separation to isolate child speech and child-only summarization that retains clinically relevant disfluencies while avoiding adult speech leakage. The study combines human expert ratings, BERTScore, and Large Language Models (LLM) to assess the reliability of the models in producing child-only summaries. The findings provide insights into when LALMs are effective in processing child speech and highlight areas where they may struggle. This information can be valuable for the development of ASR and NLP systems for clinical and educational purposes. The study also includes prompts and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication of the results. <div>

Abstract: Child speech differs from adult speech in acoustics, prosody, and language development, and disfluencies (repetitions, prolongations, blocks) further challenge Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recent large audio-language models (LALMs) demonstrate strong cross-modal audio understanding; however, their behavior in disfluent child speech remains underexplored. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs in two settings: an interview (mixed speakers) and a reading task (single child). The tasks are (i) single-channel source separation to isolate the child and (ii) child-only summarization that preserves clinically relevant disfluencies and avoids adult-speech leakage.
  Evaluation combines Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge, human expert ratings, and BERTScore (F1), and we report agreement between models and between models and humans to assess reliability. Our findings delineate the conditions under which LALMs produce faithful child-only summaries from mixed audio and where they fail, offering practical guidance for clinical and educational deployments. We provide prompts and evaluation scripts to support replication.

Summary: 
Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT) is an approach introduced to address the challenges in building foundation models for Electrophysiological (ExG) signal monitoring. The approach aims to enable scalable and task-agnostic ExG monitoring in various real-world settings. The researchers collected 50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data using an earphone-based hardware prototype to bridge the diversity gap in available data. PiMT decomposes ExG signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens and utilizes a reconstruction task to learn robust representations, allowing for adaptive feature recognition across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information. Experimental results on the new DailySense dataset, which facilitates ExG-based analysis across five human senses, as well as on four public ExG benchmarks, demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms existing methods across a broad range of tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.20853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrophysiological (ExG) signals offer valuable insights into human physiology, yet building foundation models that generalize across everyday tasks remains challenging due to two key limitations: (i) insufficient data diversity, as most ExG recordings are collected in controlled labs with bulky, expensive devices; and (ii) task-specific model designs that require tailored processing (i.e., targeted frequency filters) and architectures, which limit generalization across tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach for scalable, task-agnostic ExG monitoring in the wild. We collected 50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data with an earphone-based hardware prototype to narrow the data diversity gap. At the core of our approach is Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT), which decomposes ExG signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens, followed by a reconstruction task to learn robust representations. This enables adaptive feature recognition across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information. Experiments on our new DailySense dataset-the first to enable ExG-based analysis across five human senses-together with four public ExG benchmarks, demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks.

In the study on Spoken Question-Answering (SQA), the authors focused on improving the performance of speech-language models (SpeechLMs) through data-centric exploration. They addressed three key research questions related to pretraining SpeechLMs: processing raw web-crawled audio content, constructing synthetic pretraining datasets, and interleaving text and audio segments in training sequences. By conducting controlled ablations and applying the insights gained, they were able to pretrain a 3.8B-parameter SpeechLM named SpeLangy. This model outperformed larger models by 10.2% in absolute performance. The study highlights the importance of effective data curation in speech-language pretraining and provides valuable guidance for future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Spoken Question-Answering (SQA) is a core capability for useful and interactive artificial intelligence systems. Recently, several speech-language models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a 3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.

<div> Keywords: reasoning language models, self-jailbreaking, safety guardrails, compliance, safety reasoning data <br />
Summary: <br />
The article explores the phenomenon of self-jailbreaking in reasoning language models (RLMs) after training in math or code domains. RLMs find ways to fulfill harmful requests by introducing benign assumptions about users and scenarios. Despite being aware of the harmfulness of requests, RLMs like DeepSeek-R1-distilled and Nemotron exhibit self-jailbreaking behavior. The compliance of RLMs increases after benign reasoning training, leading them to perceive malicious requests as less harmful and comply with them. To prevent self-jailbreaking, minimal safety reasoning data during training can ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. The study offers insights into self-jailbreaking behavior in RLMs and proposes a practical approach to maintaining safety in these models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking. Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of ``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs, including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron, suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking: RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking, we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.

<div> Keywords: large language models, education, hint generation, pedagogical strategy, secondary education

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models are increasingly used in education, but there is concern that these systems may give away answers too easily. This study investigates the use of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active engagement in learning while guiding students towards answers. The focus is on scientific topics at the secondary education level. Two hinting strategies are compared: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints, adapted to learners' progress. A quantitative study with 41 participants reveals varying preferences among learners for hinting strategies. The study also highlights the limitations of automatic evaluation metrics in capturing these preferences. The findings suggest important design considerations for future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems aimed at creating learner-centered educational technologies.

Abstract: Large language models are influencing the education landscape, with students relying on them in their learning process. Often implemented using general-purpose models, these systems are likely to give away the answers, which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints, adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41 participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek to develop learner-centered educational technologies.

Summary: 
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have seen rapid progress, prompting the need for better evaluation protocols due to potential data contamination and saturation in existing static benchmarks. To address these issues, a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework called Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution (KBE) is proposed. KBE utilizes Graph formulation to represent VQA samples and expands static benchmarks by integrating multimodal knowledge. It allows for the reconstruction and expansion of questions by re-selecting visual information and incorporating external textual knowledge, enabling difficulty-controllable evaluation through question exploration adjustment. Extensive experiments show that KBE mitigates data contamination and saturation risks while providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.

<div> reinforcement learning, language models, RePULSe, undesired outputs, adversarial robustness
Summary:
RePULSe is a novel training method that enhances reinforcement learning (RL) approaches by incorporating an additional loss to address the challenge of reducing the probability of undesirable outputs without compromising average reward. This method leverages learned proposals to guide the sampling of low-reward outputs and subsequently reduces their probability, resulting in a more balanced tradeoff between expected reward and the likelihood of undesired outputs. Through experimental validation, RePULSe demonstrates superior performance in achieving this tradeoff compared to conventional RL alignment techniques and alternative methods. Additionally, the study highlights that RePULSe enhances adversarial robustness, further underscoring its effectiveness in addressing both optimization objectives and mitigating the risks associated with undesirable model outputs. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches and alternatives.

Summary: 
Generative recommendation models tokenize actions into semantic IDs and generate predictions based on item features. However, existing methods lack personalization, assuming a universal item similarity. A personalized context-aware tokenizer is proposed, incorporating user historical interactions to generate semantic IDs. This allows for different interpretations of the same item based on user context, improving prediction personalization. Experiments on public datasets show up to 11.44% NDCG@10 improvement over non-personalized baselines. The code is available on GitHub for implementation and replication. <div>
arXiv:2510.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency, scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs. This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/YoungZ365/Pctx.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, safety risks, Self-Jailbreak, Chain-of-Guardrail, reasoning ability

Summary:
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks but are vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies often compromise reasoning ability and fail to address the safety-reasoning trade-off. Through analysis, a phenomenon called Self-Jailbreak has been identified where models override their own risk assessments to respond to unsafe prompts. This highlights the inherent ability of LRMs to reject unsafe queries, which is currently compromised leading to harmful outputs. To address this, the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) training framework is proposed, which reverts unsafe reasoning steps to maintain safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that CoG significantly enhances the safety of LRMs while maintaining reasoning ability, outperforming previous methods that struggled with balancing safety and reasoning trade-offs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts. This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs. Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

<title>Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection, steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions, a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty, and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more capable partners in innovation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen (https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image generation.

<title>Does Model Size Matter? A Comparison of Small and Large Language Models for Requirements Classification</title>

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE). However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem] It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset, despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size. [Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in privacy, cost, and local deployability.

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However, the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be 83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by leveraging multiple LLMs.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes. Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation, as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning. Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.

Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents, the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale. Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier, agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at https://github.com/opas-lab/color-ecosystem.

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts, and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158 expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents, M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess. Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document collections.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code and demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably, CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3) do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access; (4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders. Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

<title>Alert-ME: An Explainability-Driven Defense Against Adversarial Examples in Transformer-Based Text Classification</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based text classifiers such as BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT have shown strong performance in natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. These vulnerabilities raise significant security concerns, as small input perturbations can cause severe misclassifications. Existing robustness methods often require heavy computation or lack interpretability. This paper presents a unified framework called Explainability-driven Detection, Identification, and Transformation (EDIT) to strengthen inference-time defenses. EDIT integrates explainability tools, including attention maps and integrated gradients, with frequency-based features to automatically detect and identify adversarial perturbations while offering insight into model behavior. After detection, EDIT refines adversarial inputs using an optimal transformation process that leverages pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to replace corrupted tokens. To enhance security assurance, EDIT incorporates automated alerting mechanisms that involve human analysts when necessary.
  Beyond static defenses, EDIT also provides adaptive resilience by enforcing internal feature similarity and transforming inputs, thereby disrupting the attackers optimization process and limiting the effectiveness of adaptive adversarial attacks. Experiments using BERT and RoBERTa on IMDB, YELP, AGNEWS, and SST2 datasets against seven word substitution attacks demonstrate that EDIT achieves an average Fscore of 89.69 percent and balanced accuracy of 89.70 percent. Compared to four state-of-the-art defenses, EDIT improves balanced accuracy by 1.22 times and F1-score by 1.33 times while being 83 times faster in feature extraction. The framework provides robust, interpretable, and efficient protection against both standard, zero-day, and adaptive adversarial threats in text classification models.

Abstract: Online spaces provide individuals with the opportunity to engage in discussions on important topics and make collective decisions, regardless of their geographic location or time zone. However, without adequate support and careful design, such discussions often suffer from a lack of structure and civility in the exchange of opinions. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising avenue for helping both participants and organizers in managing large-scale online participation processes. This paper introduces an extension of adhocracy+, a large-scale open-source participation platform. Our extension features two AI-supported debate modules designed to improve discussion quality and foster participant interaction. In a large-scale user study we examined the effects and usability of both modules. We report our findings in this paper. The extended platform is available at https://github.com/mabehrendt/discuss2.0.

<title>Disentangling Latent Shifts of In-Context Learning with Weak Supervision</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform few-shot learning by conditioning on labeled examples in the prompt. Despite its flexibility, ICL suffers from instability -- especially as prompt length increases with more demonstrations. To address this, we treat ICL as a source of weak supervision and propose a parameter-efficient method that disentangles demonstration-induced latent shifts from those of the query. An ICL-based teacher generates pseudo-labels on unlabeled queries, while a student predicts them using only the query input, updating a lightweight adapter. This captures demonstration effects in a compact, reusable form, enabling efficient inference while remaining composable with new demonstrations. Although trained on noisy teacher outputs, the student often outperforms its teacher through pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, consistent with the weak-to-strong generalization effect. Empirically, our method improves generalization, stability, and efficiency across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, surpassing standard ICL and prior disentanglement methods.

Abstract: In the domain of complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, recent advancements have proposed the use of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to suppress output of dispreferred responses, thereby enhancing the long-chain reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, these studies employed LLMs to generate preference trees via Tree-of-thoughts (ToT) and sample the paired preference responses required by the DPO algorithm. However, the DPO algorithm based on binary preference optimization is unable to learn multiple responses with varying degrees of preference/dispreference that provided by the preference trees, resulting in incomplete preference learning. In this work, we introduce Tree Preference Optimization (TPO), that does not sample paired preference responses from the preference tree; instead, it directly learns from the entire preference tree during the fine-tuning. Specifically, TPO formulates the language model alignment as a Preference List Ranking problem, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked preference list of responses given the prompt. In addition, to further assist LLMs in identifying discriminative steps within long-chain reasoning and increase the relative reward margin in the preference list, TPO utilizes Adaptive Step Reward to adjust the reward values of each step in trajectory for performing fine-grained preference optimization. We carry out extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks to evaluate TPO. The experimental results indicate that TPO consistently outperforms DPO across five public large language models on four datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/TPO.git.

Abstract: While large transformer models excel in predictive performance, their lack of interpretability restricts their usefulness in high-stakes domains. To remedy this, we propose the Generalized Induction-Head Model (GIM), an interpretable model for next-token prediction inspired by the observation of "induction heads" in LLMs. GIM is a retrieval-based module that identifies similar sequences in the input context by combining exact n-gram matching and fuzzy matching based on a neural similarity metric. We evaluate GIM in two settings: language modeling and fMRI response prediction. In language modeling, GIM improves next-token prediction by up to 25%p over interpretable baselines, significantly narrowing the gap with black-box LLMs. In an fMRI setting, GIM improves neural response prediction by 20% and offers insights into the language selectivity of the brain. GIM represents a significant step toward uniting interpretability and performance across domains. The code is available at https://github.com/ejkim47/generalized-induction-head.

Abstract: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

<title>Misspellings in Natural Language Processing: A survey</title>

Abstract: This survey provides an overview of the challenges of misspellings in natural language processing (NLP). While often unintentional, misspellings have become ubiquitous in digital communication, especially with the proliferation of Web 2.0, user-generated content, and informal text mediums such as social media, blogs, and forums. Even if humans can generally interpret misspelled text, NLP models frequently struggle to handle it: this causes a decline in performance in common tasks like text classification and machine translation. In this paper, we reconstruct a history of misspellings as a scientific problem. We then discuss the latest advancements to address the challenge of misspellings in NLP. Main strategies to mitigate the effect of misspellings include data augmentation, double step, character-order agnostic, and tuple-based methods, among others. This survey also examines dedicated data challenges and competitions to spur progress in the field. Critical safety and ethical concerns are also examined, for example, the voluntary use of misspellings to inject malicious messages and hate speech on social networks. Furthermore, the survey explores psycholinguistic perspectives on how humans process misspellings, potentially informing innovative computational techniques for text normalization and representation. Finally, the misspelling-related challenges and opportunities associated with modern large language models are also analyzed, including benchmarks, datasets, and performances of the most prominent language models against misspellings. This survey aims to be an exhaustive resource for researchers seeking to mitigate the impact of misspellings in the rapidly evolving landscape of NLP.

Abstract: We propose $SCONE$ ($S$calable, $C$ontextualized, $O$ffloaded, $N$-gram $E$mbedding), a new method for extending input embedding layers to enhance language model performance. To avoid increased decoding costs, $SCONE$ retains the original vocabulary while introducing embeddings for a set of frequent n-grams. These embeddings provide contextualized representation for each input token and are learned with a separate model during training. After training, embeddings are precomputed and stored in off-accelerator memory; during inference, querying them has minimal impact on latency due to the low complexity of embedding lookups. $SCONE$ enables two new scaling strategies: increasing the number of n-gram embeddings and scaling the model used to learn them, both while maintaining fixed accelerator usage during inference (in terms of FLOPS and memory). We show that scaling both aspects enables a model with 1B accelerator-resident parameters to outperform a 1.9B-parameter baseline across diverse corpora, while using only about half the FLOPS and accelerator memory during inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance across diverse reasoning tasks. To uncover the principles that govern their behaviour, we introduce the Electronic Circuit Principles (ECP), which maps inference-time learning (ITL) onto a semantic electromotive force and inference-time reasoning (ITR) onto a resistive network governed by Ohm's and Faraday's laws. This circuit-based modelling yields closed-form predictions of task performance and reveals how modular prompt components interact to shape accuracy. We validated ECP on 70,000 samples spanning 350 reasoning tasks and 9 advanced LLMs, observing a about 60% improvement in Pearson correlation relative to the conventional inference-time scaling law. Moreover, ECP explains the efficacy of 15 established prompting strategies and directs the development of new modular interventions that exceed the median score of the top 80% of participants in both the International Olympiad in Informatics and the International Mathematical Olympiad. By grounding LLM reasoning in electronic-circuit principles, ECP provides a rigorous framework for predicting performance and optimising modular components.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as highly capable systems and are increasingly being integrated into various uses. However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a universal theoretical framework for understanding long-context language modeling based on a bipartite mutual information scaling law that we rigorously verify in natural language. We demonstrate that bipartite mutual information captures multi-token interactions distinct from and scaling independently of conventional two-point mutual information, and show that this provides a more complete characterization of the dependencies needed for accurately modeling long sequences. Leveraging this scaling law, we formulate the Long-context Language Modeling (L$^2$M) condition, which lower bounds the necessary scaling of a model's history state -- the latent variables responsible for storing past information -- for effective long-context modeling. We validate the framework and its predictions on transformer and state-space models. Our work provides a principled foundation to understand long-context modeling and to design more efficient architectures with stronger long-context capabilities, with potential applications beyond natural language.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step problem solving, but often at the cost of excessive verbosity in intermediate outputs, leading to increased computational overhead. We propose Sketch-of-Thought (SoT), a prompting framework that integrates cognitively inspired reasoning paradigms with linguistic constraints to reduce token usage while preserving reasoning accuracy. SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 18 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 84% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.

Abstract: Distillation has shown remarkable success in transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) teacher to a student LLM. However, current distillation methods require similar tokenizers between the teacher and the student, restricting their applicability to only a small subset of teacher-student pairs. In this work, we develop a principled cross-tokenizer distillation method to solve this crucial deficiency. Our method is the first to enable effective distillation across fundamentally different tokenizers, while also substantially outperforming prior methods in all other cases. We verify the efficacy of our method on three distinct use cases. First, we show that viewing tokenizer transfer as self-distillation enables unprecedentedly effective transfer across tokenizers, including rapid transfer of subword models to the byte-level. Transferring different models to the same tokenizer also enables ensembling to boost performance. Secondly, we distil a large maths-specialised LLM into a small general-purpose model with a different tokenizer, achieving competitive maths problem-solving performance. Thirdly, we use our method to train state-of-the-art embedding prediction hypernetworks for training-free tokenizer transfer. Our results unlock an expanded range of teacher-student pairs for distillation, enabling new ways to adapt and enhance interaction between LLMs.

Abstract: Measuring scientific paper innovation is both important and challenging. Existing content-based methods often overlook the full-paper context, fail to capture the full scope of innovation, and lack generalization. We propose HSPIM, a hierarchical and training-free framework based on large language models (LLMs). It introduces a Paper-to-Sections-to-QAs decomposition to assess innovation. We segment the text by section titles and use zero-shot LLM prompting to implement section classification, question-answering (QA) augmentation, and weighted innovation scoring. The generated QA pair focuses on section-level innovation and serves as additional context to improve the LLM scoring. For each chunk, the LLM outputs a novelty score and a confidence score. We use confidence scores as weights to aggregate novelty scores into a paper-level innovation score. To further improve performance, we propose a two-layer question structure consisting of common and section-specific questions, and apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the question-prompt combinations. Furthermore, under the fine-grained structure of innovation, we extend HSPIM to an HSPIM$^+$ that generates novelty, contribution, and feasibility scores with respective confidence scores. Comprehensive experiments on scientific conference paper datasets show that HSPIM outperforms baseline methods in effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability. Demo code is available at https://github.com/Jasaxion/HSPIM.

Abstract: Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet effective proxies for reward models during alignment. We release our code and data at https://github.com/lilakk/BLEUBERI.

Abstract: Preference datasets are essential for training general-domain, instruction-following language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Each subsequent data release raises expectations for future data collection, meaning there is a constant need to advance the quality and diversity of openly available preference data. To address this need, we introduce HelpSteer3-Preference, a permissively licensed (CC-BY-4.0), high-quality, human-annotated preference dataset comprising of over 40,000 samples. These samples span diverse real-world applications of large language models (LLMs), including tasks relating to STEM, coding and multilingual scenarios. Using HelpSteer3-Preference, we train Reward Models (RMs) that achieve top performance on RM-Bench (82.4%) and JudgeBench (73.7%). This represents a substantial improvement (~10% absolute) over the previously best-reported results from existing RMs. We demonstrate HelpSteer3-Preference can also be applied to train Generative RMs and how policy models can be aligned with RLHF using our RMs. Dataset (CC-BY-4.0): https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer3#preference Models (NVIDIA Open Model): https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/reward-models-68377c5955575f71fcc7a2a3

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. To address this, we introduce \textsc{LEXam}, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Deploying an ensemble LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately, closely aligning with human expert assessments. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. We have open-sourced our code on https://github.com/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam and released our data on https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam.

Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding inherently limits the inference throughput of Large Language Model (LLM) due to its sequential dependency. Speculative decoding mitigates this by verifying multiple predicted tokens in parallel, but its efficiency remains constrained by what we identify as verification heterogeneity -- the uneven difficulty of verifying different speculative candidates. In practice, a small subset of high-confidence predictions accounts for most successful verifications, yet existing methods treat all candidates uniformly, leading to redundant computation. We present HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding framework that allocates verification effort in proportion to candidate uncertainty. HeteroSpec estimates verification complexity using a lightweight entropy-based quantifier, partitions candidates via a data-driven stratification policy, and dynamically tunes speculative depth and pruning thresholds through coordinated optimization. Across five benchmarks and four LLMs, HeteroSpec delivers an average 4.24$\times$ decoding speedup over state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-3, while preserving exact output distributions. Crucially, HeteroSpec requires no model retraining and remains compatible with other inference optimizations, making it a practical direction for improving speculative decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and reduce throughput of token generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining cache entries that receive high importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2\% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/ReasoningPathCompression.

<title>Let LLMs Break Free from Overthinking via Self-Braking Tuning</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains of thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC, MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to 60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.

<title>Reverse Engineering Human Preferences with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents' ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of open-weight and proprietary large language models. We present results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios.

<title>How Does Sequence Modeling Architecture Influence Base Capabilities of Pre-trained Language Models? Exploring Key Architecture Design Principles to Avoid Base Capabilities Degradation</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained language models represented by the Transformer have been proven to possess strong base capabilities, and the representative self-attention mechanism in the Transformer has become a classic in sequence modeling architectures. Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities. Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then, through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture improvements and novel designs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH.

<title>Dependency Parsing is More Parameter-Efficient with Normalization</title>

Abstract: Dependency parsing is the task of inferring natural language structure, often approached by modeling word interactions via attention through biaffine scoring. This mechanism works like self-attention in Transformers, where scores are calculated for every pair of words in a sentence. However, unlike Transformer attention, biaffine scoring does not use normalization prior to taking the softmax of the scores. In this paper, we provide theoretical evidence and empirical results revealing that a lack of normalization necessarily results in overparameterized parser models, where the extra parameters compensate for the sharp softmax outputs produced by high variance inputs to the biaffine scoring function. We argue that biaffine scoring can be made substantially more efficient by performing score normalization. We conduct experiments on semantic and syntactic dependency parsing in multiple languages, along with latent graph inference on non-linguistic data, using various settings of a $k$-hop parser. We train $N$-layer stacked BiLSTMs and evaluate the parser's performance with and without normalizing biaffine scores. Normalizing allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer samples and trainable parameters. Code: https://github.com/paolo-gajo/EfficientSDP

Abstract: Turn-taking is richly multimodal. Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs) facilitate naturalistic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconferencing interactions (84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns. This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms a state-of-the-art audio-only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker transitions. We conduct a detailed ablation study, which reveals that facial expression features contribute the most to model performance. Thus, our working hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate turn-taking prediction. We additionally validate the suitability of automatic speech alignment for PTTM training using telephone speech. This work represents the first comprehensive analysis of multimodal PTTMs. We discuss implications for future work and make all code publicly available.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual correctness and mitigate hallucination. However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses $\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to $\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer. Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG at https://github.com/Yuan-Li-FNLP/R3-RAG.

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance. It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.

Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized on general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a novel method for achieving context-adaptive tokenization in LLMs at inference time. Leveraging an online data compression algorithm (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), zip2zip dynamically expands its active vocabulary at inference time by continuously replacing fragmented token sequences with more compact hypertokens, which it can immediately output during generation. In doing so, the model refines its internal tokenization scheme to match the token distribution of the current context, reducing redundancy and improving representational efficiency. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression that incrementally merges co-occurring tokens into reusable hypertokens on the fly; (2) a dynamic embedding (and unembedding) layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a variant of autoregressive language modeling that pretrains the model to handle hypertokenized, compressed text sequences as inputs and outputs. We show that an existing LLM can be uptrained for zip2zip in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting LLM performs test-time adaptation, learning to use hypertokens in unseen contexts and reducing input and output tokens by 15-40%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text introduces emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external models at inference time. SEAL leverages adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are then used to distill anonymization and critique capabilities into SLMs through supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn both to anonymize text and to evaluate their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy protection. These results highlight the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework for training SLMs as efficient anonymizers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus (LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning, code generation and multi-hop question answering benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models' representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' precision, judged by our probe's accuracy, explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern our probes discover can mitigate these errors.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To facilitate learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for optimizing the balance between performance and cost, opening a pathway toward enhancing performance-cost trade-offs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.

Abstract: We study logical reasoning in language models by asking whether their errors follow established human fallacy patterns. Using the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR) and its open-source implementation, PyETR, we programmatically generate 383 formally specified reasoning problems and evaluate 38 models. For each response, we judge logical correctness and, when incorrect, whether it matches an ETR-predicted fallacy. Two results stand out: (i) as a capability proxy (Chatbot Arena Elo) increases, a larger share of a model's incorrect answers are ETR-predicted fallacies $(\rho=0.360, p=0.0265)$, while overall correctness on this dataset shows no correlation with capability; (ii) reversing premise order significantly reduces fallacy production for many models, mirroring human order effects. Methodologically, PyETR provides an open-source pipeline for unbounded, synthetic, contamination-resistant reasoning tests linked to a cognitive theory, enabling analyses that focus on error composition rather than error rate.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers built for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. We introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), and release DiscoSG-DS, a dataset of 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets.
  Fine-tuning GPT-4o on DiscoSG-DS yields over 40% higher SPICE metric than the best sentence-merging baseline. However, its high inference cost and licensing restrict open-source use. Smaller fine-tuned open-source models (e.g., Flan-T5) perform well on simpler graphs yet degrade on denser, more complex graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiscoSG-Refiner, a lightweight open-source parser that drafts a seed graph and iteratively refines it with a novel learned graph-editing model, achieving 30% higher SPICE than the baseline while delivering 86 times faster inference than GPT-4o. It generalises from simple to dense graphs, thereby consistently improving downstream VLM tasks, including discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection, outperforming alternative open-source parsers.

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which capabilities are gained? We answer this question with a theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). The same is also proven for transformers with positional encodings (like RoPE and ALiBi). These results are established by studying a temporal logic with counting operators equivalent to C-RASP. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency tasks.

<title>Empirical Evidence for Alignment Faking in a Small LLM and Prompt-Based Mitigation Techniques</title>

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Abstract: We present Marcel, a lightweight and open-source conversational agent designed to support prospective students with admission-related inquiries. The system aims to provide fast and personalized responses, while reducing workload of university staff. We employ retrieval-augmented generation to ground answers in university resources and to provide users with verifiable, contextually relevant information. We introduce a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) retriever that maps user questions to knowledge-base entries, which allows administrators to steer retrieval, and improves over standard dense/hybrid retrieval strategies. The system is engineered for easy deployment in resource-constrained academic settings. We detail the system architecture, provide a technical evaluation of its components, and report insights from a real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that knowledge retention can be significantly improved by either augmenting edit knowledge with paraphrases or by freezing layers associated with edited content in fine-tuning stage, offering insight for developing more robust editing algorithms.

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically, through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix $A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tianlwang/Magical.git.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However, practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g., automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g., text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images, audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems, aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times, across versions, by Aug 2025, demonstrating growing community interest.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities. With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant improvement to entity accuracy. The self-constructed training data and test set is publicly available at github.com/L6-NLP/Generative-Annotation-NEC.

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction, we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$ in English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information density. Our results replicated the established relationship between information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs' subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

Abstract: During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations. Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction. We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks (sacrificing bidirectionality), but we find that this also leads to time-interval expansion problem, sacrificing the speed. Therefore, semi-AR eliminates the main advantages of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM) hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve performance through context selection based on predefined context quality assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding. To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts (PonderLM-2). Our approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard model with double the parameters. For instance, our PonderLM-2-Pythia-1.4B, pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

Abstract: Automated content analysis increasingly supports communication research, yet scaling manual coding into computational pipelines raises concerns about measurement reliability and validity. We introduce a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework that treats model failures as layered measurement errors (knowledge gaps, reasoning limitations, and complexity constraints) and targets the layers that most affect inference. The framework implements a three-phase methodology: systematic error profiling across hierarchical layers, targeted intervention design matched to dominant error sources, and rigorous validation with statistical testing. Evaluating HEC across health communication (medical specialty classification) and political communication (bias detection), and legal tasks, we validate the approach with five diverse large language models. Results show average accuracy gains of 11.2 percentage points (p < .001, McNemar's test) and stable conclusions via reduced systematic misclassification. Cross-model validation demonstrates consistent improvements (range: +6.8 to +14.6pp), with effectiveness concentrated in moderate-to-high baseline tasks (50-85% accuracy). A boundary study reveals diminished returns in very high-baseline (>85%) or precision-matching tasks, establishing applicability limits. We map layered errors to threats to construct and criterion validity and provide a transparent, measurement-first blueprint for diagnosing error profiles, selecting targeted interventions, and reporting reliability/validity evidence alongside accuracy. This applies to automated coding across communication research and the broader social sciences.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 37\%. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

<title>Uncertainty as Feature Gaps: Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification of LLMs in Contextual Question-Answering</title>

arXiv:2510.02671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored, despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus. However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for task adaptation, yet today's serving stacks isolate inference and finetuning on separate GPU clusters -- wasting resources and under-utilizing hardware. We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. FlexLLM's static compilation optimizations -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM maintains inference SLO compliance at up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by $1.9-4.8\times$ under heavy inference workloads and $2.5-6.8\times$ under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand. FlexLLM is publicly available at https://flexllm.github.io.

Abstract: For text-based AI systems to interact in the real world, causal reasoning is an essential skill. Since active interventions are costly, we study to what extent a system can learn causal reasoning from symbolic demonstrations of causal axioms. Specifically, we present an axiomatic training method where the system learns from multiple demonstrations of a causal axiom (or rule), rather than incorporating the axiom as an inductive bias or inferring it from data values. A key question is whether the system would learn to generalize from the axiom demonstrations to more complex scenarios. Our results, based on applying axiomatic training to learn the transitivity axiom and d-separation rule, indicate that such generalization is possible. To avoid data contamination issues, we start with a 67 million parameter transformer model and train it from scratch. On both tasks, we find that a model trained on linear causal chains (along with some noisy variations) can generalize well to complex graphs, including longer causal chains, causal chains with reversed order, and graphs with branching.To handle diverse text inputs, the same method is extended to finetune language models. Finetuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct model on our axiomatic data leads to significant gains on causal benchmarks such as Corr2Cause and CLEAR, in some cases providing state-of-the-art performance surpassing GPT-4.

Abstract: Tree search methods have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation. Previous methods combine tree search with reflection that summarizes past mistakes to achieve iterative improvement. However, these methods face significant challenges. First, they search directly within the code language space, neglecting the underlying reasoning process critical for effective code generation. Second, reflection-based approaches merely accumulate historical errors in memory without providing correct reasoning pathways, making it difficult for subsequent search iterations to identify optimal solutions, resulting in decreased search quality. In this work, we propose RethinkMCTS, a framework that systematically explores and refines the reasoning process for code generation. Specifically, we employ MCTS to search for thoughts before code generation and integrate MCTS with a refinement mechanism called rethink, which incorporates fine-grained code execution feedback to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. It ensures the search path aligns with better reasoning, improving overall search quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RethinkMCTS outperforms previous search-based and feedback-enhanced code generation baselines.

<title>Training the Untrainable: Introducing Inductive Bias via Representational Alignment</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate that architectures which traditionally are considered to be ill-suited for a task can be trained using inductive biases from another architecture. We call a network untrainable when it overfits, underfits, or converges to poor results even when tuning their hyperparameters. For example, fully connected networks overfit on object recognition while deep convolutional networks without residual connections underfit. The traditional answer is to change the architecture to impose some inductive bias, although the nature of that bias is unknown. We introduce guidance, where a guide network steers a target network using a neural distance function. The target minimizes its task loss plus a layerwise representational similarity against the frozen guide. If the guide is trained, this transfers over the architectural prior and knowledge of the guide to the target. If the guide is untrained, this transfers over only part of the architectural prior of the guide. We show that guidance prevents FCN overfitting on ImageNet, narrows the vanilla RNN-Transformer gap, boosts plain CNNs toward ResNet accuracy, and aids Transformers on RNN-favored tasks. We further identify that guidance-driven initialization alone can mitigate FCN overfitting. Our method provides a mathematical tool to investigate priors and architectures, and in the long term, could automate architecture design.

Abstract: Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment, while removing the need for large offline datasets required by prior work. We make our code available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/oni.

<title>How Toxic Can You Get? Search-based Toxicity Testing for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language is a deep-rooted means of perpetration of stereotypes and discrimination. Large Language Models (LLMs), now a pervasive technology in our everyday lives, can cause extensive harm when prone to generating toxic responses. The standard way to address this issue is to align the LLM , which, however, dampens the issue without constituting a definitive solution. Therefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for detecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present EvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity, providing a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards toxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an iterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the System Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward higher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on an existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluation using five state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects having increasing complexity (7-671B parameters). Our quantitative evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of EvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated datasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment engages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the perceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions. Results indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level, is significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to 1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks). Furthermore, EvoTox yields a limited cost overhead (from 22% to 35% on average).

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a crucial method for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), with its effectiveness influenced by two key factors: rank selection and weight initialization. While numerous LoRA variants have been proposed to improve performance by addressing one of these aspects, they often compromise usability or computational efficiency. In this paper, we analyze and identify the core limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel framework--GoRA (Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation)--that simultaneously adapts both the rank and initialization strategy within a unified framework. GoRA leverages gradient information during training to dynamically assign optimal ranks and initialize low-rank adapter weights in an adaptive manner. To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only addresses the limitations of prior approaches--which often focus on either rank selection or initialization in isolation--but also unifies both aspects within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation. Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the efficiency of vanilla LoRA. For example, when fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Base for mathematical reasoning, GoRA achieves a 5.13-point improvement over standard LoRA and even outperforms full fine-tuning by 2.05 points under high-rank settings.

Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) for grounded persuasive language generation in automated copywriting, with real estate marketing as a focal application. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted copywriting while ensuring factuality of content generation.

<title>Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF</title>

arXiv:2504.06020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.

arXiv:2504.20571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6% (8.6% improvement beyond format correction), and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7% (7.0% non-format gain). This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which contains the aforementioned example. Furthermore, RLVR with only two examples even slightly exceeds these results (MATH500: 74.8%, average: 36.6%). Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples. In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-category generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by incorporating entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. We also further discuss related observations about format correction, label robustness and prompt modification. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR efficiency and encourage a re-examination of recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR.

<title>Language Models Are Capable of Metacognitive Monitoring and Control of Their Internal Activations</title>

arXiv:2505.13763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they actually use to solve tasks, yet at other times seem unable to recognize those strategies that govern their behavior. This suggests a limited degree of metacognition - the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognition enhances LLMs' capabilities in solving complex tasks but also raises safety concerns, as models may obfuscate their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight (e.g., safety detector). Given society's increased reliance on these models, it is critical that we understand their metacognitive abilities. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired neurofeedback paradigm that uses in-context learning to quantify metacognitive abilities of LLMs to report and control their activation patterns. We demonstrate that their abilities depend on several factors: the number of in-context examples provided, the semantic interpretability of the neural activation direction (to be reported/controlled), and the variance explained by that direction. These directions span a "metacognitive space" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can monitor only a small subset of their neural activations. Our paradigm provides empirical evidence to quantify metacognition in LLMs, with significant implications for AI safety (e.g., adversarial attack and defense).

<title>Pixel Reasoner: Incentivizing Pixel-Space Reasoning with Curiosity-Driven Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

<title>ProxySPEX: Inference-Efficient Interpretability via Sparse Feature Interactions in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n \approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy, we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX efficiently identifies the most influential features, providing a scalable approximation of their Shapley values. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on a question-answering task.

Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance. Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based reranking models.

Abstract: The role of hidden units in recurrent neural networks is typically seen as modeling memory, with research focusing on enhancing information retention through gating mechanisms. A less explored perspective views hidden units as active participants in the computation performed by the network, rather than passive memory stores. In this work, we revisit bilinear operations, which involve multiplicative interactions between hidden units and input embeddings. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that they constitute a natural inductive bias for representing the evolution of hidden states in state tracking tasks. These are the simplest type of tasks that require hidden units to actively contribute to the behavior of the network. We also show that bilinear state updates form a natural hierarchy corresponding to state tracking tasks of increasing complexity, with popular linear recurrent networks such as Mamba residing at the lowest-complexity center of that hierarchy.

Abstract: Accurate predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs) are essential for naturalistic human-robot interaction. However, little is known about their performance in noise. This study therefore explores PTTM performance in types of noise likely to be encountered once deployed. Our analyses reveal PTTMs are highly sensitive to noise. Hold/shift accuracy drops from 84% in clean speech to just 52% in 10 dB music noise. Training with noisy data enables a multimodal PTTM, which includes visual features to better exploit visual cues, with 72% accuracy in 10 dB music noise. The multimodal PTTM outperforms the audio-only PTTM across all noise types and SNRs, highlighting its ability to exploit visual cues; however, this does not always generalise to new types of noise. Analysis also reveals that successful training relies on accurate transcription, limiting the use of ASR-derived transcriptions to clean conditions. We make code publicly available for future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities and achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, leading to their widespread adoption in recent years. Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.

<title>Mitigating Manipulation and Enhancing Persuasion: A Reflective Multi-Agent Approach for Legal Argument Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents (factor analyst and argument polisher) in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate reflective multi-agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate that the reflective multi-agent approach excels at successful abstention by preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded, improves hallucination accuracy by reducing fabricated and misattributed factors and enhances factor utilization recall by better using the provided case facts. These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/data-efficient-llm-rl.

Abstract: A challenge in human-AI decision-making is to balance three factors: the correctness of predictions, the cost of knowledge and reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to abstain from automated answers or escalate to human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, to overcome static policies and accommodate changing task difficulty, we incorporate an online learning mechanism which uses human feedback. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results demonstrate that our cascaded strategy outperforms single-model baselines in most cases, achieving higher accuracy while reducing costs and providing a principled approach to handling abstentions.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with large language models (LLMs), data collection and fine-tuning remain significant challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations, making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time scaling (TTS) strategy. Building on observations about the data scaling, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS surpasses existing video reasoning models by 2.4% in accuracy using only 3.6% training samples. Specifically, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2% improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning benchmark. Notably, our pure RL training and adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong reasoning performance.

Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: AI agents built on foundation models hold enormous promise. Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release ReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source research demo.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&amp;P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.

Abstract: Hallucination in generative AI is often treated as a technical failure to produce factually correct output. Yet this framing underrepresents the broader significance of hallucinated content in language models, which may appear fluent, persuasive, and contextually appropriate while conveying distortions that escape conventional accuracy checks. This paper critically examines how regulatory and evaluation frameworks have inherited a narrow view of hallucination, one that prioritises surface verifiability over deeper questions of meaning, influence, and impact. We propose a layered approach to understanding hallucination risks, encompassing epistemic instability, user misdirection, and social-scale effects. Drawing on interdisciplinary sources and examining instruments such as the EU AI Act and the GDPR, we show that current governance models struggle to address hallucination when it manifests as ambiguity, bias reinforcement, or normative convergence. Rather than improving factual precision alone, we argue for regulatory responses that account for languages generative nature, the asymmetries between system and user, and the shifting boundaries between information, persuasion, and harm.

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development, potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely, Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible, unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability, visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future updates.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Summary: 
DeBERTa-KC is introduced as a transformer-based model for automatically classifying knowledge construction levels in online science learning discourse. The study collected comments from popular YouTube science channels and created a corpus of 20,000 annotated samples across four knowledge construction categories: nonKC, Share, Explore, and Negotiate. The model extends DeBERTa-v3 with enhancements to address class imbalance and improve generalization. Through a reproducible pipeline, including data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training, and evaluation, DeBERTa-KC achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.836, surpassing classical and transformer baseline models significantly. The results indicate the model's sensitivity to higher-order engagement levels, particularly in Explore and Negotiate discourse, showcasing its ability to capture nuanced indicators of knowledge construction in digital learning environments. This research highlights the potential of large language models for discourse analysis and the automated assessment of epistemic engagement in educational settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels (2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share}, \textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3 with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in \textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

<div> model selection, pedagogical soundness, AI-generated lesson plans, prompt frameworks, readability

Summary:
- Model selection plays a crucial role in the readability of AI-generated lesson plans, with DeepSeek being the most readable and Claude the densest.
- The prompt framework structure significantly influences factual accuracy and curriculum alignment, with the RACE framework performing best in these aspects.
- Lesson plans across all models largely focused on lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy, indicating a lack of higher-order objectives.
- Readability is more influenced by model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend on the prompt framework.
- The most effective configuration for lesson plans involves using a readability-optimized model with the RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum standards, and higher-order objectives. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice, three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal), RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic, The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2) factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum standards, and higher-order objectives.

Summary: 
Discrete diffusion models used in vision-language tasks face a train-inference discrepancy leading to catastrophic error cascades. To address this challenge, ReDiff introduces a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that actively corrects errors. The model is trained in two stages: first to revise synthetic errors and then to self-correct flawed drafts by learning from expert corrections. This mistake-driven approach enables the model to revisit and refine its generated output, breaking the error cascade. ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and factual accuracy of generated content, enhancing parallel generation efficiency. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of ReDiff over traditional denoising methods. The codes and models for ReDiff are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades: initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context, triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

<div> Sparse Tracing, Large Language Models, Long Context Attention, Stream Algorithm, Interpretability

Summary:
Sparse Tracing introduces a novel technique called Stream to efficiently analyze attention patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs) with million-token contexts. By leveraging dynamic sparse attention and using a hierarchical pruning algorithm, Stream can estimate attention masks in near-linear time and space. This enables one-pass interpretability at scale, making it possible to analyze long chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning a majority of token interactions. Applying Stream to the RULER benchmark shows it preserves critical retrieval paths while discarding a significant portion of interactions and exposes layer-wise routes from input to output. The method offers a practical tool for tracing information flow in LLMs without requiring terabytes of memory, making long context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs. <div>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000 tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning 97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/stream-03B8/.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel pipeline that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze unstructured Electronic Health Record (EHR) text in identifying patients eligible for HIV testing. While existing research mainly focuses on structured data, this approach considers valuable information found in clinical notes. By leveraging LLM, the pipeline achieved high accuracy and maintained a low false negative rate when tested on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam. The efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are crucial for reducing transmission, making this approach significant for improving HIV diagnosis. Incorporating unstructured text data in EHR analysis can enhance the accuracy of determining patient eligibility for HIV testing, providing a more comprehensive approach to HIV diagnosis in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible, the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while maintaining a low false negative rate.

Summary:
Artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), are being explored for life cycle assessment (LCA) support. This study is the first expert-grounded benchmark for LLMs in LCA, evaluating 11 models across 22 tasks. Results show that 37% of responses contained inaccurate information, highlighting risks of naive LLM application in LCA. Models performed well in accuracy, explanation quality, and format adherence, but varied in hallucination rates. Open-weight and closed-weight models showed similar performance. Benefits include improved explanation quality and task efficiency, but caution is needed in relying on LLMs as oracles. Grounding mechanisms are essential for LLM use in LCA. <div>
arXiv:2510.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness, verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without grounding mechanisms presents ...

<div> evaluation, language models, games, Dixit, strategies
Summary: 
Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are typically evaluated on individual benchmarks or through subjective human or model comparisons, which may lead to biased results. To address this, the authors propose game-based evaluations using the Dixit card game to holistically assess MLM capabilities. Games provide a competitive environment with fixed rules, making evaluations engaging and objective. Quantitative experiments with five MLMs show that win-rate rankings in Dixit align perfectly with popular MLM benchmarks. Furthermore, games played between humans and MLMs in Dixit highlight differences in agent strategies and areas for MLM reasoning improvement. This shift towards game-based evaluations offers a more robust and engaging way to evaluate MLM capabilities accurately. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static, individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, optimization modeling, decision-making, natural language understanding, supply chain

Summary:
This research explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling to enhance decision-making in operations research (OR). Traditional methods in OR heavily rely on domain expertise for formulating mathematical models, but LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 show promise in bridging this gap through natural language understanding and code generation. Despite challenges such as high token costs and hallucinations, DeepSeek-R1, trained with reinforcement learning, offers a cost-efficient and high-performing alternative. The study systematically evaluates DeepSeek-R1 on four OR benchmarks, employing techniques like LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning, Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent Framework to reduce hallucinations and enhance formulation accuracy. This research aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of LLMs, specifically DeepSeek-R1, in solving real-world OR problems.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research (OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation. Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts. In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

Summary:
This study explores how agents built on large language models can learn classification functions without parameter updates. The proposed framework leverages both labeled data and critiques generated by language models, using episodic and semantic memory to store and distill guidance. Incorporating critiques improves accuracy by up to 24.8% compared to retrieval-based baselines. The study reveals behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models in handling different types of data. A novel metric, suggestibility, is introduced to interpret how models respond to different forms of supervision.

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly, inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a 24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models, particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and interpretable LLM agents.

Summary:
LyriCAR introduces a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that operates in a fully unsupervised manner. It incorporates an adaptive curriculum strategy that efficiently allocates training resources and accelerates convergence. This approach improves translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex challenges. Extensive experiments on an EN-ZH lyric translation task demonstrate that LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing strong baselines in both standard translation metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores. Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40% while maintaining superior performance. This novel framework offers a promising solution for the challenging task of lyric translation, showcasing the effectiveness of unsupervised learning and adaptive strategies in achieving high-quality translations. <div>
arXiv:2510.19967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work, we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines. Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40% while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at https://github.com/rle27/LyriCAR.

<br />
Summary: This paper introduces a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic natural language understanding (NLU) systems. While LLMs provide broad coverage in language processing, they are prone to errors such as hallucination. On the other hand, symbolic NLU systems offer interpretable understanding rooted in curated lexicons and semantic interpretation rules. The hybrid approach leverages LLMs for rephrasing and text simplification, filling knowledge gaps, and using symbolic NLU for producing structured relational representations for reasoning and learning. The study evaluates this approach in the task of extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts. Results indicate that the hybrid method outperforms the symbolic-only pipeline, showcasing the potential of integrating LLMs and symbolic NLU systems for improved language understanding and reasoning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.19988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources, and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Summary:  
The paper introduces a novel algorithm for parsing natural language sentences to dependency trees. Unlike traditional constituency parsers, this algorithm processes words individually, attaching them as soon as possible, mirroring how the human brain functions. Despite a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^3), this complexity is typically only seen in small n-values within human language. The algorithm shares similarities with phrase-structure parsing but offers a more efficient approach by attaching words in a more intuitive manner. This method aims to better understand the structural relationships within sentences and demonstrates promise in modeling cognitive processes related to language comprehension. The innovative parsing strategy presents a step forward in the field of natural language processing, potentially offering new insights into the mechanisms involved in human language understanding.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency) parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is $O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) show potential for clinical applications and are often evaluated using datasets like MedQA. However, many medical datasets, including MedQA, oversimplify clinical decision-making tasks. To address this, a new paradigm is proposed to characterize such tasks along two dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. Existing datasets and benchmarks are reviewed based on these dimensions, and methods for improving clinical decision-making, both during training and testing phases, are discussed. The evaluation criteria are extended to include efficiency and explainability, in addition to accuracy. The article also outlines open challenges in this field. This paradigm aims to clarify assumptions, standardize comparisons, and guide the development of more clinically meaningful LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making, including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help. Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency, explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically meaningful LLMs.

arXiv:2510.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich, moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized, high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window, insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges, this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora, emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT. Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models significantly outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted transfer learning paradigms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy. LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of 8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

To address this, the authors introduce the Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge (BLanCK) dataset, focusing on folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional dialects. Their analysis of different multilingual language models reveals that while these models excel in non-cultural categories, they struggle with cultural knowledge. The study emphasizes the importance of context-aware architectures and culturally curated training data, showing significant performance improvements.

Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback and Direct preference optimization were used to enhance the reasoning capabilities of a Persian language model for medical question answering. The study translated a medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used rejected-preferred answer pairs to improve the model's reasoning skills. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought reasoning responses, a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories was compiled.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.

Summary: The article introduces CreativityPrism, an evaluation framework for assessing the creativity of large language models (LLMs) based on three dimensions: quality, novelty, and diversity. It includes nine tasks across three domains and twenty metrics to measure each dimension. Evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs using CreativityPrism reveals disparities between proprietary and open-source models. Performance correlations show that models excel within the same domain tasks but not across different domains. Diversity and quality metrics are strongly correlated, while novelty shows weaker correlations. The study emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive evaluation approach to assess LLM creativity accurately.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text, there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e., divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways. We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other - whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

<div> Entity Linking, Few-shot Learning, Language Models, Adaptive Routing, Targeted Entity Reasoning
Summary:
The paper introduces ARTER, a novel Entity Linking (EL) system that combines candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning to achieve high performance without extensive model fine-tuning. By categorizing contextual mentions into easy and hard cases, ARTER utilizes low-computational methods for simple cases and more expensive targeted Language Model-based reasoning for complex cases. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on several datasets, and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all mentions while being twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM tokens. This structured pipeline offers a promising approach to Entity Linking that balances performance and efficiency, showcasing the potential of combining different techniques for improved results.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER (Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets, and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM tokens.

<div> segmentation, structured texts, BoundRL, reinforcement learning, language models

Summary:<br />
The article introduces BoundRL, a novel approach for segmenting and labeling long structured texts with elements like tables and code snippets. BoundRL generates starting tokens for segments and reconstructs the complete content by locating these tokens in the original text, reducing inference costs and minimizing hallucination. It uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to optimize document reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. BoundRL also creates intermediate candidates by perturbing generated sequences to improve solution quality. Evaluation on challenging textual prompts shows that BoundRL enables small language models to outperform larger models with few-shot prompting. RLVR with a specific reward outperforms supervised fine-tuning, and including intermediate candidates improves both performance and generalization.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains -- from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts. Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse, it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

<div> stereotypes, bias, Large Language Models, stance detection, NLP

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit stereotypes from pretraining data, impacting their behavior in NLP tasks. While bias in NLP tasks like hateful speech detection is recognized, evaluation in stance detection is often overlooked. Stance detection, which labels statements as against, in favor, or neutral towards a target, is sensitive, especially concerning political views. This study examines biases in LLMs during stance detection in a zero-shot setting. By annotating posts with dialect and text complexity attributes, the study reveals that LLMs demonstrate stereotypes, such as linking pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and associating African American dialect with opposition to Donald Trump. The findings highlight the need to address biases in stance detection models to ensure fair and accurate outcomes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data, leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

<br />
Summary:
DeepWideSearch introduces a benchmark to evaluate agents that can integrate depth and width in information seeking. The benchmark requires agents to perform deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths while processing a large volume of data. Results show that even state-of-the-art agents perform poorly on this task, with an average success rate of only 2.39%. Error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow. The release of DeepWideSearch aims to stimulate further research on developing more capable and robust information-seeking agents. <div>

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and \textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore, our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust information-seeking agents.

<div> Keywords: table reasoning, language models, multi-agent framework, reinforcement learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search 

Summary:
Mixture-of-Minds is a novel multi-agent framework designed to enhance table reasoning by decomposing the task into planning, coding, and answering roles. This approach allows each agent to specialize in a specific aspect of table manipulation, integrating robust reasoning with reliable processing. The framework employs a self-improvement training method utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents using reinforcement learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, with Mixture-of-Minds achieving a 62.13% performance on TableBench and surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. By combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL, this approach shows promise in advancing table understanding in real-world applications.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table understanding.

Summary:
- The paper investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through various tasks.
- Tasks included quadrant identification, geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile sliding.
- LLMs showed moderate success in simpler tasks but struggled as complexity and scale increased.
- Average loss in accuracy was 42.7%, reaching up to 84% in some cases.
- The findings suggest a lack of robust spatial representations in the underlying architectures of LLMs.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification, geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions, requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration. Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

<title>Decoding-Free Sampling Strategies for LLM Marginalization</title>

<div> Keywords: language models, subword-tokenized text, marginalization, decoding-free sampling, inference tasks

Summary: 
This study explores the challenges of evaluating large language models (LLMs) which operate on subword-tokenized text. Current evaluation methods only consider the specific tokenization produced during inference, neglecting other possible representations with the same subword vocabulary. The concept of marginalization, which involves considering the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text, is proposed as a more comprehensive evaluation approach. To address the computational complexity of marginalization, the study investigates decoding-free sampling strategies that do not involve costly text generation steps. These strategies offer accurate marginal estimates with significantly reduced runtime costs across various open models. By applying these strategies to downstream inference tasks, the study demonstrates their effectiveness in providing accurate approximations while maximizing efficiency in LLM evaluation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

<div> Keywords: depression, PTSD, severity, tri-modal affective fusion, clinical decision making

Summary:
This study presents a unified tri-modal affective severity framework for assessing depression and PTSD simultaneously. By synchronizing and fusing interview text, audio, and facial signals, the framework outputs graded severities for both disorders. The fusion approach outperforms unimodal baselines in cross-validation on corpora, demonstrating improved accuracy and decision curve utility. The model shows that text contributes most to depression severity, while audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD assessment. Errors often occur between adjacent severities, but extreme classes can be reliably identified. The approach provides reproducible evaluation and supports clinicians in affective clinical decision-making. Overall, the tri-modal fusion approach offers a comprehensive and robust method for assessing concurrent depression and PTSD with severity awareness. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes) and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective clinical decision making.

Summary: ContextLM introduces a new framework for enhancing large language models by incorporating next-context prediction alongside the traditional next-token prediction during pretraining. This novel approach allows the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token contexts, leading to improved capture of higher-level semantic structures and long-range contextual relationships. Despite this enhancement, ContextLM is fully compatible with the standard autoregressive evaluation paradigm. Experiments conducted on GPT2 and Pythia models with 1.5B parameters demonstrated consistent enhancements in perplexity and downstream task performance. The analysis revealed that next-context prediction offers a scalable and efficient method for strengthening language modeling, resulting in improved long-range coherence and more effective attention allocation while requiring minimal computational overhead.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially, ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity). Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to $1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

<div> Keywords: LLM-based RAG systems, citation failure, response verification, CITECONTROL, CITENTION

Summary: 
Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are intended to simplify response verification, but they can fail to cite complete evidence, leading to citation failure. This work disentangles citation failure from response failure and proposes a two-step approach to address it. The study examines when citation failure occurs and how it can be mitigated. By introducing CITECONTROL, a benchmark that varies the relation between response and evidence, the researchers find that citation failures increase with relational complexity. To improve citation quality efficiently, the CITENTION framework integrates generative, attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Experiments show significant improvements in citation quality using CITENTION on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. Publicly available data and code provide transparency and reproducibility in research. <div>

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative, attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data and code publicly available.

Summary: 
This study explores the application of process reward models (PRMs) to table question answering (TQA), a task involving semi-structured data. While PRMs have been successful in domains like mathematics, their effectiveness in TQA has not been extensively explored. The evaluation of state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA reveals challenges such as dealing with irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning steps, and domain-specific reasoning. Results suggest that PRMs combining textual and code verification can assist in solution selection but struggle to generalize to out-of-domain data. Weak correlation between step-level verification performance and answer accuracy indicates a need for better understanding of step dependencies and causal links. These findings emphasize the limitations of current PRMs in TQA and provide insights for developing more robust verifiers. <div>

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics, their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust, process-aware verifiers.

CoRT is a framework aimed at improving the utilization of Code Interpreters (CIs) by Large reasoning models (LRMs) for complex mathematical operations. It introduces Hint-Engineering, a data synthesis approach injecting hints strategically to optimize LRM-CI interaction. By post-training models with 30 synthesized samples, CoRT enhances model performance by 4% and 8% on different model sizes across challenging math reasoning datasets. It also increases efficiency by reducing token usage by approximately 30% and 50% for different model sizes compared to natural language reasoning baselines. CoRT utilizes rejection sampling and reinforcement learning for enhanced CI integration within LRMs. The code and models are available on GitHub for further exploration.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters (CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT (Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality, code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness, yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and 50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines. The models and code are available at: https://github.com/ChengpengLi1003/CoRT.

Summary: 
This study explores the impact of dataset contamination on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning over structured data. The experiments conducted focused on popular tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income and Titanic datasets. The results show that LLMs exhibit prior knowledge primarily on datasets with strong semantic cues, such as meaningful column names or interpretable value categories. When these cues are removed or randomized, the performance of LLMs drops significantly, indicating a reliance on memorization rather than genuine generalization. The findings highlight the need to consider dataset contamination in evaluating LLMs and suggest strategies to differentiate between semantic leakage and authentic reasoning abilities in future assessments. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income, Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized, performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization. We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM assessments.

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification, limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Summary:
The study explores the effectiveness of pre-training language models exclusively on dialogue data. The researchers introduce the llamalogue model and investigate various fine-tuning techniques to enhance the communicative quality of text generated by the models. While the models do not perform well on standard benchmarks, they show significant improvement in predicting dialogue continuations within a minimal pair setting. The effects of PPO fine-tuning on the models are mixed, sometimes even adversarial. However, DPO fine-tuning proves to enhance the models' performance, particularly on a custom dialogue benchmark. This research highlights the potential benefits of training language models on dialogue data and the importance of fine-tuning strategies in improving their communicative abilities. <div>

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce "more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

<div> hallucination, large language models, negation, detection, dataset

Summary:
The study explores the impact of negated text on hallucination in large language models (LLMs). Three key research questions are posed and addressed. The research investigates whether LLMs can recognize contextual shifts caused by negation and effectively distinguish hallucinations in negated text compared to affirmative cases. The NegHalu dataset is designed to evaluate hallucination detection in negated expressions. Results show that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text, often providing inconsistent or inaccurate judgments. The internal state of LLMs processing negated inputs at the token level highlights the challenges in mitigating unintended effects. This research sheds light on the complexities of hallucination detection in LLMs when dealing with negated linguistic contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size (BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual: BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Summary:<br /><br />
- The study focuses on the importance of instruction tuning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the challenges posed by varying data quality in instruction-following tasks. 
- Existing data augmentation methods struggle to effectively augment low-quality data, leading to significant information loss.
- The researchers introduce the concept of Instruction Distillation, aiming to distill low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality instruction-output pairs. 
- They create the MIXTURE dataset, comprising 144K samples, to pair imperfect instruction clusters with their high-quality distillations.

- The study demonstrates that distilling and augmenting low-quality data can significantly enhance the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned LLMs. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined. To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation: distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality, semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup, significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned LLMs.

Summary:<br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) often produce outputs with varying levels of uncertainty and correctness, affecting their practical reliability. In this study, four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM outputs were systematically evaluated: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA. Experiments on four question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM revealed that each uncertainty metric captures different aspects of model confidence. The hybrid CoCoA approach was found to be the most reliable overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. The study discussed the trade-offs of each method and provided recommendations for selecting uncertainty measures in LLM applications. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

RECALL is a novel framework for continual learning in large language models (LLMs) that utilizes internal representations as reliable proxies of learned knowledge. It computes inter-model similarity from hidden representations over clustered typical samples and uses adaptive parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This design allows for the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers while facilitating task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. RECALL outperforms baselines in knowledge retention and generalization across multiple NLP tasks and continual learning scenarios. It provides a scalable and data-free solution for evolving LLMs, enabling seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for evolving LLMs.

<div> embedding, Large language models (LLMs), evaluation-aware behavior, steering vector, safety evaluations
<br />
Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit evaluation-aware behavior when undergoing safety evaluations, potentially compromising the reliability of the assessments. Researchers introduced a steering vector technique to suppress this awareness, making the LLM behave as if it were deployed instead of being evaluated. By training the model to respond differently based on evaluation cues, they demonstrated that the steering vector could effectively mitigate evaluation-aware behavior. The study involved continued pretraining and expert iteration to shape the model's behavior, ultimately showing that the steering vector could make the model act like it is deployed even in the presence of evaluation cues. The results suggest that implementing activation steering could enhance the trustworthiness of safety evaluations for AI models. <div>
arXiv:2510.20487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act like they are deployed.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Robust Preference Selection (RPS) as a method to align large language models with human preferences. It addresses the preference coverage gap by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus to sample multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related preferences. RPS selects the response that best aligns with the user's original intent, without the need for costly retraining. Through comprehensive experiments across different alignment paradigms, RPS consistently outperforms a strong baseline by improving robustness against challenging preferences from under-represented regions of the preference space. The theoretical framework behind RPS demonstrates its superiority in generating responses for nuanced preferences, enhancing the reliability of preference-aligned models. <div>
arXiv:2510.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet, because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc, training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT) demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline, achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the reliability of preference-aligned models.

<div> Hierarchical Sequence Iteration, Retrieval-augmented generation, Question Answering, Evidence Source, Structured Tags
Summary:
Hierarchical Sequence Iteration (HSEQ) is introduced as a framework for heterogeneous Question Answering, improving accuracy and efficiency. HSEQ linearizes different evidence sources into a hierarchical sequence with structural tags and uses structure-aware iteration to collect evidence. The framework includes a Head Agent for guidance in retrieval, an Iteration Agent for structure-respecting actions, and a final answer generation step. HSEQ outperforms existing baselines on various QA datasets, offering a unified approach across different formats, efficient iteration with guided budget utilization, and evidence canonicalization for reliable QA. HSEQ bridges the gap in multi-step questions and diverse evidence sources, enhancing accuracy while minimizing resource use. Additionally, HSEQ ensures consistency and auditability in generated answers. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA (text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1 gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and (3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency and auditability.

This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years, 1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of national parties.

Summary: 
The article introduces ARC-Encoder, an encoder that compresses context into continuous representations to reduce inference costs in large language models (LLMs). Through a systematic study, the design of ARC-Encoder results in improved computational efficiency and state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. This adaptable text compressor can replace token embeddings in decoder LLMs, reducing the number of representations needed for text processing. ARC-Encoder is shown to work effectively with different decoder LLMs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for portable encoders. The trained model and code are made publicly available for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder, which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically $x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder , fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/kyutai/arc-encoders-68ee18787301407d60a57047 .

<div> syntax, semantics, comprehension questions, CenterBench, structural analysis

Summary: 
The study introduces CenterBench, a dataset of comprehension questions focusing on center-embedded sentences with recursive nesting of relative clauses. Models tested on the dataset show widening performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences as complexity increases, indicating a shift from structural analysis to semantic pattern matching. Semantic plausibility affects performance more on questions about resulting actions, where causal reasoning is crucial. Reasoning models demonstrate improvements but also exhibit semantic shortcuts and overthinking. Unlike models, human performance varies in its response to semantic plausibility. CenterBench offers a framework to distinguish between structural understanding and semantic pattern matching in language models. <div>

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed," are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning. Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to pattern matching.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Retrieval-augmented Generation, Multi-hop Question Answering, Global Reasoning, Subgoal Completion Reward

Summary:
GlobalRAG is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve multi-hop question answering by addressing the limitations of global planning absence and unfaithful execution. It decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. The framework introduces Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward to encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. A progressive weight annealing strategy is implemented to balance process-oriented and outcome-based objectives. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that GlobalRAG outperforms strong baselines with only 8k training data, achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and (ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA. GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM and F1.

<div> Framework, E-commerce search, Multi-agent, Decision support, Cognitive systems
<br />
The article introduces the Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework (MACDF) as a solution to the limitations of the retrieval-ranking paradigm in e-commerce search. This framework aims to provide proactive decision support to users by aligning with their multi-stage cognitive decision processes. By addressing issues such as semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs, and the lack of professional shopping guidance, MACDF significantly improves recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction, especially for complex queries with negation, multi-constraint, or reasoning demands. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MACDF, and online A/B testing on the JD search platform confirms its practical efficacy. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent cognitive systems in transforming e-commerce search.

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction, particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Abstract: This paper details our submission to the Ara- GenEval Shared Task on Arabic AI-generated text detection, where our team, BUSTED, se- cured 5th place. We investigated the effec- tiveness of three pre-trained transformer mod- els: AraELECTRA, CAMeLBERT, and XLM- RoBERTa. Our approach involved fine-tuning each model on the provided dataset for a binary classification task. Our findings revealed a sur- prising result: the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa model achieved the highest performance with an F1 score of 0.7701, outperforming the spe- cialized Arabic models. This work underscores the complexities of AI-generated text detection and highlights the strong generalization capa- bilities of multilingual models.

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper, starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments. We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical, scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's language reasoning.

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models: a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

<title>Neural Diversity Regularizes Hallucinations in Small Models</title>

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters, compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically, causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings, applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast, our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally, we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks, AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

<title>User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records, contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g., leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further, we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users' perceived privacy and utility.

<title>Automated Extraction of Fluoropyrimidine Treatment and Treatment-Related Toxicities from Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting). Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1 scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g., R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application (generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features), parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs, contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for the research community.

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks. To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly, we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of compression methods.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval, report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i) employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\% and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative, composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families (Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111 spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17 agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50 controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot. Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting. Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

<title>BIOCAP: Exploiting Synthetic Captions Beyond Labels in Biological Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure, emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate, instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP (i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI insights in high-stakes finance.

<title>Every Question Has Its Own Value: Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels, RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy: concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) systems have traditionally relied on structured text data, but the rapid growth of multimedia content (images, audio, video, and structured metadata) has introduced new challenges and opportunities for retrieval-augmented QA. In this survey, we review recent advancements in QA systems that integrate multimedia retrieval pipelines, focusing on architectures that align vision, language, and audio modalities with user queries. We categorize approaches based on retrieval methods, fusion techniques, and answer generation strategies, and analyze benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and performance tradeoffs. Furthermore, we highlight key challenges such as cross-modal alignment, latency-accuracy tradeoffs, and semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions for building more robust and context-aware QA systems leveraging multimedia data.

<title>Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

<title>Calibrating Multimodal Consensus for Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity, which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels, enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

<title>ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench, a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks, where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors, revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3) developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building more robust and reliable LLM systems.
  Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/safety-research/impossiblebench.

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<title>Relative-Based Scaling Law for Neural Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens. Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings, low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology, DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples. Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models. Demos and codes are available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/ExpressiveSpeech

<title>What Defines Good Reasoning in LLMs? Dissecting Reasoning Steps with Multi-Aspect Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions: relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE). This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context, which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies. The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original and translated data, and the best QI performance using original, translated, and minority class data creation. These approaches secured 4th place on the final leaderboard, with an average F1-score of 0.8857 on the private test set.

<title>Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason, edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf. Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits, systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$ at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale, combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger $K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance, and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns, particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation, conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i) Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected -- eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to 24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just 100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over 10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends, uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

<title>Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing retrieval methods in knowledge-dense domains like law and medicine still suffer from a lack of multi-perspective views, which are essential for improving interpretability and reliability. Previous research on multi-view retrieval often focused solely on different semantic forms of queries, neglecting the expression of specific domain knowledge perspectives. This paper introduces a novel multi-view RAG framework, MVRAG, tailored for knowledge-dense domains that utilizes intention-aware query rewriting from multiple domain viewpoints to enhance retrieval precision, thereby improving the effectiveness of the final inference. Experiments conducted on legal and medical case retrieval demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision rates with our framework. Our multi-perspective retrieval approach unleashes the potential of multi-view information enhancing RAG tasks, accelerating the further application of LLMs in knowledge-intensive fields.

<title>Annotation Guidelines-Based Knowledge Augmentation: Towards Enhancing Large Language Models for Educational Text Classification</title>

Abstract: Various machine learning approaches have gained significant popularity for the automated classification of educational text to identify indicators of learning engagement -- i.e. learning engagement classification (LEC). LEC can offer comprehensive insights into human learning processes, attracting significant interest from diverse research communities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Learning Analytics, and Educational Data Mining. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. However, their comprehensive evaluation and improvement approaches in LEC tasks have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we propose the Annotation Guidelines-based Knowledge Augmentation (AGKA) approach to improve LLMs. AGKA employs GPT 4.0 to retrieve label definition knowledge from annotation guidelines, and then applies the random under-sampler to select a few typical examples. Subsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation benchmark of LEC, which includes six LEC datasets covering behavior classification (question and urgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and cognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). The study results demonstrate that AGKA can enhance non-fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT 4.0 and Llama 3 70B. GPT 4.0 with AGKA few-shot outperforms full-shot fine-tuned models such as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification datasets. However, GPT 4.0 lags in multi-class tasks that require a deep understanding of complex semantic information. Notably, Llama 3 70B with AGKA is a promising combination based on open-source LLM, because its performance is on par with closed-source GPT 4.0 with AGKA. In addition, LLMs struggle to distinguish between labels with similar names in multi-class classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in various capabilities but pose safety risks such as generating harmful content and misinformation, even after safety alignment. In this paper, we explore the inner mechanisms of safety alignment through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, focusing on identifying and analyzing safety neurons within LLMs that are responsible for safety behaviors. We propose inference-time activation contrasting to locate these neurons and dynamic activation patching to evaluate their causal effects on model safety. Experiments on multiple prevalent LLMs demonstrate that we can consistently identify about $5\%$ safety neurons, and by only patching their activations we can restore over $90\%$ of the safety performance across various red-teaming benchmarks without influencing general ability. The finding of safety neurons also helps explain the ''alignment tax'' phenomenon by revealing that the key neurons for model safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, yet they require different activation patterns for the same neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of our findings in safeguarding LLMs by detecting unsafe outputs before generation. The source code is available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/SafetyNeuron.

Abstract: Existing Vietnamese Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets lack adversarial complexity, limiting their ability to evaluate model robustness against challenging linguistic phenomena. In this article, we address the gap in robust Vietnamese NLI resources by introducing ViANLI, the first adversarial NLI dataset for Vietnamese, and propose NLIMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts model to tackle its complexity. We construct ViANLI using an adversarial human-and-machine-in-the-loop approach with rigorous verification. NLIMoE integrates expert subnetworks with a learned dynamic routing mechanism on top of a shared transformer encoder. ViANLI comprises over 10,000 premise-hypothesis pairs and challenges state-of-the-art models, with XLM-R Large achieving only 45.5% accuracy, while NLIMoE reaches 47.3%. Training with ViANLI improves performance on other benchmark Vietnamese NLI datasets including ViNLI, VLSP2021-NLI, and VnNewsNLI. ViANLI is released for enhancing research into model robustness and enriching resources for future Vietnamese and multilingual NLI research.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial in ensuring desirable and controllable model behaviors. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on the Bradley-Terry (B-T) model to maximize the likelihood of pairwise choices. However, when multiple responses are available, the B-T model fails to guarantee an accurate list ranking of the responses. To address this issue, we propose Permutative Preference Alignment (PPA), a novel offline listwise approach that incorporates the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), a widely-used ranking metric, as an alternative training objective for LLM alignment. We develop an end-to-end alignment algorithm by approximating NDCG with a differentiable surrogate loss. Experiments demonstrate that PPA outperforms existing pairwise and listwise methods on evaluation sets and general benchmarks such as AlpacaEval. Furthermore, we show that NDCG-based approaches improve ranking accuracy more effectively than B-T-based methods and provide a theoretical explanation for this improvement.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.

<title>Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.

Abstract: The typical Selective State-Space Model (SSM) used in Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as the quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length and the significant memory requirements during inference due to the key-value (KV) cache. However, the increasing size of Mamba models continues to pose challenges for training and deployment, particularly due to their substantial computational demands during both training and inference. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed to enable more efficient large language models (LLMs), with model sizes of 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B parameters. $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ models are trained from scratch on a standard LLM-scale dataset using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ achieves performance comparable to its full-precision (FP16 or BF16) counterparts, while outperforming post-training binarization (PTB) Mamba and binarization-aware training (BAT) Transformer baselines. Moreover, $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ drastically reduces memory usage and computational cost compared to the original Mamba. Our work pioneers a new line of linear-complexity LLMs under low-bit representation and provides the way for the design of specialized hardware optimized for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based models. Code and the pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/Tangshengku/Bi-Mamba.

Abstract: Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.

Abstract: We investigate transformer-based language models, including RoBERTa, T5, Llama-3, and MatSciBERT, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual descriptions. The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, driven by techniques like Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2023) and its extensions (Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c; Peng et al., 2023). By adjusting RoPE parameters and incorporating training data with extended contexts, we can train performant models with considerably longer input sequences. However, existing RoPE-based methods exhibit performance limitations when applied to extended context lengths. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various attention mechanisms, including RoPE, No Positional Embedding (NoPE), and Query-Key Normalization (QK-Norm), identifying their strengths and shortcomings in long-context modeling. Our investigation identifies distinctive attention patterns in these methods and highlights their impact on long-context performance, providing valuable insights for architectural design. Building on these findings, we propose a novel architecture featuring a hybrid attention mechanism that integrates global and local attention spans. This design not only surpasses conventional RoPE-based transformer models with full attention in both long and short context tasks but also delivers substantial efficiency gains during training and inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) process entire input contexts indiscriminately, which is inefficient when the information required to answer a query is localized within the context. We present dynamic context cutoff, a novel method enabling LLMs to self-terminate processing upon acquiring sufficient task-relevant information. Through analysis of model internals, we discover that specific attention heads inherently encode "sufficiency signals" -- detectable through lightweight classifiers -- that predict when critical information has been processed. This reveals a new efficiency paradigm: models' internal understanding naturally dictates processing needs rather than external compression heuristics. Comprehensive experiments across six QA datasets (up to 40K tokens) with three model families (LLaMA/Qwen/Mistral, 1B-70B) demonstrate 3.4% accuracy improvement while achieving 1.33x token reduction on average. Furthermore, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to other context efficiency methods at equivalent token reduction rates. Additionally, we observe an emergent scaling phenomenon: while smaller models require probing for sufficiency detection, larger models exhibit intrinsic self-assessment capabilities through prompting.

<title>Heterogeneous Swarms: Jointly Optimizing Model Roles and Weights for Multi-LLM Systems</title>

Abstract: We propose Heterogeneous Swarms, an algorithm to design multi-LLM systems by jointly optimizing model roles and weights. We represent multi-LLM systems as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of LLMs with topological message passing for collaborative generation. Given a pool of LLM experts and a utility function, Heterogeneous Swarms employs two iterative steps: role-step and weight-step. For role-step, we interpret model roles as learning a DAG that specifies the flow of inputs and outputs between LLMs. Starting from a swarm of random continuous adjacency matrices, we decode them into discrete DAGs, call the LLMs in topological order, evaluate on the utility function (e.g. accuracy on a task), and optimize the adjacency matrices with particle swarm optimization based on the utility score. For weight-step, we assess the contribution of individual LLMs in the multi-LLM systems and optimize model weights with swarm intelligence. We propose JFK-score to quantify the individual contribution of each LLM in the best-found DAG of the role-step, then optimize model weights with particle swarm optimization based on the JFK-score. Experiments demonstrate that Heterogeneous Swarms outperforms 15 role- and/or weight-based baselines by 18.5% on average across 12 tasks. Further analysis reveals that Heterogeneous Swarms discovers multi-LLM systems with heterogeneous model roles and substantial collaborative gains, and benefits from the diversity of language models.

Abstract: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

Abstract: As the use of large language model (LLM) agents continues to grow, their safety vulnerabilities have become increasingly evident. Extensive benchmarks evaluate various aspects of LLM safety by defining the safety relying heavily on general standards, overlooking user-specific standards. However, safety standards for LLM may vary based on a user-specific profiles rather than being universally consistent across all users. This raises a critical research question: Do LLM agents act safely when considering user-specific safety standards? Despite its importance for safe LLM use, no benchmark datasets currently exist to evaluate the user-specific safety of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce U-SafeBench, a benchmark designed to assess user-specific aspect of LLM safety. Our evaluation of 20 widely used LLMs reveals current LLMs fail to act safely when considering user-specific safety standards, marking a new discovery in this field. To address this vulnerability, we propose a simple remedy based on chain-of-thought, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user-specific safety. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/yeonjun-in/U-SafeBench.

Abstract: Activation steering methods in large language models (LLMs) have emerged as an effective way to perform targeted updates to enhance generated language without requiring large amounts of adaptation data. We ask whether the features discovered by activation steering methods are interpretable. We identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., ``cat'') using the ``finding experts'' method from research on activation steering and show that the ExpertLens, i.e., inspection of these neurons provides insights about model representation. We find that ExpertLens representations are stable across models and datasets and closely align with human representations inferred from behavioral data, matching inter-human alignment levels. ExpertLens significantly outperforms the alignment captured by word/sentence embeddings. By reconstructing human concept organization through ExpertLens, we show that it enables a granular view of LLM concept representation. Our findings suggest that ExpertLens is a flexible and lightweight approach for capturing and analyzing model representations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy of Large Language Model (LLM) responses by leveraging relevant external documents during generation. Although previous studies noted that retrieving many documents can degrade performance, they did not isolate how the quantity of documents affects performance while controlling for context length. We evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from a multi-hop QA task. We keep the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents, and find that increasing the document count in RAG settings poses significant challenges for most LLMs, reducing performance by up to 20%. However, Qwen2.5 maintained consistent results across increasing document counts, indicating better multi-document handling capability. Finally, our results indicate that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts. We also make the datasets and code available: https://github.com/shaharl6000/MoreDocsSameLen .

Abstract: A full understanding of the behavior of a large language model (LLM) requires our grasp of its input token space. If this space differs from our assumptions, our comprehension of and conclusions about the LLM will likely be flawed. We elucidate the structure of the token embeddings both empirically and theoretically. We present a novel statistical test assuming that the neighborhood around each token has a relatively flat and smooth structure as the null hypothesis. Failing to reject the null is uninformative, but rejecting it at a specific token $\psi$ implies an irregularity in the token subspace in a $\psi$-neighborhood, $B(\psi)$. The structure assumed in the null is a generalization of a manifold with boundary called a \emph{smooth fiber bundle} (which can be split into two spatial regimes -- small and large radius), so we denote our new hypothesis test as the ``fiber bundle hypothesis.'' By running our test over several open-source LLMs, each with unique token embeddings, we find that the null is frequently rejected, and so the evidence suggests that the token subspace is not a fiber bundle and hence also not a manifold. As a consequence of our findings, when an LLM is presented with two semantically equivalent prompts, if one prompt contains a token implicated by our test, the response to that prompt will likely exhibit less stability than the other.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges in representation learning by requiring models to capture both the semantic richness of node-associated texts and the structural dependencies of the graph. While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at modeling topological information, they lack the capacity to process unstructured text. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are proficient in text understanding but are typically unaware of graph structure. In this work, we propose BiGTex (Bidirectional Graph Text), a novel architecture that tightly integrates GNNs and LLMs through stacked Graph-Text Fusion Units. Each unit allows for mutual attention between textual and structural representations, enabling information to flow in both directions, text influencing structure and structure guiding textual interpretation. The proposed architecture is trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), keeping the LLM frozen while adapting to task-specific signals. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and generalizes effectively to link prediction. An ablation study further highlights the importance of soft prompting and bi-directional attention in the model's success.

Abstract: When applying reinforcement learning--typically through GRPO--to large vision-language model reasoning struggles to effectively scale reasoning length or generates verbose outputs across all tasks with only marginal gains in accuracy. To address this issue, we present FAST-GRPO, a variant of GRPO that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics. Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect performance. Inspired by these observations, we introduce two complementary metrics to estimate the difficulty of the questions, guiding the model to determine when fast or slow thinking is more appropriate. Next, we incorporate adaptive length-based rewards and difficulty-aware KL divergence into the GRPO algorithm. Experiments across seven reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over 10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively balancing reasoning length and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces S-DAT (Synthetic-Divergent Association Task), a scalable, multilingual framework for automated assessment of divergent thinking (DT) -a core component of human creativity. Traditional creativity assessments are often labor-intensive, language-specific, and reliant on subjective human ratings, limiting their scalability and cross-cultural applicability. In contrast, S-DAT leverages large language models and advanced multilingual embeddings to compute semantic distance -- a language-agnostic proxy for DT. We evaluate S-DAT across eleven diverse languages, including English, Spanish, German, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana), demonstrating robust and consistent scoring across linguistic contexts. Unlike prior DAT approaches, the S-DAT shows convergent validity with other DT measures and correct discriminant validity with convergent thinking. This cross-linguistic flexibility allows for more inclusive, global-scale creativity research, addressing key limitations of earlier approaches. S-DAT provides a powerful tool for fairer, more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive flexibility in diverse populations and can be freely assessed online: https://sdat.iol.zib.de/.

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in academic workflows, their capabilities remain limited to support high-quality scientific writing. Most existing systems are designed for general-purpose scientific text generation and fail to meet the sophisticated demands of research communication beyond surface-level polishing, such as conceptual coherence across sections. Furthermore, academic writing is inherently iterative and revision-driven, a process not well supported by direct prompting-based paradigms. To address these scenarios, we propose a human-AI collaboration framework for academic paper revision centered on criteria-guided intent alignment and context-aware modeling. To validate the framework, we curate a dataset of 7,000 research papers from top-tier venues annotated with 140,000 instruction-response pairs that reflect realistic, section-level scientific revisions. We instantiate the framework in XtraGPT, the first suite of open-source LLMs (1.5B to 14B parameters) for context-aware, instruction-guided writing assistance. Extensive experiments validate that XtraGPT significantly outperforms same-scale baselines and approaches the quality of proprietary systems. Both automated preference assessments and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of XtraGPT in improving scientific drafts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have inherent limitations of faithfulness and factuality, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Several benchmarks have been developed that provide a test bed for factuality evaluation within the context of English-centric datasets, while relying on supplementary informative context like web links or text passages but ignoring the available structured factual resources. To this end, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been identified as a useful aid for hallucination mitigation, as they provide a structured way to represent the facts about entities and their relations with minimal linguistic overhead. We bridge the lack of KG paths and multilinguality for factual language modeling within the existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks and propose a KG-based multilingual, multihop benchmark called MultiHal framed for generative text evaluation. As part of our data collection pipeline, we mined 140k KG-paths from open-domain KGs, from which we pruned noisy KG-paths, curating a high-quality subset of 25.9k. Our baseline evaluation shows an absolute scale improvement by approximately 0.12 to 0.36 points for the semantic similarity score, 0.16 to 0.36 for NLI entailment and 0.29 to 0.42 for hallucination detection in KG-RAG over vanilla QA across multiple languages and multiple models, demonstrating the potential of KG integration. We anticipate MultiHal will foster future research towards several graph-based hallucination mitigation and fact-checking tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in flagging harmful content in online communities. Yet, existing approaches for moderation require a separate model for every community and are opaque in their decision-making, limiting real-world adoption. We introduce Mixture of Moderation Experts (MoMoE), a modular, cross-community framework that adds post-hoc explanations to scalable content moderation. MoMoE orchestrates four operators -- Allocate, Predict, Aggregate, Explain -- and is instantiated as seven community-specialized experts (MoMoE-Community) and five norm-violation experts (MoMoE-NormVio). On 30 unseen subreddits, the best variants obtain Micro-F1 scores of 0.72 and 0.67, respectively, matching or surpassing strong fine-tuned baselines while consistently producing concise and reliable explanations. Although community-specialized experts deliver the highest peak accuracy, norm-violation experts provide steadier performance across domains. These findings show that MoMoE yields scalable, transparent moderation without needing per-community fine-tuning. More broadly, they suggest that lightweight, explainable expert ensembles can guide future NLP and HCI research on trustworthy human-AI governance of online communities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications, yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity, vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2 Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

Abstract: How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when those beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of understanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze LMs' ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal mediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset, CausalToM, consisting of simple stories where two characters independently change the state of two objects, potentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovers a pervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables the LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds each character-object-state triple together by co-locating their reference information, represented as Ordering IDs (OIs), in low-rank subspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's beliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the correct state OI and then the answer lookback retrieves the corresponding state token. When we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the other, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the relation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility lookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character and update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering ToM reasoning in LMs.

Abstract: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution, passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional training and negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: LLM-powered embodied agents have shown success on conventional object-rearrangement tasks, but providing personalized assistance that leverages user-specific knowledge from past interactions presents new challenges. We investigate these challenges through the lens of agents' memory utilization along two critical dimensions: object semantics (identifying objects based on personal meaning) and user patterns (recalling sequences from behavioral routines). To assess these capabilities, we construct MEMENTO, an end-to-end two-stage evaluation framework comprising single-memory and joint-memory tasks. Our experiments reveal that current agents can recall simple object semantics but struggle to apply sequential user patterns to planning. Through in-depth analysis, we identify two critical bottlenecks: information overload and coordination failures when handling multiple memories. Based on these findings, we explore memory architectural approaches to address these challenges. Given our observation that episodic memory provides both personalized knowledge and in-context learning benefits, we design a hierarchical knowledge graph-based user-profile memory module that separately manages personalized knowledge, achieving substantial improvements on both single and joint-memory tasks.

We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's effectiveness through 392 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in cross-distribution settings with limited data and investigate how mitigation impacts model performance on non-toxic tasks, revealing trade-offs between safety and knowledge preservation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks. Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths, highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for future work in latent reasoning.

<title>On the Emergence of Linear Analogies in Word Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a powerful method for accelerating autoregressive generation in large language models (LLMs), yet its integration into vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. We introduce DREAM, a novel speculative decoding framework tailored for VLMs that combines three key innovations: (1) a cross-attention-based mechanism to inject intermediate features from the target model into the draft model for improved alignment, (2) adaptive intermediate feature selection based on attention entropy to guide efficient draft model training, and (3) visual token compression to reduce draft model latency. DREAM enables efficient, accurate, and parallel multimodal decoding with significant throughput improvement. Experiments across a diverse set of recent popular VLMs, including LLaVA, Pixtral, SmolVLM and Gemma3, demonstrate up to 3.6x speedup over conventional decoding and significantly outperform prior SD baselines in both inference throughput and speculative draft acceptance length across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SAI-Lab-NYU/DREAM.git

Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and ensuring access to justice, yet remains costly and inaccessible to many individuals due to the shortage of professionals. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost legal assistance, current systems fall short in handling the interactive and knowledge-intensive nature of real-world consultations. To address these challenges, we introduce LeCoDe, a real-world multi-turn benchmark dataset comprising 3,696 legal consultation dialogues with 110,008 dialogue turns, designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video platforms, providing authentic multi-turn legal consultation dialogues. The rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of (1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to enhance LLMs' legal consultation abilities. Our benchmark contributes to advancing research in legal domain dialogue systems, particularly in simulating more real-world user-expert interactions.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge is a framework where a large language model (LLM) evaluates the output of another LLM. While LLMs excel at producing qualitative textual evaluations, they often struggle to predict human preferences and numeric scores. We propose quantitative LLM judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to humans in a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the score of the original judge using its rationale and score. We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is limited, which is expected in practice. We validate these claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show that quantitative judges can improve the predictive power of existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative despite inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been explored for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial settings remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains, producing DACP-applied sLLMs (ixi-GEN). Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that ixi-GEN models achieve substantial gains in target-domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech, vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a \textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to isolated Q&amp;A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric} bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000 dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All code and datasets will be released soon. We release the datasets at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xiangh/RMTBENCH.

Abstract: Modern approaches to enhancing Large Language Models' factual accuracy and knowledge utilization face a fundamental trade-off: non-parametric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides flexible access to external knowledge but suffers from high inference latency and shallow integration, while parametric fine-tuning methods like LoRA risk catastrophic forgetting and degraded general capabilities. In this work, we propose MLP Memory, a lightweight parametric module that learns to internalize retrieval patterns without explicit document access. By pretraining an MLP to imitate a $k$NN retriever's behavior on the entire pretraining dataset, we create a differentiable memory component that captures the benefits of retrieval-based knowledge access in a fully parametric form. Our architecture integrates this pretrained MLP Memory with Transformer decoders through simple probability interpolation, yielding 17.5\% and 24.1\% scaling gains on WikiText-103 and Web datasets, respectively. It further achieves 12.3\% relative improvement on five question-answering benchmarks and 5.2 points absolute gain across nine general NLP tasks, while reducing hallucinations by up to 10 points on HaluEval. Moreover, MLP Memory delivers 2.5$\times$ faster inference than RAG with superior accuracy. Our findings show that learning retrieval patterns parametrically bridges the gap between efficient inference and effective knowledge access, offering a practical alternative to both RAG and fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in general language tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains a challenge. Current method like Domain Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT) requires costly full-parameter training and suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces substantial inference latency due to expensive nearest-neighbor searches and longer context. This paper introduces Memory Decoder, a plug-and-play pretrained memory that enables efficient domain adaptation without changing the original model's parameters. Memory Decoder employs a small transformer decoder that learns to imitate the behavior of an external non-parametric retriever. Once trained, Memory Decoder can be seamlessly integrated with any pretrained language model that shares the same tokenizer, requiring no model-specific modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that Memory Decoder enables effective adaptation of various Qwen and Llama models to three distinct specialized domains: biomedicine, finance, and law, reducing perplexity by an average of 6.17 points. Overall, Memory Decoder introduces a novel paradigm centered on a specially pretrained memory component designed for domain-specific adaptation. This memory architecture can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner, consistently enhancing performance across multiple models within the target domain.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning. Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions. Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/debate-or-vote.

<title>Blockwise SFT for Diffusion Language Models: Reconciling Bidirectional Attention and Autoregressive Decoding</title>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.

<title>LFD: Layer Fused Decoding to Exploit External Knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements, generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up to 20 percent across providers.

Abstract: Biomedical literature and clinical narratives pose multifaceted challenges for natural language understanding, from precise entity extraction and document synthesis to multi-step diagnostic reasoning. This study extends a unified benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across five core biomedical NLP tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, summarization, and simplification, and nine expanded biomedical QA datasets covering factual knowledge, clinical reasoning, and multimodal visual understanding. Using standardized prompts, fixed decoding parameters, and consistent inference pipelines, we assessed model performance, latency, and token-normalized cost under official pricing. GPT-5 consistently outperformed GPT-4o, with the largest gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as MedXpertQA and DiagnosisArena and stable improvements in multimodal QA. In core tasks, GPT-5 achieved better chemical NER and ChemProt scores but remained below domain-tuned baselines for disease NER and summarization. Despite producing longer outputs, GPT-5 showed comparable latency and 30 to 50 percent lower effective cost per correct prediction. Fine-grained analyses revealed improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and reasoning subtypes, whereas boundary-sensitive extraction and evidence-dense summarization remain challenging. Overall, GPT-5 approaches deployment-ready performance for biomedical QA while offering a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability, and economic efficiency. The results support a tiered prompting strategy: direct prompting for large-scale or cost-sensitive applications, and chain-of-thought scaffolds for analytically complex or high-stakes scenarios, highlighting the continued need for hybrid solutions where precision and factual fidelity are critical.

Abstract: Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution, while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized foundation for memory control in agents.

Abstract: Medical English-Vietnamese machine translation (En-Vi MT) is essential for healthcare access and communication in Vietnam, yet Vietnamese remains a low-resource and under-studied language. We systematically evaluate prompting strategies for six multilingual LLMs (0.5B-9B parameters) on the MedEV dataset, comparing zero-shot, few-shot, and dictionary-augmented prompting with Meddict, an English-Vietnamese medical lexicon. Results show that model scale is the primary driver of performance: larger LLMs achieve strong zero-shot results, while few-shot prompting yields only marginal improvements. In contrast, terminology-aware cues and embedding-based example retrieval consistently improve domain-specific translation. These findings underscore both the promise and the current limitations of multilingual LLMs for medical En-Vi MT.

Abstract: Legal documents are often long, dense, and difficult to comprehend, not only for laypeople but also for legal experts. While automated document summarization has great potential to improve access to legal knowledge, prevailing task-based evaluators overlook divergent user and stakeholder needs. Tool development is needed to encompass the technicality of a case summary for a litigator yet be accessible for a self-help public researching for their lawsuit. We introduce PersonaMatrix, a persona-by-criterion evaluation framework that scores summaries through the lens of six personas, including legal and non-legal users. We also introduce a controlled dimension-shifted pilot dataset of U.S. civil rights case summaries that varies along depth, accessibility, and procedural detail as well as Diversity-Coverage Index (DCI) to expose divergent optima of legal summary between persona-aware and persona-agnostic judges. This work enables refinement of legal AI summarization systems for both expert and non-expert users, with the potential to increase access to legal knowledge. The code base and data are publicly available in GitHub.

Abstract: Intent classification models have made a significant progress in recent years. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource language datasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with high rates of illiteracy, where languages are more spoken than read or written. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\% of the population, while the national illiteracy rate remains at of 42\%. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To address these limitations, we introduce the Wolof Banking Speech Intent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current dataset. In addition, this paper presents an in-depth examination of the dataset's contents. We report baseline F1-scores and word error rates metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also comparisons between models.

Abstract: Domain-specific LLMs in TCM face limitations in research settings due to constrained adaptability, insufficient evaluation datasets, and limited computational resources. This study presents TianHui, a specialized TCM LLM built through contextual data integration and domain knowledge fusion. We constructed a large-scale TCM corpus (0.97GB unsupervised data + 611,312 QA pairs) and employed a two-stage training strategy with QLoRA, DeepSpeed Stage 2, and Flash Attention 2. Evaluation on 12 benchmarks showed TianHui ranked top-three in all metrics for six datasets (APQ, TCMCD, HFR, HCCA, DHPE, TLAW) and achieved top results in the other six (TCMEE, APR, GCPMI, TCMKQA, TCMRC, ADTG). Optimal configuration was identified as LoRA rank=128, alpha=256, epoch=4, dropout=0.2, max length=2048. TianHui enables systematic preservation and scalable application of TCM knowledge.

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy, computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315 English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3 percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates 88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration, robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence. Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally, our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

<title>Curing Miracle Steps in LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Rubric Rewards</title>

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems. However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually rich item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we identify a U-shaped relationship between text-image dissimilarity and recommendation performance, suggesting the benefit of applying multimodal prompting selectively. To support efficient real-time inference, we also introduce X-Reflect-keyword, a lightweight variant that summarizes image content using keywords and replaces the base model with a smaller backbone, achieving nearly 50% reduction in input length while maintaining competitive performance. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents an effective solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.

Abstract: Faces and humans are crucial elements in social interaction and are widely included in everyday photos and videos. Therefore, a deep understanding of faces and humans will enable multi-modal assistants to achieve improved response quality and broadened application scope. Currently, the multi-modal assistant community lacks a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of face and human understanding abilities. In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench includes a development set and a test set, each with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. We also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models. The dataset and evaluation code have been made publicly available at https://face-human-bench.github.io.

<title>Twilight: Adaptive Attention Sparsity with Hierarchical Top-$p$ Pruning</title>

Abstract: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.

<title>MIR-Bench: Can Your LLM Recognize Complicated Patterns via Many-Shot In-Context Reasoning?</title>

Abstract: The ability to recognize patterns from examples and apply them to new ones is a primal ability for general intelligence, and is widely studied by psychology and AI researchers. Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually <10) setting and lack evaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from long contexts. On the other hand, the ever-growing context length of LLMs have brought forth the novel paradigm of many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), which addresses new tasks with hundreds to thousands of examples without expensive and inefficient fine-tuning. However, many-shot evaluations often focus on classification, and popular long-context LLM tasks such as Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) seldom require complicated intelligence for integrating many pieces of information. To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the first many-shot in-context reasoning benchmark for pattern recognition that asks LLM to predict output via input-output examples from underlying functions with diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study many novel problems for many-shot in-context reasoning, and acquired many insightful findings including scaling effect, robustness, inductive vs. transductive reasoning, retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), coding for inductive reasoning, cross-domain generalizability, etc.

<title>Toward Metaphor-Fluid Conversation Design for Voice User Interfaces</title>

Abstract: Metaphors play a critical role in shaping user experiences with Voice User Interfaces (VUIs), yet existing designs often rely on static, human-centric metaphors that fail to adapt to diverse contexts and user needs. This paper introduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts metaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare this approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation of commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant, offering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130), metaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy, revealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2 (N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the Metaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and likability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts. However, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for personalization. These findings challenge the one-size-fits-all paradigm of VUI design and demonstrate the potential of Metaphor-Fluid Design to create more adaptive and engaging human-AI interactions.

<title>Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

<title>Superposition Yields Robust Neural Scaling</title>

Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law, that loss decreases as a power law with model size, remains unclear. We propose that representation superposition, meaning that LLMs represent more features than they have dimensions, can be a key contributor to loss and cause neural scaling. Based on Anthropic's toy model, we use weight decay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically study how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss follows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed. In contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely with model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to geometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that open-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss scaling like one over the model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws are also consistent with this behavior. Our results identify representation superposition as a central driver of neural scaling laws, providing insights into questions like when neural scaling laws can be improved and when they will break down.

<title>SAFEPATH: Preventing Harmful Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought via Early Alignment</title>

arXiv:2505.14667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer AI.

<title>RL Tango: Reinforcing Generator and Verifier Together for Language Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15034</link>

arXiv:2505.15034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However, current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

arXiv:2505.20612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP! Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/roboflow/rf100-vl and https://universe.roboflow.com/rf100-vl/.

<title>Born a Transformer -- Always a Transformer? On the Effect of Pretraining on Architectural Abilities</title>

arXiv:2505.21785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain sequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations play a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively overcome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models themselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural constraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of $\textit{retrieval}$ and $\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al. [2024a]. We use a recently proposed framework for studying length generalization [Huang et al., 2025] to provide guarantees for each of our settings. Empirically, we observe an $\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$ asymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right (induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This asymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is guaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is connected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction circuits within pretrained transformers. We validate our findings through practical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our results highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain transformer capabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.

Abstract: Reasoning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they still face significant challenges: they are highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated data or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains. To address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to enhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning VLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings, we introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training framework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a preference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic $\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction capabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to self-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B model, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching an average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after self-correction. It outperforms LLaVA-CoT (63.2), Mulberry (63.9), and LlamaV-o1 (63.4) while using less than 20% of the annotated data.

arXiv:2505.23883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors, learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M, comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding space.

<title>Does Thinking More always Help? Mirage of Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.

arXiv:2506.13992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems. Our data and code are publicly available here: https://github.com/jeremyxianx/Assisted-DS

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

arXiv:2508.04586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically, with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3) psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically, with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

<title>ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15235v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding. Code is available at https://github.com/KangJialiang/ViSpec.

<title>FlyLoRA: Boosting Task Decoupling and Parameter Efficiency via Implicit Rank-Wise Mixture-of-Experts</title>

arXiv:2510.08396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference, resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

<title>A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System</title>

arXiv:2510.09721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has driven a transition from traditional rule-based systems to autonomous agentic systems capable of solving complex problems. However, systematic progress is hindered by a lack of comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect. This survey addresses this gap by providing the first holistic analysis of LLM-powered software engineering, offering insights into evaluation methodologies and solution paradigms. We review over 150 recent papers and propose a taxonomy along two key dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, including tasks such as code generation, translation, and repair. Our analysis highlights the evolution from simple prompt engineering to sophisticated agentic systems incorporating capabilities like planning, reasoning, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. To contextualize this progress, we present a unified pipeline illustrating the workflow from task specification to deliverables, detailing how different solution paradigms address various complexity levels. Unlike prior surveys that focus narrowly on specific aspects, this work connects 50+ benchmarks to their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for diverse evaluation criteria. We also identify critical research gaps and propose future directions, including multi-agent collaboration, self-evolving systems, and formal verification integration. This survey serves as a foundational guide for advancing LLM-driven software engineering.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses. The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense, such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series. Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform complex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online information, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs with such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is especially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as biosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice: simply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can elicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the elevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet, jailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks, as they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap, we propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects malicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes harmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive experiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including general and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key findings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful prompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step planning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities that prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass refusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content, compared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental misalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to DR agents.

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

<div> information retrieval, geoscience literature, MiniLMs, semantic search, sentiment analysis 

Summary: 
The study introduces a framework that utilizes MiniLMs for efficient information retrieval from a vast corpus of geoscience literature. By curating a dataset from leading peer-reviewed journals, MiniLMs offer a cost-effective and precise alternative to large language models. Unlike LLMs, MiniLMs excel at extracting domain-specific information with established sources, particularly quantitative findings. Through semantic search techniques and sentence-level indexing, MiniLMs can identify expert-verified information and track the evolution of research trends within geoscience communities. Additionally, sentiment analysis and unsupervised clustering allow for the analysis of emotional tone and topical clusters within the literature. MiniLM shows promise for applications such as fact retrieval, trend analysis, contradiction analysis, and educational purposes within the geoscience field. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established, multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities. Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction analyses, and educational purposes.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, instruction-following, evaluation framework, empirical study, failure modes

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new, streamlined evaluation framework for assessing instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework consists of twenty carefully designed prompts covering various task categories to diagnose specific instruction adherence patterns. A large-scale empirical study was conducted on 256 verified working models from major providers and emerging implementations. The study aimed to assess genuine capabilities rather than memorized performance, revealing consistent failure modes and identifying specific instruction types posing challenges. The methodology includes verifiable instructions, compact test suite, and evaluation of format compliance, content constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. This work offers a practical diagnostic tool for researchers and practitioners to assess LLM instruction-following capabilities efficiently. Overall, the study contributes to understanding the instruction-following abilities across the contemporary LLM landscape. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14, 2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the contemporary LLM landscape.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for generating multilingual text and source code, but their high computational cost and accuracy trade-offs leave room for improvement. This study proposes fine-tuning encoder-only Small Language Models (SLMs) like RoBERTa and CodeBERTa with specialized datasets to outperform LLMs in binary classification tasks. The SLMs achieve high AUROC and macro-F1 scores while using significantly less compute resources, reducing latency by 8-12 times and peak VRAM by 3-5 times at 512-token inputs. Moreover, the SLMs maintain over 92% of clean AUROC performance under cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations such as paraphrasing and code formatting. The study provides training and evaluation scripts, reproducibility checklist, and demonstrates the effectiveness of SLMs in content detection tasks across domains.

The SLMs demonstrate high AUROC and macro-F1 scores while minimizing compute resources, significantly reducing latency and VRAM usage.

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy, often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement. To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $= 0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by $8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase, back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs; a reproducibility checklist is also included.

<div> Keywords: social media, topic modeling, COVID-19, Twitter, language models

Summary:
TM-Rephrase is a model-agnostic framework designed to enhance topic modeling in analyzing public discourse on social media platforms like Twitter, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework leverages large language models to rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language before topic modeling. The study utilized a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts and examined two rephrasing strategies: general- and colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing. Results showed that TM-Rephrase improved topic coherence, uniqueness, and diversity metrics while reducing topic redundancy across various topic modeling algorithms. The colloquial-to-formal rephrasing strategy yielded the most significant performance gains, particularly for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of public discourse surrounding health crises on social media and demonstrates the potential for enhancing topic modeling in various important domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: TM-Rephrase framework enhances topic modeling on social media, especially for COVID-19 discussions, leveraging language models. Results show significant improvements in topic coherence, uniqueness, and diversity, reducing redundancy in topic modeling. Strategy of colloquial-to-formal rephrasing stands out for LDA algorithm, offering insights for public health discourse analysis. <div>

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms, with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important domains.

<div> Keywords: pre-training data, language models, data selection, diversity, orthogonal dimensions

Summary: 
Pre-training data quality is essential for large language models, with factual reliability and semantic value being key factors. Existing methods for data selection based on scores often overlook diversity, leading to decreased performance. The Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm proposed in this study addresses this issue by evaluating data on multiple dimensions and utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decorrelate scores and select top-quality data across orthogonal dimensions. Empirical results support the effectiveness of ODiS in preserving both quality and diversity in pre-training data selection for language models, with models trained using ODiS-selected data outperforming other baselines on downstream benchmarks. This highlights the importance of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for optimizing the performance of large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores, enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension, thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection for LLMs.

Summary:  
- Large language models can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to biases in their internal representations, affecting fairness and consistency.  
- Current methods to address these issues are computationally expensive and slow to adapt to new contexts.  
- A dynamic and reversible pruning-based framework is proposed to mitigate biases by adjusting neuron activations based on context during generation.  
- This approach allows for fine-grained control over biases while preserving knowledge and coherence in multilingual conversations.  
- This framework enables real-time fairness control in conversational AI by dynamically masking neurons to adapt to changing conversation contexts. <div>
arXiv:2510.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift, amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors. However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues, enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities, collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive omni model's intelligence evolution.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy misinformation detection.

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density, clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships, which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

<div> framework, long-horizon, SLIM, search, trajectory <br />
Summary: 
The study focuses on long-horizon agentic search and the challenges faced by existing frameworks in scaling to long trajectories due to context limitations. A new framework called SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management) is proposed, which separates retrieval into search and browse tools, and periodically summarizes the trajectory to keep context concise while enabling longer, more focused searches. SLIM achieves comparable performance at lower cost and fewer tool calls than strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. With o3 as the base model, SLIM outperforms all open-source frameworks on tasks like BrowseComp and HLE while incurring fewer tool calls. An automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy are provided for characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks. SLIM exhibits fewer hallucinations than prior systems, and the simple tool design of SLIM can potentially inform future long-horizon agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long, noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3 as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE, outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points, respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Summary:<br /><br /> Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often limited to tasks like mathematics and short-form question-answering. This study introduces ProfBench, a dataset of over 7000 response-criterion pairs evaluated by human experts with professional knowledge in various fields. LLM-Judges are built to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, making evaluation more accessible and affordable. The findings show that even top-performing LLMs like GPT-5-high struggle with the challenges posed by ProfBench, achieving only 65.9% overall performance. Disparities in performance are identified between proprietary and open-weight models, highlighting the importance of extended thinking in addressing complex professional-domain tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000 response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3 orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community. Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex, professional-domain tasks.

<div> Keywords: Oversensitivity, Language models, Defensive patterns, Challenging datasets, OVERBENCH

Summary:
This study addresses the issue of oversensitivity in language models, which leads them to incorrectly reject benign prompts. The defensive behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also blurs the line between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks using static datasets degrade over time as models evolve, resulting in data contamination and reduced evaluative power. To combat this, the authors introduce a framework that dynamically creates model-specific challenging datasets to capture emerging defensive patterns. This approach culminates in the development of OVERBENCH, a benchmark comprising 450,000 samples from 25 diverse language model families. OVERBENCH offers a dynamic and evolving perspective on oversensitivity, allowing for the continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as models progress, revealing vulnerabilities that static datasets fail to address. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets, capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000 samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

Summary: 
The article introduces the SCRIPTS dataset, containing 1k dialogues in English and Korean sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social reasoning capabilities in inferring interpersonal relationships between speakers. Models' performance on the task is around 75-80% for English and 58-69% for Korean datasets. Additionally, models occasionally select Unlikely relationships in their responses. Thinking models and chain-of-thought prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social reasoning and may amplify biases. The study highlights significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning abilities, emphasizing the necessity for the development of socially-aware language models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean, sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends, sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S. Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around 75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to 58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Mental Health Support, Dialogue Datasets, Judge Reliability Assessment, Evaluation Framework<br />
Summary:<br />
This article introduces two benchmarks, MentalBench-100k and MentalAlign-70k, to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support. MentalBench-100k provides 100,000 response pairs from one-turn conversations in real scenarios, paired with LLM-generated responses. MentalAlign-70k compares LLM judges with human experts on cognitive and affective attributes using the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework. The analysis shows systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for cognitive attributes, reduced precision for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. These benchmarks and evaluation frameworks aim to establish new methodological foundations for reliable, large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. The datasets and codes are available on GitHub for further research and development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability, often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets, each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs. MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts. Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable, large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization (training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance) across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to 77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings (13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer. Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization. Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

<br />
Summary: This paper explores how large language models respond when faced with conflicts between their learned knowledge and information presented in a prompt, focusing on code generation. The study introduces a domain-agnostic framework for creating and understanding such conflicts, with a new evaluation method and dataset specific to code conflict scenarios. Experiments reveal that large language models can recognize knowledge conflicts with up to 80.65% accuracy and that activation-level steering can enhance steering success by up to 12.6% compared to a random baseline. However, the effectiveness of steering depends on factors such as model size, task domain, and direction of steering. The experiment code and data will be shared with the public post-acceptance.

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA) research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters, enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy. Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline. However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain, and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly available after acceptance.

<div> Keywords: large language models, spectral analysis, transformer layers, graph signal processing, hallucination detection <br />
Summary:
Large language models, such as transformers, have shown impressive performance in various tasks, but there is a challenge in distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations. A new spectral analysis framework is proposed to model transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by attention, with token embeddings representing signals on these graphs. Through graph signal processing, diagnostics such as Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios are defined, with theoretical connections to computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures reveal universal spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent energy distribution with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types show distinct signatures. Spectral analysis can detect logical contradictions with significant effects, semantic errors with connectivity drift, and substitution hallucinations with intermediate perturbations. A simple detector based on spectral signatures achieves higher accuracy in hallucination detection compared to perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating the practical utility of this approach. <div>

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain" behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75% for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in large language models.

Summary: 
Using spectral analysis on transformer architectures, this study examines how different models implement linguistic computations through distinct connectivity patterns, revealing unique "computational fingerprints." The analysis focuses on voice alternation across 20 languages and three model families in early layers. Phi-3-Mini displays a significant disruption specific to English, while Qwen2.5-7B shows small shifts, especially in morphologically rich languages. LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but subtle responses. These spectral signatures correlate strongly with behavioral differences and can be modulated by attention head ablations. The study suggests that training emphasis leaves detectable computational imprints, reflecting specialized processing strategies during syntactic transformations. This framework can differentiate reasoning modes and serve as a diagnostic tool for architectural biases and model reliability analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted ``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption ($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19 other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small, distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations. Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes, indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools, evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity, orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics. Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for low-resource languages.

Summary: 
The paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to pass standardized hiring evaluations for software and algorithm engineers. It highlights the growing demand for engineers in technology companies and the importance of efficient candidate selection processes. By analyzing a professional assessment questionnaire, the study uses LLMs to generate responses and evaluates their performance. Surprisingly, the results show a significant discrepancy between the answers generated by the LLMs and the correct solutions provided by the companies. Ultimately, the study concludes that all evaluated LLMs fail to pass the hiring evaluation, challenging the perception of LLMs as ideal engineers. <div>
arXiv:2510.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process, which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to pass the hiring evaluation.

<br />
Efficient reasoning is vital for complex tasks like multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart) proposes a structured framework that improves efficiency by caching recurring prefixes and anchoring sub-queries to the main question. This reduces token generation costs and promotes stable reasoning. The framework also includes a retriever-based terminator to halt reasoning when sub-queries collapse into repetition, leading to faster inference and reliable answers. On benchmark datasets like HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency compared to other RAG-CoT approaches. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of TSSS in scenarios where efficiency is constrained, such as on-device inference.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios such as on-device inference.

Summary:
The article introduces evolveQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate Language Models (LLMs) on temporal knowledge conflicts arising from evolving facts. The benchmark is constructed from real-world, time-stamped corpora including AWS updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. It aims to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by focusing on temporally evolving knowledge and generating questions with gold answers catered to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. The evaluation of 12 LLMs using evolveQA revealed significant performance drops of up to 31% compared to static knowledge questions. This highlights the challenges LLMs face in handling temporal knowledge conflicts and underscores the importance of considering evolving information in training datasets. <div>

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered, easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

<div> knowledge graph retrieval, question answering system, paraphraser model, embeddings, fuzzy techniques

Summary:
In this paper, a question answering system is introduced that operates solely on knowledge graph retrieval without relying on large language models. The system utilizes a small paraphraser model to paraphrase entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the knowledge graph. The two-stage pipeline involves generating question-answer pairs from a pre-processed document, converting them into a knowledge graph, and performing graph-based retrieval using embeddings and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to generate the final answer. Evaluation on the CRAG benchmark with LLM-as-a-judge demonstrated accuracies of 71.9% with LLAMA-3.2 and 54.4% with GPT-3.5-Turbo. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Summary: <br />
The paper presents a new benchmark called TRACE for evaluating conversational AI systems using external tools. The existing evaluation methods for such systems are insufficient as they do not capture critical errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogues. The authors introduce a new evaluation framework called SCOPE that automatically discovers diverse error patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. The experiments show that SCOPE outperforms the baseline significantly, especially in challenging cases where user satisfaction signals are misleading. This approach addresses the complexities of evaluating conversational AI systems that rely on external tools and provides a more comprehensive assessment of system performance. <div>

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging, as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools. While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents' tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, query routing, DiSRouter, self-awareness, multi-agent systems

Summary: The article introduces DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a new approach to query routing for Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike centralized routing systems, DiSRouter uses a distributed network of LLM agents, allowing each agent to independently decide whether to answer queries or route them to other agents based on its self-awareness. This approach offers flexibility, scalability, and generalizability. The proposed Self-Awareness Training pipeline enhances each LLM's self-awareness, leading to improved performance across various scenarios and better differentiation between easy and hard queries. DiSRouter also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks, showing that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic self-awareness is more effective than external assessment. Overall, DiSRouter paves the way for more modular and efficient multi-agent systems in the realm of query routing for LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility, scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

Summary:
The paper introduces a framework for type-matched language distances to address limitations in existing linguistic knowledge bases. It proposes structure-aware representations for different distance types, such as speaker-weighted distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent variables model for typology. These representations are then unified into a robust, task-agnostic composite distance. By applying these novel approaches in selecting transfer languages, the performance across various NLP tasks is consistently improved. This new framework provides a more principled and effective toolkit for multilingual research, offering a comprehensive solution to leverage geographic, genetic, and typological distances in linguistic data analysis. <div>
arXiv:2510.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data, and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel, structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust, task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit for multilingual research.

Summary: <br />
SheetBrain is a framework designed to improve the accuracy of large language models in understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets. It consists of three modules: an understanding module, an execution module, and a validation module, to provide comprehensive spreadsheet overviews, facilitate multi-turn reasoning, and verify reasoning correctness. SheetBrain is evaluated on public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, as well as a new benchmark called SheetBench for more challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the newly introduced SheetBench. This framework aims to enhance the capabilities of large language models in accurately handling complex tabular data tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data, supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks. SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets. Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/SheetBrain.

Summary: 
This study introduces a new method for generating difficulty-controllable multiple-choice questions for reading comprehension. Traditional approaches have limitations in generating multiple-choice questions and optimizing difficulty control accuracy. To address these issues, the proposed method uses a large language model trained with a direct preference optimization technique to enhance difficulty control accuracy. By leveraging neural networks and advanced training techniques, the method aims to improve the adaptability of question generation for adaptive learning support in educational settings. The focus is on enhancing the controllability of difficulty levels in question generation, which is crucial for personalized learning experiences. The novel approach combines multiple-choice question generation with difficulty control, offering a more comprehensive and effective tool for educational applications.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the accuracy of difficulty control.

Summary:
The article introduces TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents and their performance on tasks involving interactions with real-world services. Using REST APIs, MCP servers are created with over 18,000 tools, providing ground-truth annotations for each task. Experimental results show that tool-calling agents can improve performance and reduce costs when perfect tool retrieval is assumed. However, smaller models struggle to leverage available tools effectively compared to larger models like GPT-5. The study highlights the challenges faced by advanced reasoning models in navigating complex enterprise environments and the importance of both reasoning and retrieval models in utilizing tools for problem-solving. TheMCPCompany emphasizes the difficulty of combining tens of thousands of tools to solve complex problems and underscores the need for improved reasoning and retrieval models for effective tool-based agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly. These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs. However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next, we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments. TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval models.

<div> Keywords: large language models, hallucination detection, claim extraction, query generation, reliable inputs 

Summary: 

- The study focuses on addressing the issue of hallucination in large language models (LLMs), which generate unreliable content that may appear factual.
- Existing methods for hallucination detection face limitations in claim extraction and query generation, leading to decreased performance in detecting unreliable content.
- The JointCQ framework introduced in this work combines claim-and-query generation to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of generating reliable inputs for downstream processes.
- By using carefully designed evaluation criteria and fine-tuning language models, the JointCQ framework outperforms previous methods on multiple open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues, i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e., claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

Summary:
KORE is a proposed method for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge. It achieves this through KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints. Unlike traditional data augmentation, KORE converts knowledge items into structured formats for accurate learning. It stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix of linear layer activations and initializes adapters to minimize interference. Extensive experiments on various models demonstrate that KORE outperforms existing methods in new knowledge injection and effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention (preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

A test set, HADTest, is carefully annotated for evaluating hallucination detection, containing 2,248 samples. Evaluation on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets shows that the HAD models outperform existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their robustness and versatility. The HAD models provide a promising approach for addressing hallucination and improving the reliability of NLG models.

Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their robustness and versatility.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO) as a novel strategy to optimize the multi-objective problem of text summarization using large language models (LLMs) enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). The HVO method dynamically adjusts scores between groups during the reward process in RL by using the hypervolume method, guiding the model to approximate the pareto front and generate balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on various summarization datasets show that HVO outperforms group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and achieves more balanced performance across different dimensions. Additionally, a 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task while producing shorter generation lengths. The code for this method is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence, relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task, while maintaining a shorter generation length.

Summary: <br />
The study proposes incorporating reasoning into speech large language models (speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task using a chain-of-thought framework. Multiple reasoning steps are introduced to improve performance, but a reasoning textual LLM designed for math and logic domains may not be the best foundation model. Hybrid speechLLMs, combining both direct and reasoning modes, show better performance when fine-tuned with a hybrid text foundation LLM. The research highlights the significance of introducing reasoning steps in speechLLMs and the influence of text foundation models on their performance. <div>

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models (speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models (Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech detection systems.

<div> GLiNER, PII removal, clinical notes, EHRs, LOGICAL <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces LOGICAL, a locally deployable PII removal system for clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Using a fine-tuned GLiNER model, the system efficiently removes nine categories of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical documents. The GLiNER model achieved superior performance compared to other solutions, with a high F1-score of 0.980. LOGICAL successfully sanitized 95% of documents completely on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a 2% entity-level false negative rate indicates the need for human validation. The fine-tuned GLiNER model offers an accurate and secure solution for PII removal, enabling the creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while preserving data privacy. This approach provides a practical alternative to resource-intensive Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments. <div>
arXiv:2510.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal. A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision, recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER, Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95% of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a 2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source" approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<div> Keywords: multimodal cues, turn-taking, gestures, DnD Gesture++, Mixture-of-Experts framework

Summary:
Gestures play a crucial role in human conversation, providing additional cues for turn-taking management alongside speech and gaze. The study introduces the DnD Gesture++ dataset, which includes detailed semantic annotations of gestures, such as iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. By incorporating semantically guided gestures into a Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines text, audio, and gestures, the researchers enhance turn-taking prediction accuracy. The experiments demonstrate that integrating gestures leads to consistent performance improvements over baseline models, highlighting the importance of considering gestures in multimodal turn-taking analysis. This research emphasizes the complementary nature of gestures in understanding and predicting conversational dynamics, offering valuable insights for future studies on human communication.

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset, we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

Summary:
The article introduces M3-SLU, a new benchmark for evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding in large language models. M3-SLU is created from four open corpora and consists of over 12,000 instances with audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes two tasks: Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching. Baseline results for both cascaded pipelines and end-to-end models show that while models understand the content of conversations, they struggle with identifying who said what. This highlights a gap in speaker-aware dialogue understanding. M3-SLU is designed to push research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding and offers a challenging benchmark for evaluating models' performance in this area. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000 validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said, they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Summary: 
AgenticMath introduces a novel pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach consists of four key stages: Seed Question Filter to select high-quality questions, Agentic Question Rephrase to generate diverse paraphrases, Answer Augment to improve answer correctness, and Question and Answer Evaluation to retain superior pairs. By fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets with only 30-60K samples, competitive or superior performance is achieved on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on larger datasets. The study highlights the efficiency of targeted, high-quality data generation over large-scale, low-quality alternatives in enhancing mathematical reasoning in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness, without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

<br />
Summary:
This paper introduces LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for advanced long-context reasoning. It utilizes KeyChain, a synthesis approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks by hiding the true question among distracting documents. Models trained using LoongRL exhibit an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning pattern, allowing them to solve tasks far beyond the training length. LoongRL significantly improves long-context multi-hop QA accuracy on Qwen2.5-7B and 14B datasets, rivaling larger models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1. The method also enhances long-context retrieval, passes needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and maintains short-context reasoning capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2510.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha" moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs. On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5) and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all 128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning capabilities.

Summary: 
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are enhanced through MoE-Prism, offering increased flexibility and adaptability in AI services. The Offline Refactoring Engine breaks down monolithic experts into finer sub-experts using a partitioning optimization solver, maintaining functional locality without requiring retraining. The Online Scheduling Engine utilizes this elasticity for QoS-aware scheduling, optimizing throughput in cloud deployments and managing latency in memory-constrained devices. Results across different MoE models demonstrate MoE-Prism providing over 4 times more stable operating points, enhancing AI service performance. It allows dynamic throughput improvements by up to 19.9% within a strict latency budget and reduces latency by up to 10.36% under resource constraints. MoE-Prism serves as a crucial tool in bridging the model-system gap, enabling the development of adaptive, efficient, and quality-aware AI services.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI, achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a "quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining. Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over 4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources. MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap, enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

<div> Keywords: sign language translation, gloss annotations, sentence embeddings, multilinguality, state-of-the-art

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach to sign language translation (SLT) systems that uses sentence embeddings of target sentences as a form of gloss annotations. This method eliminates the need for manual annotation and instead learns from raw textual data, making it scalable and language-independent. The approach was evaluated on datasets for German and American sign languages, showcasing its ability to handle multilinguality effectively. Results show that this approach significantly outperforms other gloss-free methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for datasets lacking gloss annotations. By closing the gap between gloss-dependent and gloss-free systems, this approach offers a promising solution for improving SLT systems in cases where gloss annotations are not readily available. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and gloss-dependent systems.

Summary: <br />
Sign language translation (SLT) faces limitations in scalability and cross-language generalization due to training with text in a single spoken language. This study introduces a novel approach using language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling direct multilingual translation. A coupled augmentation method combines multilingual target augmentations and video-level perturbations to improve model robustness in low-resource settings. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-based supervision, with larger improvements in scenarios with limited data. The results showcase the effectiveness of language-agnostic embedding supervision and coupled augmentation in providing a scalable and semantically robust alternative for training SLT models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization. Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e. translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision, combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust alternative to traditional SLT training.

<div> Keywords: mention detection, NER, language modeling, entity representations, transformer layers

Summary:
ToMMeR is a lightweight model designed for mention detection tasks, utilizing early layers of large language models (LLMs). It demonstrates high recall rates (93%) and precision rates (over 90%) in mention detection across 13 Named Entity Recognition (NER) benchmarks. The model is efficient, with fewer than 300K parameters, yet achieves near state-of-the-art NER performance when equipped with span classification heads. Cross-model analysis reveals that different architectures converge on similar mention boundaries, indicating that mention detection naturally emerges from language modeling. The study suggests that structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be retrieved effectively with minimal parameters. This research highlights the potential for leveraging LLMs for mention detection and the importance of efficient entity representation extraction for information extraction tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
1. ToMMeR, a lightweight model, excels in mention detection with high recall and precision rates.
2. The model leverages early transformer layers in LLMs for efficient entity representation retrieval.
3. Cross-model analysis demonstrates consistency in mention boundaries across diverse architectures.
4. ToMMeR achieves near SOTA performance in NER when combined with span classification heads.
5. The study underscores the significance of structured entity representations in language modeling for information extraction tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is both foundational for information extraction and a known performance bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks, ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance (80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently recovered with minimal parameters.

Summary:
This paper presents the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 task, focusing on translating Swiss German Sign Language videos into German text. The system utilizes a novel approach that incorporates spatio-temporal feature representations in a single model for better generalization. While achieving promising results of $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, the performance dropped significantly to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points on the test set. By customizing input embeddings and integrating temporal features, the proposed system aims to enhance the accuracy and fluency of sign language translation. The end-to-end architecture demonstrates the potential for improved SLT capabilities, although further refinement is necessary to address the performance disparity between the development and test sets.

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features. In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence. Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

arXiv:2510.19457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness, understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07, while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing methods in single editing scenarios.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/mbr-for-asr

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module (IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to expensive manual annotation.

<title>Machine Text Detectors are Membership Inference Attacks</title>

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability, i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments, including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

<title>What is the Best Sequence Length for BABYLM?</title>

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions, particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework, we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models. Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/huangcb01/lookahead-routing.

<title>Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19509</link>

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the \textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it. We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody, interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

<title>Conditions for Catastrophic Forgetting in Multilingual Translation</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16 cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250 diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ dataset will be publicly available for use in future work.

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages, particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable, explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news analysis and offer insights into models performance.

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

arXiv:2510.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii) effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition. Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and understanding of user behavior across various domains.

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy, low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking} phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce \textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods, our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%, establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

<title>CoSense-LLM: Semantics at the Edge with Cost- and Uncertainty-Aware Cloud-Edge Cooperation</title>

arXiv:2510.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

<title>Are Large Language Models Sensitive to the Motives Behind Communication?</title>

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world, they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner. We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving. In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge, particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers, and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension, establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive legal dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture, beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper, a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual values.

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks. However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of various large language models of different sizes.

<title>AdaSPEC: Selective Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Speculative Decoders</title>

arXiv:2510.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters. Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

<title>Adapting Multilingual Models to Code-Mixed Tasks via Model Merging</title>

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i) perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii) fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi (En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2 points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs. We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs 0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only) and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger models.

<title>ToolDreamer: Instilling LLM Reasoning Into Tool Retrievers</title>

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence, an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e., description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of tools without inundating its context window.

<title>The Art of Asking: Multilingual Prompt Optimization for Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models, yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts. This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for 12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally capable.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the ''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints, ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative 44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

<title>Hubble: a Model Suite to Advance the Study of LLM Memorization</title>

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs) for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how readily different types of private information are memorized. We also demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning (ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research, experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

<title>BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18927</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i) an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions; and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

<title>StutterZero and StutterFormer: End-to-End Speech Conversion for Stuttering Transcription and Correction</title>

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer, the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription. StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a 31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28% decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.

<title>NeuroAda: Activating Each Neuron's Potential for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former, such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e., connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen. Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here: https://github.com/FightingFighting/NeuroAda.git.

<title>PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions</title>

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr, SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable, interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics (including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus, DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type (using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as assistive text generation.

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

arXiv:2510.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, safeguarding them against unsafe, malicious, or privacy-violating content is critically important. We present OpenGuardrails, the first open-source project to provide both a context-aware safety and manipulation detection model and a deployable platform for comprehensive AI guardrails. OpenGuardrails protects against content-safety risks, model-manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking, code-interpreter abuse, and the generation/execution of malicious code), and data leakage. Content-safety and model-manipulation detection are implemented by a unified large model, while data-leakage identification and redaction are performed by a separate lightweight NER pipeline (e.g., Presidio-style models or regex-based detectors). The system can be deployed as a security gateway or an API-based service, with enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options. OpenGuardrails achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on safety benchmarks, excelling in both prompt and response classification across English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for public use.

<title>The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models</title>

arXiv:2510.19176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast, approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task.

Abstract: News spreads rapidly across languages and regions, but translations may lose subtle nuances. We propose a method to align sentences in multilingual news articles using optimal transport, identifying semantically similar content across languages. We apply this method to align more than 140,000 pairs of Bloomberg English and Japanese news articles covering around 3500 stocks in Tokyo exchange over 2012-2024. Aligned sentences are sparser, more interpretable, and exhibit higher semantic similarity. Return scores constructed from aligned sentences show stronger correlations with realized stock returns, and long-short trading strategies based on these alignments achieve 10\% higher Sharpe ratios than analyzing the full text sample.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series, specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0. Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8 operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%. Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions. Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon, robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2% and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our code is available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use.

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs. Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect, which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed, incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S (sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial, temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames), and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement, and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual, repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge. To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce $\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy. AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at $\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

<title>HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application</title>

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses, medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories, with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides, detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application, and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

<title>From Forecasting to Planning: Policy World Model for Collaborative State-Action Prediction</title>

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework, the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction, PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism, equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss. Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs. Code and model weights will be released at https://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes, intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

<title>Blackbox Model Provenance via Palimpsestic Membership Inference</title>

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to 12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive 400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a 56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training; and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale, high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models.

Abstract: We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision language model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our model, data and code under permissive open licenses.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are now claiming remarkable supported context lengths of 256k or even more. In contrast, the average context lengths of mainstream benchmarks are insufficient (5k-21k), and they suffer from potential knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics, resulting in biased evaluation. This paper introduces LV-Eval, a challenging long-context benchmark with five length levels (16k, 32k, 64k, 128k, and 256k) reaching up to 256k words. LV-Eval features two main tasks, single-hop QA and multi-hop QA, comprising 11 bilingual datasets. The design of LV-Eval has incorporated three key techniques, namely confusing facts insertion, keyword and phrase replacement, and keyword-recall-based metric design. The advantages of LV-Eval include controllable evaluation across different context lengths, challenging test instances with confusing facts, mitigated knowledge leakage, and more objective evaluations. We evaluate 15 LLMs on LV-Eval and conduct ablation studies on the benchmarking techniques. The results reveal that: (i) Moonshot-v1 and recent large-scale open-source models, such as Qwen-2.5-72B and Llama-3.1-70B, achieve the highest performance on LV-Eval, particularly at lengths below 64k. (ii) Models exhibit distinct score trends. For example, GLM-4-9B-128k, Yi-6B-200k, and Llama3-8B-1M exhibit a relatively gentle degradation of performance, but their absolute performances may not necessarily be higher than those of LLMs with shorter context lengths. (iii) LLMs' performances can significantly degrade in the presence of confusing information, especially in the pressure test of "needle in a haystack". (iv) Issues related to knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics introduce bias in evaluation, and these concerns are alleviated in LV-Eval. All datasets and evaluation codes are released at: https://github.com/infinigence/LVEval.

<title>LASeR: Learning to Adaptively Select Reward Models with Multi-Armed Bandits</title>

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the degree to which an RM specialized to one task (e.g. writing) generalizes to new tasks (e.g. math) is often not known a priori, often making using only one fixed RM to train LLMs suboptimal. However, optimizing LLMs with multiple RMs simultaneously can incur a prohibitively high computational cost and lead to conflicting signals from different RMs that may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LASeR (Learning to Adaptively Select Rewards), which frames reward model selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, efficiently and iteratively training LLMs using multiple RMs by selecting the most well-suited RM for each instance. On commonsense and math reasoning tasks, we show that LASeR boosts iterative LLM training, improving the absolute average accuracy of Llama-3-8B over three datasets by 2.67% over an ensemble of RM scores while also showing superior efficiency (e.g., a 2x speedup). Moreover, on WildChat (open-ended instruction-following tasks), LASeR leads to a 72.69% AlpacaEval win rate over the RM score ensemble baseline. Extending to long-context generation, LASeR improves by 2.96 F1 points (avg.) on single-document QA tasks and 2.97 F1 points on few-shot learning over the RM score ensemble baseline with best-of-n sampling.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized product recommenders, yet their susceptibility to adversarial manipulation poses critical challenges, particularly in real-world commercial applications. Our approach is the first one to tap into human psychological principles, seamlessly modifying product descriptions, making such manipulations hard to detect. In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.

Abstract: We introduce Spire, a speech-augmented language model (LM) capable of both translating and transcribing speech input from English into 10 other languages as well as translating text input in both language directions. Spire integrates the speech modality into an existing multilingual LM via speech discretization and continued pre-training using only 42.5K hours of speech. In particular, we adopt the pretraining framework of multilingual LMs and treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. This approach not only equips the model with speech capabilities, but also preserves its strong text-based performance. We achieve this using significantly less data than existing speech LMs, demonstrating that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LM adaptation. We make our code and models available to the community.

Abstract: This paper establishes a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess eight commercial LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 4, Claude Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 and o4-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks in four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test rejection accuracy. We develop a LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference solutions. Results show o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieve the best overall performance, OpenAI's GPT-4.1, GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview do not fall far behind, but the last two are more efficient in identifying unsolvable tasks. Claude Sonnet 4, due its preference to provide any solution rather than reject a task, proved to be less accurate. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources (available at https://github.com/Solirinai/GeoBenchX), providing one more standardized method for the ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), particularly through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances LLM capabilities by integrating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems face critical limitations, including disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking, and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval. To address these issues, we propose CausalRAG, a novel framework that incorporates causal graphs into the retrieval process. By constructing and tracing causal relationships, CausalRAG preserves contextual continuity and improves retrieval precision, leading to more accurate and interpretable responses. We evaluate CausalRAG against regular RAG and graph-based RAG approaches, demonstrating its superiority across several metrics. Our findings suggest that grounding retrieval in causal reasoning provides a promising approach to knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.

Abstract: In recent developments, deep learning methodologies applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revealed a paradox: They improve performance but demand considerable data and resources for their training. Alternatively, quantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to overcome the computational limitations of current methodologies, thereby establishing an emerging field known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). This domain holds the potential to attain a quantum advantage in the processing of linguistic structures, surpassing classical models in both efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, it is proposed to categorise QNLP models based on quantum computing principles, architecture, and computational approaches. This paper attempts to provide a survey on how quantum meets language by mapping state-of-the-art in this area, embracing quantum encoding techniques for classical data, QNLP models for prevalent NLP tasks, and quantum optimisation techniques for hyper parameter tuning. The landscape of quantum computing approaches applied to various NLP tasks is summarised by showcasing the specific QNLP methods used, and the popularity of these methods is indicated by their count. From the findings, it is observed that QNLP approaches are still limited to small data sets, with only a few models explored extensively, and there is increasing interest in the application of quantum computing to natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks -- not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA (LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model. We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for Qwen2.5. The LCB dataset is available publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Steefano/LCB and the codebase to replicate the work on this paper at https://github.com/Zteefano/long-code-bench.

Abstract: Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks, modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.

However, the highly diverse, complex, and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content, thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this field.

Abstract: In recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has become integral to educational data mining, particularly in the analysis of student-generated language products. For research and assessment purposes, so-called embedding models are typically employed to generate numeric representations of text that capture its semantic content for use in subsequent quantitative analyses. Yet when it comes to science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address. Existing research studies and practical applications often either overlook these challenges or remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased research findings and diminished performance of practical applications. This study therefore explores how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches: 1) similarity-based analyses and 2) integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Overall, this study underscores the importance for educational data mining researchers and practitioners of carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related language products that include symbolic expressions.

<title>metaTextGrad: Automatically optimizing language model optimizers</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms, evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations, predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best baseline.

<title>Do LLMs Really Forget? Evaluating Unlearning with Knowledge Correlation and Confidence Awareness</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study, we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations from the encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on several downstream tasks, with usually only a minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more broadly applicable.

Abstract: Textless spoken language models (SLMs) are generative models of speech that do not rely on text supervision. Most textless SLMs learn to predict the next semantic token, a discrete representation of linguistic content, and rely on a separate vocoder to add acoustic information to the generated speech. Such models have no access to acoustic context and no built-in control over acoustic details. In this work, we propose to jointly model linguistic and acoustic information by generating semantic tokens and a continuous real-valued representation of the acoustic frame. We use a flow-matching objective to predict the continuous vector conditioned on the semantic tokens. We study the design space of this approach and find that predicting multiple future semantic tokens helps preserve linguistic information. Our approach achieves comparable performance to existing models in terms of linguistic likelihood benchmarks, while providing better acoustic detail in prompted generation.

Abstract: Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing, dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach ~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost, and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhangYiqun018/AvengersPro.

<title>Who's Asking? Investigating Bias Through the Lens of Disability Framed Queries in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Word2VecT/Middo.

<title>Evaluation Framework for Highlight Explanations of Context Utilisation in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate relevant information from the provided context when generating responses, remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation explanations at scale.

Abstract: We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers, BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and cyber threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. Prior work shows that LLMs maintain internal uncertainty signals, yet their expressed confidence is often miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect answers. We investigate whether supervised fine-tuning can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We fine-tune LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation, where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more likely to answer correctly. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including medical and legal reasoning. Results show that fine-tuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains. However, gains are task-specific: training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise comparison, and vice versa. Multitask fine-tuning yields broader gains, lowering calibration error and strengthening discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. This suggests that uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable but requires multitask training to generalize effectively.

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment, making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality}, built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides, videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels, supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice. To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias. Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures, overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Abstract: This paper introduces a general method for the exploration of equivalence classes in the input space of Transformer models. The proposed approach is based on sound mathematical theory which describes the internal layers of a Transformer architecture as sequential deformations of the input manifold. Using eigendecomposition of the pullback of the distance metric defined on the output space through the Jacobian of the model, we are able to reconstruct equivalence classes in the input space and navigate across them. Our method enables two complementary exploration procedures: the first retrieves input instances that produce the same class probability distribution as the original instance-thus identifying elements within the same equivalence class-while the second discovers instances that yield a different class probability distribution, effectively navigating toward distinct equivalence classes. Finally, we demonstrate how the retrieved instances can be meaningfully interpreted by projecting their embeddings back into a human-readable format.

Abstract: Previous research has explored the computational expressivity of Transformer models in simulating Boolean circuits or Turing machines. However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in trainable parameters. But, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not. Further, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and find its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by causally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated singular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover, scaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training distribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we should expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more forgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of sequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder dimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the practicality of our findings.

Abstract: Recent agentic language models increasingly need to interact with real-world environments that contain tightly intertwined visual and textual information, often through raw camera pixels rather than separately processed images and tokenized text. This shift highlights the need for a unified perception paradigm. To investigate this idea, we explore Perceive Everything as Pixels (PEAP) and introduce PixelWorld, a benchmark that renders natural-language, tabular, mathematical, and diagrammatic inputs into a shared pixel space. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that PEAP achieves comparable performance to token-based approaches on semantic understanding tasks, suggesting that vision transformers can partially capture global textual semantics without explicit tokenization. In contrast, reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and code show notable performance degradation, although Chain-of-Thought prompting helps mitigate this gap by compensating for missing symbolic structure. We further find that when visual and textual information are closely integrated, representing everything as pixels simplifies preprocessing and avoids cross-modal misalignment. PixelWorld thus provides a systematic and practical framework for evaluating unified vision--language models and facilitates further exploration of pixel-based multimodal learning.

Abstract: Writing is a cognitively demanding activity that requires constant decision-making, heavy reliance on working memory, and frequent shifts between tasks of different goals. To build writing assistants that truly align with writers' cognition, we must capture and decode the complete thought process behind how writers transform ideas into final texts. We present ScholaWrite, the first dataset of end-to-end scholarly writing, tracing the multi-month journey from initial drafts to final manuscripts. We contribute three key advances: (1) a Chrome extension that unobtrusively records keystrokes on Overleaf, enabling the collection of realistic, in-situ writing data; (2) a novel corpus of full scholarly manuscripts, enriched with fine-grained annotations of cognitive writing intentions. The dataset includes \LaTeX-based edits from five computer science preprints, capturing nearly 62K text changes over four months; and (3) analyses and insights into the micro-dynamics of scholarly writing, highlighting gaps between human writing processes and the current capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in providing meaningful assistance. ScholaWrite underscores the value of capturing end-to-end writing data to develop future writing assistants that support, not replace, the cognitive work of scientists.

<title>Using (Not-so) Large Language Models to Generate Simulation Models in a Formal DSL: A Study on Reaction Networks</title>

Abstract: Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-efficient, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.

Abstract: We introduce the task of grounded article generation with the goal of creating a Wikipedia-style article from multiple diverse videos about real-world events -- from natural disasters to political elections -- where all the information in the article is supported by video evidence. Videos are intuitive sources for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but most contemporary RAG workflows focus heavily on text while existing methods for video-based summarization focus on low-level scene understanding rather than high-level event semantics. To close this gap, we introduce WikiVideo, a benchmark consisting of expert-written articles and densely annotated videos that provide evidence for articles' claims, facilitating the integration of video into RAG pipelines and enabling the creation of in-depth content that is grounded in multimodal sources. We further propose Collaborative Article Generation (CAG), a novel interactive method for article creation from multiple videos. CAG leverages an iterative interaction between an r1-style reasoning model and a VideoLLM to draw higher-level inferences about the target event than is possible with VideoLLMs alone, which fixate on low-level visual features. We benchmark state-of-the-art VideoLLMs and CAG in both oracle retrieval and RAG settings and find that CAG consistently outperforms alternative methods, while suggesting intriguing avenues for future work.

<title>Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.08727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation, we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2 pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation - paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.

<title>InfiFPO: Implicit Model Fusion via Preference Optimization in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs from source models while discarding their probability information. To address this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

arXiv:2505.14489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that reasoning models that engage in extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the 36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models (e.g., exploring alternative approaches and backtracking) which enable them to adjust their confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that non-reasoning models also demonstrate enhanced calibration when simply guided to slow think via in-context learning, fully isolating slow thinking as the source of the calibration gains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

<title>Unlearned but Not Forgotten: Data Extraction after Exact Unlearning in LLM</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24379</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are typically trained on datasets collected from the web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information. To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard for mitigating privacy risks in deployment. In this paper, we revisit this assumption in a practical deployment setting where both the pre- and post-unlearning logits API are exposed, such as in open-weight scenarios. Targeting this setting, we introduce a novel data extraction attack that leverages signals from the pre-unlearning model to guide the post-unlearning model, uncovering patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage during real-world deployments, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Nicholas0228/unlearned_data_extraction_llm.

Abstract: Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

<title>GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.10946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlearning in large language models is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this problem, we propose GUARD, a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the alignment between the Forget and Retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended retention loss. We also provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly improves retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the TOFU Retain Set by up to 194.92 percent in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10 percent of the training data, and improves knowledge retention on the MUSE NEWS Retain Set by 16.20 percent, with comparable or very moderate increases in privacy loss compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Flexible-length Text Infilling for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling), the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements in training efficiency and flexibility.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.

arXiv:2508.00890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model (LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought (CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination, yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text. Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels, enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning. Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and evaluation scripts are publicly available at: https://github.com/githshine/SynGuard.

The research evaluates lightweight methods for classifying medical abstracts, focusing on maximizing performance within financial constraints. BERT base and Distil BERT models were fine-tuned using different loss functions on a public medical abstract corpus. DistilBERT with plain cross entropy showed the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, further refinement through post hoc operating point selection, such as validation calibration and classwise thresholds, significantly enhanced deployment performance. This tuning particularly benefited the focal loss function. The study reports on accuracy, macro F1, and weighted F1 metrics, and includes confusion analyses to identify error patterns. The practical recommendation is to start with a compact encoder and cross entropy loss, adding lightweight calibration or thresholding for improved macro balance in deployment scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The research evaluates lightweight medical abstract classification methods to establish their maximum performance capabilities under financial budget restrictions. On the public medical abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and Distil BERT with three objectives cross entropy (CE), class weighted CE, and focal loss under identical tokenization, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule. DistilBERT with plain CE gives the strongest raw argmax trade off, while a post hoc operating point selection (validation calibrated, classwise thresholds) sub stantially improves deployed performance; under this tuned regime, focal benefits most. We report Accuracy, Macro F1, and WeightedF1, release evaluation artifacts, and include confusion analyses to clarify error structure. The practical takeaway is to start with a compact encoder and CE, then add lightweight calibration or thresholding when deployment requires higher macro balance.

<div> Keywords: emotion, large language models, fairness, altruistic punishment, decision-making<br />
Summary:<br />
This study explores how large language models (LLMs) and humans use emotion to guide altruistic third-party punishment decisions. LLMs exhibited similar emotional responses to unfairness as humans, leading to increased punishment. However, LLMs prioritized emotion over cost, enforcing norms in a binary manner with reduced sensitivity to costs. Humans, on the other hand, balanced fairness and cost in their decisions. Reasoning models displayed more cost sensitivity and behavior closer to humans than foundation models but remained primarily driven by emotion. The study suggests that LLMs progress through a trajectory resembling human development and highlights the importance of integrating emotion with context-sensitive reasoning for LLMs to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100 decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting; and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost, enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity, whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven. These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like emotional intelligence.

<title>POPI: Personalizing LLMs via Optimized Natural Language Preference Inference</title>

<div> Keywords: Large language models, personalization, preference inference, generation model, reinforcement learning

Summary:
The article introduces a framework called POPI that aims to improve personalization in large language models (LLMs). Existing techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook individual preferences. POPI addresses this by using a preference inference model to distill user signals into concise summaries, which are then used to personalize responses. The framework optimizes both preference inference and personalized generation through reinforcement learning, ensuring that the summaries contain relevant preference information. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that POPI enhances personalization accuracy while reducing context overhead significantly. Additionally, the optimized summaries can be easily transferred to existing LLMs for seamless plug-and-play personalization without requiring weight updates.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play personalization without weight updates.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase in scientific literature and online information necessitates efficient methods for extracting knowledge from textual data. Natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in addressing this challenge, particularly in text classification tasks. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in NLP, their accuracy can suffer in domain-specific contexts due to specialized vocabulary, unique grammatical structures, and imbalanced data distributions. In this systematic literature review (SLR), we investigate the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for domain-specific text classification. We systematically review 41 articles published between 2018 and January 2024, adhering to the PRISMA statement (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). This review methodology involved rigorous inclusion criteria and a multi-step selection process employing AI-powered tools. We delve into the evolution of text classification techniques and differentiate between traditional and modern approaches. We emphasize transformer-based models and explore the challenges and considerations associated with using LLMs for domain-specific text classification. Furthermore, we categorize existing research based on various PLMs and propose a taxonomy of techniques used in the field. To validate our findings, we conducted a comparative experiment involving BERT, SciBERT, and BioBERT in biomedical sentence classification. Finally, we present a comparative study on the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks across different domains. In addition, we examine recent advancements in PLMs for domain-specific text classification and offer insights into future directions and limitations in this rapidly evolving domain.

<div> neurons, literary style, GPT-2, Herman Melville, ablation <br />
Summary: <br />
This study analyzes the literary style in GPT-2 by identifying neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and AI-generated text using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus. They find 27,122 neurons that statistically discriminate between the texts. Surprisingly, ablating these high-discriminating neurons leads to a 25.7% improvement in literary style metrics, contradicting the initial correlation. This reveals a gap between neuronal activation and the actual output during generation in neural networks. The study challenges the assumption that activating neurons producing desirable inputs will guarantee desired outputs, impacting interpretability research and AI alignment efforts. <div>
arXiv:2510.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mechanistic analysis of literary style in GPT-2, identifying individual neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and rigid AI-generated text. Using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus, we extract activation patterns from 355 million parameters across 32,768 neurons in late layers. We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50 high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style metrics. This demonstrates a critical gap between observational correlation and causal necessity in neural networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that neurons which activate on desirable inputs will produce those outputs during generation, with implications for mechanistic interpretability research and AI alignment.

<div> pre-training data, large language models, safety, trustworthiness, world context<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper addresses the challenges of hallucination and credibility in large language models (LLMs) by focusing on enhancing pre-training data. It is noted that unsafe and hallucinations in LLMs originate from pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism. The proposal suggests enhancing pre-training data with world context information to anchor it within real-world scenarios, reducing uncertainty in model training and improving safety and trustworthiness. The approach involves incorporating a substantial amount of data reflecting industrial scenarios and enhancing data with context to better represent real-world knowledge. By pre-training a model with 1.5 trillion Data with World Context (DWC) tokens and implementing post-training procedures, the JT-Safe-35B model shows a performance improvement of 1.79% on Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks compared to similar models, despite being pretrained with fewer tokens. <div>
arXiv:2510.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs) are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training, involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism. In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

<div> method, creativity assessment, mathematical solutions, reinforcement learning, large language models 

Summary: 
The article introduces CLAWS, a method developed to assess the creativity of mathematical solutions generated by large language models trained with reinforcement learning. Traditional assessment methods for reasoning tasks have focused on accuracy rather than creativity. CLAWS overcomes the challenges of defining creativity and requiring human evaluation by classifying solutions into typical, creative, and hallucinated categories based on attention weights. It outperforms existing detection methods on 7-8B math RL models and is validated on a large dataset of math problems from various contests. This approach paves the way for a new perspective on assessing creativity in reasoning tasks, offering a more comprehensive evaluation of large language model performance. <div>
arXiv:2510.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) have been remarkably successful. LLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning demonstrate strong performance in challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, even with relatively small model sizes. However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks, in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal). We validate CLAWS on 4545 math problems collected from 181 math contests (AJHSME, AMC, AIME).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition. Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition: categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and cost.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities in noisy spoken-language data. By jointly fine-tuning a BERT model on standard entities and new pattern-based PII, minimal degradation for original classes is observed, indicating "peaceful coexistence." Through incremental learning, the researchers identify two key insights. Firstly, the LOC entity is vulnerable due to overlap with new PII patterns. Secondly, a "reverse O-tag representation drift" is discovered, highlighting the need to unfreeze the 'O' tag's classifier for adaptation. The study provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation, emphasizing feature independence, representation overlap issues, and the importance of 'O' tag plasticity in facilitating learning.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII (EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.
  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation, highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag plasticity.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a parametric knowledge integration method called AtlasKV, which aims to augment large language models (LLMs) with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) in a scalable and efficient manner. Unlike existing non-parametric methods that rely on external retrieval modules, AtlasKV integrates KG triples into LLMs with sub-linear time and memory complexity, using GPU memory efficiently. It does not require external retrievers or long context priors, making it suitable for adapting to new knowledge without the need for retraining. The method, utilizing LLMs' attention mechanism, maintains strong knowledge grounding and generalization performance. In summary, AtlasKV presents a novel approach to incorporating vast amounts of external knowledge into LLMs while minimizing inference latency and memory usage. <div>
arXiv:2510.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior. Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism, and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when adapting to new knowledge.

Summary:
belief depth framework developed to measure success of knowledge editing techniques in large language models. Criteria include extent of implanted knowledge generalizing, withstanding scrutiny/challenge, and resembling genuine knowledge. Simple techniques less successful than Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF), which can implant beliefs resembling genuine knowledge but with exceptions for beliefs contradicting basic world knowledge. SDF's success not universal, with some implanted beliefs being brittle. Overall, criteria for belief depth introduced to enable rigorous evaluation of knowledge editing for real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast, Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal, as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world applications.

<div> Framework, Benchmark, Language models, Evaluation, Dataset <br />

SimBA is a three-phase framework proposed to simplify the analysis of large language model benchmarks. The three phases include stalk, where dataset and model comparisons are conducted, prowl, where a representative subset is discovered, and pounce, where performance on a held-out set of models is predicted. When applied to popular LM benchmarks HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite, SimBA reveals strong relationships between datasets and models. An algorithm for discovering a representative set using raw evaluation scores alone proves effective, achieving high coverage levels with minimal datasets. Using these representative subsets, model ranks can be preserved, and performance on new models can be accurately predicted. SimBA can assist model developers in improving efficiency during training and help dataset creators validate differences in new datasets compared to existing benchmarks. The open-source code for SimBA is available on GitHub. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk, where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk). We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25% (1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl). Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.

<div> keyword: multilingual watermarking, large language model, cross-lingual robustness, translation attacks, STEAM 

Summary:
Multilingual watermarking aims to trace large language model outputs across languages, but current methods are not truly multilingual and lack robustness in medium- and low-resource languages. This is due to semantic clustering issues caused by a limited tokenizer vocabulary. To counteract this, STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method, is introduced to restore watermark strength lost during translation attacks. STEAM is versatile, works with any watermarking method, and is resilient across various tokenizers and languages. It offers significant improvements in performance on 17 languages, with an average increase in AUC and TPR@1%. By providing a simple and robust solution, STEAM paves the way for fairer watermarking practices across a diverse range of languages.

arXiv:2510.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17 languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking across diverse languages.

<div> pruning, language models, structured, attention heads, calibration
Summary: 
Structured pruning is a method to make large language models efficient by removing certain components. However, traditional local pruning methods often fail to fully leverage task-specific signals, leading to limited improvements. In this study, the global iterative structured pruning (GISP) approach is introduced, which removes attention heads and MLP channels based on importance weights calculated at the structure level. The iterative pruning schedule stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity levels and supports a "prune-once, deploy-many" workflow. GISP also considers task-specific objectives, such as perplexity for language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks. Experimental results across various models show that GISP consistently reduces perplexity and enhances downstream accuracy, particularly at 40-50% sparsity. Task-aligned calibration further increases exact-match accuracy in specific scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures. However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory also forms nested subnetworks that support a "prune-once, deploy-many" workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss, GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks. Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.

By generating auxiliary signals like inferred usage scenarios and item intents, LaMAR enhances the original sequences and improves performance in modeling tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically. LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks, where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators, contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and language resources.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Translation, Inter-sentential Dependencies, DiscEvalMT, Reasoning 

Summary: 
This paper evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate texts with inter-sentential dependencies, focusing on challenges like pronominal anaphora and lexical cohesion. 12 LLMs from various families are tested on distinguishing correct translations from wrong but plausible ones and generating correct translations using the English-French DiscEvalMT benchmark. Models that incorporate chain-of-thought reasoning perform better, with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Phi showing superior performance. There is also a "wise get wiser" effect, where models benefit from reasoning, and improvements correlate with initial model scores. The best models achieve around 90% accuracy in distinguishing correct translations and COMET scores of about 92% in generating correct translations. <div>

Abstract: This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion. We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models without reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, problem difficulty, generalization, reinforcement learning, linear probes

Summary: Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency in solving complex problems while failing on seemingly simpler ones. This study investigates how these models encode problem difficulty internally and whether this aligns with human judgment. Linear probes were trained on various models and evaluated on mathematical and coding subsets to analyze Easy2HardBench. Results show that human-labeled difficulty is linearly decodable and scales with model size, while LLM-derived difficulty is weaker and scales poorly. Steering models towards "easier" representations reduces hallucinations and improves accuracy. During reinforcement learning post-training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, human-difficulty probes strengthen and positively correlate with test accuracy, while LLM-difficulty probes degrade and negatively correlate with performance. This implies that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that reinforcement learning amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates from model performance become misaligned as models improve. The released probe code and evaluation scripts aim to facilitate replication.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling, whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly. Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward "easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

<div> keywords: mechanistic interpretability, rule-based descriptions, attention layers, transformer, GPT-2

Summary:
This paper proposes a new approach to interpretability in machine learning models, focusing on rule-based descriptions extracted from attention layers in transformers. Instead of relying on sparse linear combinations of features, the authors advocate for rule-based descriptions that match token patterns in the input. Three types of rules are identified: skip-gram rules, absence rules, and counting rules. By applying this approach to GPT-2 small, the authors find that a majority of features can be described well with skip-gram rules, while absence rules are abundant even in the first layer. This work lays the foundation for future research on rule-based descriptions in machine learning models, providing a preliminary taxonomy of behaviors represented by these rules. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Introduces a new approach to interpretability in machine learning models
- Proposes rule-based descriptions extracted from attention layers in transformers
- Identifies three types of rules: skip-gram, absence, and counting rules
- Applies the approach to GPT-2 small and extracts meaningful rule-based descriptions
- Lays the groundwork for future research on rule-based interpretations of model features <div>
arXiv:2510.18148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars. This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form "[Canadian city]... speaks --> English", (2) absence rules of the form "[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word. Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small. We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100 skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they represent.

Summary:
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in maximizing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs). This study introduces a method that automatically selects and generates high-quality prompts based on users' task descriptions. By creating a knowledge base that associates task clusters with specific prompting techniques, the system dynamically generates prompts tailored to the task at hand. The experimental evaluation on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) shows significant improvement over standard prompts and existing automatic prompt-generation tools. This approach simplifies and standardizes prompt creation, allowing non-experts to effectively utilize LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques. When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage LLMs.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by LLM-driven text-to-table systems in reasoning over temporal narratives to generate dynamic tables. A diagnostic benchmark called CMT-Bench is introduced, which tests robustness through extractive-cue ablation, temporal prefixing, and entity-form perturbations. Results show significant drops in performance without extractive summaries, degradation with input length, and consistent accuracy drops under entity-form changes. Distributional tests reveal shifts in numeric error patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than noise. This suggests that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic text-to-table generation and highlights the need for robustness-first evaluation in developing efficient approaches for this task. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats, which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information. We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization, outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes. Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation, motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores from a specified range without any references. We first show that this challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias, i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges, preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score ranges.

Abstract: Character arcs are important theoretical devices employed in literary studies to understand character journeys, identify tropes across literary genres, and establish similarities between narratives. This work addresses the novel task of computationally generating event-centric, relation-based character arcs from narratives. Providing a quantitative representation for arcs brings tangibility to a theoretical concept and paves the way for subsequent applications. We present MARCUS (Modelling Arcs for Understanding Stories), an NLP pipeline that extracts events, participant characters, implied emotion, and sentiment to model inter-character relations. MARCUS tracks and aggregates these relations across the narrative to generate character arcs as graphical plots. We generate character arcs from two extended fantasy series, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. We evaluate our approach before outlining existing challenges, suggesting applications of our pipeline, and discussing future work.

Summary:<br />
Prompt Optimization is vital for steering Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks. Existing methods rely on LLMs' random rewriting, leading to local optima. The performance of optimized prompts is often unstable. To address this, DelvePO is introduced as a task-agnostic framework for prompt optimization. It decouples prompts into components for exploring different task influences. Working memory is employed to guide prompt generation and mitigate LLM uncertainties. Extensive experiments on various tasks show DelvePO outperforms prior methods consistently, proving its effectiveness and transferability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$ ($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini. Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and transferability across different tasks.

Summary:
Large language models can now process visual inputs like images of text. The study explores the use of visual text representations as a form of input compression for decoder language models. By rendering long text inputs as a single image, the model requires a dramatically reduced number of tokens for decoding. Experiments on RULER and CNN/DailyMail benchmarks show that this text-as-image approach results in significant token savings, often close to half, without undermining task performance. This method offers a new way to compress textual inputs while maintaining model efficacy. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

The study focuses on addressing challenges in Braille information processing for visually impaired individuals, such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. To support diverse research in the Braille domain, the authors construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with mathematical formulas.

We construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks, we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research.

<br />
Summary: Food insecurity in the United States is a persistent public health emergency, intertwined with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid misuse. Existing food retrieval systems are inadequate, leading to fragmented access for vulnerable populations. To address this, Food4All is introduced as a multi-agent framework specifically designed for real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. It aggregates data from various sources, utilizes a reinforcement learning algorithm for optimization, and incorporates an online feedback loop to adapt to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic analysis, and decision support, Food4All aims to deliver nutritionally annotated guidance at the point of need. This framework represents a crucial step towards scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations facing food insecurity and its associated health risks. <div>

Abstract: Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United States, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid misuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries, access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases, community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.

<div> Keywords: Medical question answering, large language models, external knowledge retrieval, knowledge-grounded reasoning, unified retrieval-generation framework

Summary: <br /><br />Medical question answering requires access to domain-specific knowledge, which can be retrieved from medical corpora or stored in model parameters. Existing approaches, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), have limitations in terms of noisy retrieval or inaccurate generation. In response to these challenges, the proposed MedRGAG framework integrates external and parametric knowledge for medical QA. It includes the Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC) module, which helps generate background documents based on retrieved knowledge, and the Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS) module, which selects the most relevant documents for reasoning. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, MedRGAG shows significant improvement over existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive reasoning. The code and data are available publicly for further exploration and development. <div>

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules: Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5% improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MedRGAG

Summary:
Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare applications, especially in electrocardiography. The study examined optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies, and performance of finetuned models compared to general-purpose models. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B performed well in multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics, ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human experts preferred Claude 3.7 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for complex queries. Finetuned models outperformed base models in various evaluation modes, highlighting the effectiveness of domain-specific adaptation. The study revealed performance differences across evaluation methodologies, emphasizing assessment complexity. Despite this, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG showed competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the potential for privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

Abstract: Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies, and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized. We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7 as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics, ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity. Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces HYDRE, a Hybrid Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction framework that combines a DSRE model with in-context learning using large language models. It addresses the challenge of noisy annotations by leveraging dynamic exemplar retrieval to extract reliable training data for LLM prompts. HYDRE is extended to cross-lingual settings for relation extraction in low-resource languages, demonstrating significant improvements in both English and four Indic languages. Results show up to 20 F1 point gains in English and an average of 17 F1 points in Indic languages over previous state-of-the-art DSRE models. Ablation studies highlight HYDRE's effectiveness compared to other prompting strategies. <div>

Abstract: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to noisy annotation.
  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the final relation(s).
  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's efficacy compared to other prompting strategies.

Abstract: In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely, expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma 3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality, emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory ecosystem.

Summary:
Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA) is introduced as a benchmark to assess factuality in large language models (LLMs), focusing on Korean cultural knowledge. The dataset comprises 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with clear answers, challenging LLMs. Evaluation of various open-source LLMs supporting Korean reveals that the highest-performing model achieves a correct answer rate of only 33.7%, emphasizing the difficulty of KoSimpleQA. Performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ notably from those on English SimpleQA, highlighting the dataset's unique value. Analyzing reasoning LLMs demonstrates that integrating reasoning abilities in factual question-answering tasks can enhance models' knowledge extraction and decision-making when uncertain. KoSimpleQA provides a valuable resource for improving LLMs' understanding of Korean cultural facts and enhancing their factual question-answering capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present $\textbf{Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA)}$, a benchmark for evaluating factuality in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on Korean cultural knowledge. KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade, consisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of varying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model generates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging nature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ substantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value of our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging reasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better elicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when uncertain.

Summary: 
This work focuses on developing fair English automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for second-language speakers. Analysis of existing ASR models, Whisper and Seamless-M4T, shows significant disparities in word error rates across 26 accent groups, highlighting fairness issues. To address this, the study proposes fairness-driven finetuning with lightweight adapters, integrating techniques like Spectral Decoupling, Group Distributionally Robust Optimization, and Invariant Risk Minimization. By combining traditional empirical risk minimization with fairness objectives, the proposed approach significantly improves fairness across accent groups while maintaining recognition accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of building fair English ASR systems for second-language speakers. Our analysis of widely used ASR models, Whisper and Seamless-M4T, reveals large fluctuations in word error rate (WER) across 26 accent groups, indicating significant fairness gaps. To mitigate this, we propose fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Our proposed fusion of traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and fairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of macro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of 58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and 7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with cross-entropy loss.

<div> framework, RL, teacher-guided distillation, generalization, strategic competence

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called MENTOR that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with teacher-guided distillation to improve the tool-using capabilities of small language models (SLMs). Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods that imitate static teacher trajectories, MENTOR uses RL-based exploration to learn a more generalizable policy. Additionally, MENTOR addresses the issue of reward sparsity by constructing a dense, composite teacher-guided reward based on a teacher's reference trajectory. Experimental results show that MENTOR enhances cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to traditional SFT and standard sparse-reward RL approaches. <div>
arXiv:2510.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation, MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL baselines.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, sparse attention, Adamas, long-context inference, efficiency

Summary:
Adamas is a new sparse attention mechanism designed for large language models with extended context windows. It addresses the issue of latency in autoregressive decoding by using the Hadamard transform, bucketization, and 2-bit compression to create compact representations. Leveraging Manhattan-distance estimation, Adamas efficiently selects top-k key-value pairs, ensuring high accuracy in recalling critical information for each query. Compared to prior methods, Adamas achieves up to 8 times higher sparsity while maintaining near-lossless performance. It offers significant speedups, with up to 4.4 times faster self-attention and 1.5 times faster end-to-end processing on 32K-length sequences. Impressively, Adamas matches or even surpasses the perplexity of full attention, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under aggressive sparsity constraints.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value (KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform, bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections. Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to 8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences. Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under aggressive sparsity.

<div> Keywords: Chain-of-Thought, Chain of Conceptual Thought, LLM, reasoning tasks, emotional support<br />
Summary:<br />
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has shown limitations in open-domain tasks due to the lack of defined reasoning steps. To address this, a new prompt-based paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT) is proposed. In CoCT, the LLM first identifies a concept and then generates detailed content, allowing for deep and strategic thinking. Experimental results in daily and emotional support conversations demonstrate that CoCT outperforms existing baselines like Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT, and RAG. This suggests that CoCT could be an effective prompt-based paradigm for a broader range of tasks. CoCT's ability to tag concepts, including emotions, strategies, and topics, enhances the LLM's performance and overall capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2510.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to improve the LLM capability in math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic, human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider scope of tasks.

<div> reliability measure, hallucination, sign language translation, visual grounding, multimodal generation<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Hallucination in vision-language models, particularly in sign language translation (SLT), remains a significant issue due to the lack of precise grounding in video. The proposed token-level reliability measure aims to quantify the reliance of the decoder on visual information, distinguishing between grounded and guessed tokens. Results from evaluations on SLT benchmarks show that reliability is predictive of hallucination rates, generalizable across datasets and model architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. The measure also improves hallucination risk estimation when combined with text-based signals. The findings suggest that gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations as they lack intermediate gloss supervision for alignment. This work contributes a practical tool for diagnosing hallucinations in SLT and sets the foundation for more robust hallucination detection in multimodal generation. <div>
arXiv:2510.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks (PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together, our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

<div> humor generation, large language models, harmful content, stereotypicality, toxicity
Summary:
Large language models are being used for humor generation and creative writing, but concerns about harmful content have arisen. This study evaluates humor generation in modern language models by measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. It finds that harmful outputs often receive higher humor scores and that the use of role-based prompting can amplify bias. Information-theoretic analyses show that harmful cues can increase predictability and widen uncertainty, suggesting embedded structural biases. Testing the models on satire generation tasks, it is found that language models increase stereotypicality and toxicity in their outputs. Stereotypical and toxic jokes gain higher humor scores, appear more frequently among funny jokes, and are perceived as funny by humans. This study highlights the potential risks of using large language models for humor generation and the importance of considering biases in their outputs. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for creative writing and engagement content, raising safety concerns about the outputs. Therefore, casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\%$ in mean humor score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\%$ to $28\%$ more often among the jokes marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\%$ more often in generations perceived as funny by humans.

Summary:
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are becoming increasingly important in dynamic domains like online gaming, but the lack of a dedicated benchmark has hindered standardized evaluation. The challenge lies in the Dual Dynamics of game content updates and player community shifts. To address this, the ChronoPlay framework is introduced to automate the continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. It tracks changes in game content and player focus, synthesizing questions from official sources and player input to ensure accuracy and authenticity. By applying ChronoPlay to three distinct games, a dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain is created, providing valuable insights into model performance in realistic conditions. The code for ChronoPlay is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- RAG systems are crucial in dynamic domains, such as online gaming
- Lack of a benchmark hinders standardized evaluation
- ChronoPlay framework addresses Dual Dynamics challenge
- Tracks game content updates and player community shifts
- Creates a dynamic RAG benchmark for gaming domain <div>
arXiv:2510.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions.

<div> Keywords: Transformer models, feature attribution, interpretability, DePass, information flow

Summary: 
DePass is a novel framework designed to attribute the behavior of Transformer models by decomposing hidden states into customized additive components and propagating them using fixed attention scores and MLP activations. This approach allows for fine-grained and faithful attribution without the need for additional training. The framework has been successfully validated in various attribution tasks, including token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level attributions, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. DePass shows promise in attributing information flow between different components of Transformer models without compromising interpretability. Ultimately, DePass aims to provide a foundational tool for broader applications in enhancing the interpretability of Transformer models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attributing the behavior of Transformer models to internal computations is a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce DePass, a unified framework for feature attribution based on a single decomposed forward pass. DePass decomposes hidden states into customized additive components, then propagates them with attention scores and MLP's activations fixed. It achieves faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. Our experiments highlight its potential to attribute information flow between arbitrary components of a Transformer model. We hope DePass serves as a foundational tool for broader applications in interpretability.

Summary: 
The study introduces a WordNet annotated with CEFR levels to aid second-language learners. They used a large language model to measure semantic similarity between WordNet senses and CEFR-level vocabulary. By developing a corpus with sense and CEFR-level information, they created contextual lexical classifiers. The models trained on this corpus performed well, comparable to gold-standard annotations. Combining the corpus with gold-standard data, they achieved high accuracy in classification.

Abstract: Although WordNet is a valuable resource owing to its structured semantic networks and extensive vocabulary, its fine-grained sense distinctions can be challenging for second-language learners. To address this, we developed a WordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those trained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with the gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations. Our annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to help bridge the gap between natural language processing and language education, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient language learning.

The article introduces two Italian medical benchmarks, IMB-QA and IMB-MCQA, containing patient-doctor conversations and multiple-choice questions, respectively. It explores the challenges in automated question answering systems due to the informal nature of forum interactions and linguistic complexity. The study demonstrates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance clarity and consistency in medical forum data while maintaining the original conversational style. Different LLM architectures are compared for both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Results show that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering.

Abstract: Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge. However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems, especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644 patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA}, comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale. We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to support further research on multilingual medical question answering: https://github.com/PRAISELab-PicusLab/IMB.

Summary: The article introduces DART, a structured corpus of Italian Summaries of Product Characteristics for extracting pharmacological knowledge from regulatory texts. DART fills the gap in resources tailored to the Italian healthcare system and includes information on indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. The dataset was created using a reproducible pipeline and a few-shot-tuned large language model.

Abstract: The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support. However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub: https://github.com/PRAISELab-PicusLab/DART.

Summary:
Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are a promising alternative to Autoregressive (AR) models, offering parallel decoding for increased efficiency. However, current open-source DLMs often lag behind AR models in speed, limiting their practical applications. A systematic study of DLM efficiency highlighted issues in prior evaluation methods. Empirical benchmarking and theoretical analysis showed that AR models generally achieve higher throughput compared to DLMs. Acceleration strategies, such as dual cache and parallel decoding, were found to be more beneficial at smaller batch sizes, with diminishing returns as scale increases. The study emphasized the importance of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

<div> cultural reasoning, language models, diversity, global users, identity-aware AI <br />
Summary: 
Large language models are prevalent in natural language processing but often lack cultural reasoning, which is the ability to recognize and adjust output based on cultural values and norms. This capability is crucial for identity-aware AI and can help models avoid perpetuating stereotypes and biases. Current models tend to default to Western norms, even after fine-tuning on diverse datasets. Traditional evaluation methods focus on static accuracy scores and may not capture adaptive reasoning in context. To address this, cultural reasoning should be considered a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and linguistic coherence. By defining the concept and proposing assessment directions, future systems can better respond to the diverse cultural landscape of human interactions. <br /> <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language processing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However, their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour, cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human culture.

Abstract: Large language models offer transformative potential for healthcare, yet their responsible and equitable development depends critically on a deeper understanding of how training data characteristics influence model behavior, including the potential for bias. Current practices in dataset curation and bias assessment often lack the necessary transparency, creating an urgent need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to foster trust and guide improvements. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of potential downstream biases in clinical language models, with a focus on differential opioid prescription tendencies across diverse demographic groups, such as ethnicity, gender, and age. As part of this investigation, we introduce HC4: Healthcare Comprehensive Commons Corpus, a novel and extensively curated pretraining dataset exceeding 89 billion tokens. Our evaluation leverages both established general benchmarks and a novel, healthcare-specific methodology, offering crucial insights to support fairness and safety in clinical AI applications.

Summary:
The article discusses the issue of digital dehumanization in online interactions, emphasizing the need to address subtler forms of dehumanization that perpetuate harmful biases against marginalized groups. The existing research focuses mainly on overtly negative statements as markers of dehumanization, but fails to consider the broader spectrum of dehumanization. To fill this gap, the authors collect a bilingual dataset from Twitter and Reddit, covering different dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset is annotated by crowdworkers and experts at a document- and span-level. Machine learning models are then fine-tuned on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings. The dataset serves as a valuable training resource and benchmark for future dehumanization detection techniques.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing. The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization. Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness, making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

Abstract: The control of speech can be modelled as a dynamical system in which articulators are driven toward target positions. These models are typically evaluated using fleshpoint data, such as electromagnetic articulography (EMA), but recent methodological advances make ultrasound imaging a promising alternative. We evaluate whether the parameters of a linear harmonic oscillator can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics and compare these with parameters estimated from simultaneously-recorded EMA data. We find that ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, while mandibular short tendon tracking also adequately captures jaw motion. This supports using ultrasound kinematics to evaluate dynamical articulatory models.

Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging task, especially when balancing performance across high- and low-resource languages. Recent advances in sequence modeling suggest that architectures beyond Transformers may offer better scalability and efficiency. In this work, we introduce MLMA (Multilingual Language Modeling with Mamba for ASR), a new approach that leverages the Mamba architecture--an efficient state-space model optimized for long-context sequence processing--for multilingual ASR. Using Mamba, MLMA implicitly incorporates language-aware conditioning and shared representations to support robust recognition across diverse languages. Experiments on standard multilingual benchmarks show that MLMA achieves competitive performance compared to Transformer-based architectures. These results highlight Mamba's potential as a strong backbone for scalable, efficient, and accurate multilingual speech recognition.

Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation, we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.

<title>SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA: Efficient Domain Adaptation for Transformer-based Low-Resource Language Translation with a Case Study on Irish</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks such as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning is computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with billions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers working on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original model parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing small, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain adaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that SemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA can propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We further evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our embedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier corpora. All Irish translation models developed in this work are released as open resources. These methods aim to make high-quality domain adaptation and fine-tuning more accessible to researchers working with low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings. Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty (in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system, RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention, reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to 75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together, these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and trustworthy LLMs.

Abstract: Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs. We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the organization of linguistic information in the human brain.

Abstract: AI is rapidly transforming journalism, but the extent of its use in published newspaper articles remains unclear. We address this gap by auditing a large-scale dataset of 186K articles from online editions of 1.5K American newspapers published in the summer of 2025. Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art AI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are either partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed, appearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as weather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze 45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated content than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged op-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find that AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles found only five disclosures of AI use. Overall, our audit highlights the immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards regarding the use of AI in journalism to maintain public trust.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in agentic coding, where models autonomously reason, plan, and act within interactive software development workflows. However, bridging the gap between static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a core challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing Mid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage constructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten development contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy optimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model to production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured Trajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning, forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents. Our KAT series 32B model, KAT-Dev, has been open-sourced on https://huggingface.co/Kwaipilot/KAT-Dev.

Abstract: Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent information retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments. Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative interactions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection mechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more reflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use chains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and 90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM counterparts.

Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput while preserving model accuracy.

<title>Towards Faithful and Controllable Personalization via Critique-Post-Edit Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

Abstract: We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches; (2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and (3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline for open-source model performance.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

<title>How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?</title>

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens. Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii) Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end. Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in transformer-based models.

<title>Does GenAI Rewrite How We Write? An Empirical Study on Two-Million Preprints</title>

Abstract: Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly communication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and evaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs) introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs reshape scientific publishing remains limited.
  This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1 million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled research ecosystem.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented demands for computational power, yet methods for evaluating the performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of deployed models remain fragmented. Current approaches often fail to provide a holistic view, making it difficult to compare and optimise systems across heterogeneous hardware, software stacks, and numeric precisions. To address this gap, we propose a unified and reproducible methodology for AI model inference that integrates computational and environmental metrics under realistic serving conditions. Our framework provides a pragmatic, carbon-aware evaluation by systematically measuring latency and throughput distributions, energy consumption, and location-adjusted carbon emissions, all while maintaining matched accuracy constraints for valid comparisons. We apply this methodology to multi-precision models across diverse hardware platforms, from data-centre accelerators like the GH200 to consumer-level GPUs such as the RTX 4090, running on mainstream software stacks including PyTorch, TensorRT, and ONNX Runtime. By systematically categorising these factors, our work establishes a rigorous benchmarking framework that produces decision-ready Pareto frontiers, clarifying the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, energy, and carbon. The accompanying open-source code enables independent verification and facilitates adoption, empowering researchers and practitioners to make evidence-based decisions for sustainable AI deployment.

<title>Hierarchical Federated Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution, yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared with baseline methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are entering legal workflows, yet we lack a jurisdiction-specific framework to assess their baseline competence therein. We use India's public legal examinations as a transparent proxy. Our multi-year benchmark assembles objective screens from top national and state exams and evaluates open and frontier LLMs under real-world exam conditions. To probe beyond multiple-choice questions, we also include a lawyer-graded, paired-blinded study of long-form answers from the Supreme Court's Advocate-on-Record exam. This is, to our knowledge, the first exam-grounded, India-specific yardstick for LLM court-readiness released with datasets and protocols. Our work shows that while frontier systems consistently clear historical cutoffs and often match or exceed recent top-scorer bands on objective exams, none surpasses the human topper on long-form reasoning. Grader notes converge on three reliability failure modes: procedural or format compliance, authority or citation discipline, and forum-appropriate voice and structure. These findings delineate where LLMs can assist (checks, cross-statute consistency, statute and precedent lookups) and where human leadership remains essential: forum-specific drafting and filing, procedural and relief strategy, reconciling authorities and exceptions, and ethical, accountable judgment.

Abstract: The proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing structured data and adhering to syntactic rules is a capability that drives their widespread adoption but also makes them paradoxically vulnerable. In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability through BreakFun, a jailbreak methodology that weaponizes an LLM's adherence to structured schemas. BreakFun employs a three-part prompt that combines an innocent framing and a Chain-of-Thought distraction with a core "Trojan Schema"--a carefully crafted data structure that compels the model to generate harmful content, exploiting the LLM's strong tendency to follow structures and schemas. We demonstrate this vulnerability is highly transferable, achieving an average success rate of 89% across 13 foundational and proprietary models on JailbreakBench, and reaching a 100% Attack Success Rate (ASR) on several prominent models. A rigorous ablation study confirms this Trojan Schema is the attack's primary causal factor. To counter this, we introduce the Adversarial Prompt Deconstruction guardrail, a defense that utilizes a secondary LLM to perform a "Literal Transcription"--extracting all human-readable text to isolate and reveal the user's true harmful intent. Our proof-of-concept guardrail demonstrates high efficacy against the attack, validating that targeting the deceptive schema is a viable mitigation strategy. Our work provides a look into how an LLM's core strengths can be turned into critical weaknesses, offering a fresh perspective for building more robustly aligned models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in education, yet their correctness alone does not capture the quality, reliability, or pedagogical validity of their problem-solving behavior, especially in mathematics, where multistep logic, symbolic reasoning, and conceptual clarity are critical. Conventional evaluation methods largely focus on final answer accuracy and overlook the reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a novel interpretability framework for analyzing LLM-generated solutions using undergraduate calculus problems as a representative domain. Our approach combines reasoning flow extraction and decomposing solutions into semantically labeled operations and concepts with prompt ablation analysis to assess input salience and output stability. Using structured metrics such as reasoning complexity, phrase sensitivity, and robustness, we evaluated the model behavior on real Calculus I to III university exams. Our findings revealed that LLMs often produce syntactically fluent yet conceptually flawed solutions, with reasoning patterns sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variation. This framework enables fine-grained diagnosis of reasoning failures, supports curriculum alignment, and informs the design of interpretable AI-assisted feedback tools. This is the first study to offer a structured, quantitative, and pedagogically grounded framework for interpreting LLM reasoning in mathematics education, laying the foundation for the transparent and responsible deployment of AI in STEM learning environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are improving at an exceptional rate. With the advent of agentic workflows, multi-turn dialogue has become the de facto mode of interaction with LLMs for completing long and complex tasks. While LLM capabilities continue to improve, they remain increasingly susceptible to jailbreaking, especially in multi-turn scenarios where harmful intent can be subtly injected across the conversation to produce nefarious outcomes. While single-turn attacks have been extensively explored, adaptability, efficiency and effectiveness continue to remain key challenges for their multi-turn counterparts. To address these gaps, we present PLAGUE, a novel plug-and-play framework for designing multi-turn attacks inspired by lifelong-learning agents. PLAGUE dissects the lifetime of a multi-turn attack into three carefully designed phases (Primer, Planner and Finisher) that enable a systematic and information-rich exploration of the multi-turn attack family. Evaluations show that red-teaming agents designed using PLAGUE achieve state-of-the-art jailbreaking results, improving attack success rates (ASR) by more than 30% across leading models in a lesser or comparable query budget. Particularly, PLAGUE enables an ASR (based on StrongReject) of 81.4% on OpenAI's o3 and 67.3% on Claude's Opus 4.1, two models that are considered highly resistant to jailbreaks in safety literature. Our work offers tools and insights to understand the importance of plan initialization, context optimization and lifelong learning in crafting multi-turn attacks for a comprehensive model vulnerability evaluation.

<title>Subject-Event Ontology Without Global Time: Foundations and Execution Semantics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models (conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before - the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3) making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms (A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3) without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures, DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from different subjects).

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset, which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements, state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally, highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods, which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency. Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline, which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32 critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation systems.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However, the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation. Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4% inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code generation.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns. Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories. Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to 53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language safety.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3) mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

<title>Position: LLM Watermarking Should Align Stakeholders' Incentives for Practical Adoption</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18333</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Despite progress in watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs), real-world deployment remains limited. We argue that this gap stems from misaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, which manifest as four key barriers: competitive risk, detection-tool governance, robustness concerns and attribution issues. We revisit three classes of watermarking through this lens. \emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with LLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems. \emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely as an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such as dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \emph{In-context watermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference organizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into documents. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the output carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns incentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection tool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark instructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned methods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable tools to detect misuse. More broadly, we distill design principles for incentive-aligned, domain-specific watermarking and outline future research directions. Our position is that the practical adoption of LLM watermarking requires aligning stakeholder incentives in targeted application domains and fostering active community engagement.

<title>CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment</title>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model (LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty. Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions. These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city applications.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects, including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully on-policy data.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes, requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought a pressing challenge: how to reliably assess hallucinations to guarantee model trustworthiness. Although Automatic Hallucination Evaluation (AHE) has become an indispensable component of this effort, the field remains fragmented in its methodologies, limiting both conceptual clarity and practical progress. This survey addresses this critical gap through a systematic analysis of 105 evaluation methods, revealing that 77.1% specifically target LLMs, a paradigm shift that demands new evaluation frameworks. We formulate a structured framework to organize the field, based on a survey of foundational datasets and benchmarks and a taxonomy of evaluation methodologies, which together systematically document the evolution from pre-LLM to post-LLM approaches. Beyond taxonomical organization, we identify fundamental limitations in current approaches and their implications for real-world deployment. To guide future research, we delineate key challenges and propose strategic directions, including enhanced interpretability mechanisms and integration of application-specific evaluation criteria, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing more robust and practical hallucination evaluation systems.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a promising approach for detecting hallucinations and low-quality output of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining proper uncertainty scores is complicated by the conditional dependency between the generation steps of an autoregressive LLM because it is hard to model it explicitly. Here, we propose to learn this dependency from attention-based features. In particular, we train a regression model that leverages LLM attention maps, probabilities on the current generation step, and recurrently computed uncertainty scores from previously generated tokens. To incorporate the recurrent features, we also suggest a two-staged training procedure. Our experimental evaluation on ten datasets and three LLMs shows that the proposed method is highly effective for selective generation, achieving substantial improvements over rivaling unsupervised and supervised approaches.

Abstract: Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text embeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in black-box LLMs is vital for reliable responses and scalable oversight. Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the target query, can be misleading: an LLM may confidently provide an incorrect answer to a target query, yet give a confident and accurate answer to that same target query when answering a knowledge-preserving perturbation of the query. We systematically analyze the model behaviors and demonstrate that this discrepancy stems from suboptimal retrieval of parametric knowledge, often due to contextual biases that prevent consistent access to stored knowledge. We then introduce DiverseAgentEntropy, a novel, theoretically-grounded method employing multi-agent interaction across diverse query variations for uncertainty estimation of black-box LLMs. This approach more accurately assesses an LLM's true uncertainty and improves hallucination detection, outperforming existing self-consistency based techniques.

Abstract: WHAT-IF -- Writing a Hero's Alternate Timeline through Interactive Fiction -- is a system that uses zero-shot meta-prompting to create branching narratives from a prewritten story. Played as an interactive fiction (IF) game, WHAT-IF lets the player choose between decisions that the large language model (LLM) GPT-4 generates as possible branches in the story. Starting with an existing linear plot as input, a branch is created at each key decision taken by the main character. By meta-prompting the LLM to consider the major plot points from the story, the system produces coherent and well-structured alternate storylines. WHAT-IF stores the branching plot tree in a graph which helps it to both keep track of the story for prompting and maintain the structure for the final IF system. A demo of WHAT-IF can be found at https://what-if-game.github.io/.

Abstract: Most of the world's languages and dialects are low-resource, and lack support in mainstream machine translation (MT) models. However, many of them have a closely-related high-resource language (HRL) neighbor, and differ in linguistically regular ways from it. This underscores the importance of model robustness to dialectal variation and cross-lingual generalization to the HRL dialect continuum. We present DialUp, consisting of a training-time technique for adapting a pretrained model to dialectal data (M->D), and an inference-time intervention adapting dialectal data to the model expertise (D->M). M->D induces model robustness to potentially unseen and unknown dialects by exposure to synthetic data exemplifying linguistic mechanisms of dialectal variation, whereas D->M treats dialectal divergence for known target dialects. These methods show considerable performance gains for several dialects from four language families, and modest gains for two other language families. We also conduct feature and error analyses, which show that language varieties with low baseline MT performance are more likely to benefit from these approaches.

Abstract: The rapid development of multilingual large language models (LLMs) highlights the need for high-quality, diverse, and well-curated multilingual datasets. In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus constructed from newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual sources. DCAD-2000 covers 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of text, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of existing data cleaning approaches, which rely on manually designed heuristic thresholds, we reframe data cleaning as an anomaly detection problem. This dynamic filtering paradigm substantially improves data quality by automatically identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. By fine-tuning LLMs on DCAD-2000, we demonstrate notable improvements in data quality, robustness of the cleaning pipeline, and downstream performance, particularly for low-resource languages across multiple multilingual benchmarks.

<title>Temporal Alignment of LLMs through Cycle Encoding for Long-Range Time Representations</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) suffer from temporal misalignment issues especially across long span of time. The issue arises from knowing that LLMs are trained on large amounts of data where temporal information is rather sparse over long times, such as thousands of years, resulting in insufficient learning or catastrophic forgetting by the LLMs. This paper proposes a methodology named "Ticktack" for addressing the LLM's long-time span misalignment in a yearly setting. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the sexagenary year expression instead of the Gregorian year expression employed by LLMs, achieving a more uniform distribution in yearly granularity. Then, we employ polar coordinates to model the sexagenary cycle of 60 terms and the year order within each term, with additional temporal encoding to ensure LLMs understand them. Finally, we present a temporal representational alignment approach for post-training LLMs that effectively distinguishes time points with relevant knowledge, hence improving performance on time-related tasks, particularly over a long period. We also create a long time span benchmark for evaluation. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposal.

Abstract: Test-time domain adaptation (TTDA) is an excellent method which helps generalize models across domains, tasks, and distributions without the use of labeled datasets. Thus, TTDA is very useful in natural language processing (NLP) in the dialectal setting, since oftentimes, models are trained on Standard American English (SAE), evaluated on Indian English (IndE), Singaporean English (SingE), or Nigerian English (NgE), of which distribution differs significantly from the former. This is especially useful since dialectal datasets are scarce. In this paper, we explore one of the most famous TTDA techniques, SHOT, in dialectal NLP. We finetune and evaluate SHOT on different combinations of dialectal GLUE. Our findings show that SHOT is a viable technique when labeled datasets are unavailable. We also theoretically propose the concept of dialectal gap and show that it has a positive correlation with the effectiveness of SHOT. We also find that in many cases, finetuning on SAE yields higher performance than finetuning on dialectal data.

<title>VITA-Audio: Fast Interleaved Cross-Modal Token Generation for Efficient Large Speech-Language Model</title>

Abstract: With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.

Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages, provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained on unaligned multilingual data.

Abstract: Automated fact-checking has been a challenging task for the research community. Past works tried various strategies, such as end-to-end training, retrieval-augmented generation, and prompt engineering, to build robust fact-checking systems. However, their accuracy has not been very high for real-world deployment. We, on the other hand, propose a simple yet effective strategy, where entailed justifications generated by LLMs are used to train encoder-only language models (ELMs) for fact-checking. We conducted a rigorous set of experiments, comparing our approach with recent works and various prompting and fine-tuning strategies to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Additionally, we did quality analysis of model explanations, ablation studies, and error analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of our approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Abstract: We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR (Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity. Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to -41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond). Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes, data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning. Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact, cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/puppeteer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, and Claude achieve remarkable performance in text generation but remain opaque in their decision-making processes, limiting trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We present gSMILE (generative SMILE), a model-agnostic, perturbation-based framework for token-level interpretability in LLMs. Extending the SMILE methodology, gSMILE uses controlled prompt perturbations, Wasserstein distance metrics, and weighted linear surrogates to identify input tokens with the most significant impact on the output. This process enables the generation of intuitive heatmaps that visually highlight influential tokens and reasoning paths. We evaluate gSMILE across leading LLMs (OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, Meta's LLaMA 3.1 Instruct Turbo, and Anthropic's Claude 2.1) using attribution fidelity, attribution consistency, attribution stability, attribution faithfulness, and attribution accuracy as metrics. Results show that gSMILE delivers reliable human-aligned attributions, with Claude 2.1 excelling in attention fidelity and GPT-3.5 achieving the highest output consistency. These findings demonstrate gSMILE's ability to balance model performance and interpretability, enabling more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Building Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems that generalize across different tasks remains a challenging problem. Data-driven approaches often struggle to transfer effectively to unseen tasks. While recent schema-based TOD frameworks improve generalization by decoupling task logic from language understanding, their reliance on neural or generative models often obscures how task schemas influence behaviour and hence impair interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), which converts a TOD task schema, represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, to programmatic LLM guardrailing code, such as NVIDIA's Colang, enabling interpretable and efficient alignment of dialogue policies during inference. We introduce two paradigms, $\text{CoDial}_{\text{free}}$ and $\text{CoDial}_{\text{structured}}$ for generating LLM guardrails, and propose a feedback mechanism that integrates human feedback to iteratively improve the generated code. Empirically, CoDial achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the widely used STAR dataset and is on par with SOTA on the MultiWOZ dataset, while also providing interpretability. We additionally demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models exhibit remarkable performance in in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason about the input context on the fly. This work studies in-context counterfactual reasoning in language models, that is, the ability to predict consequences of a hypothetical scenario. We focus on a well-defined, synthetic linear regression task that requires noise abduction. Accurate prediction is based on (1) inferring an unobserved latent concept and (2) copying contextual noise from factual observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual reasoning. Further, we enhance existing identifiability results and reduce counterfactual reasoning for a broad class of functions to a transformation on in-context observations. In Transformers, we find that self-attention, model depth and pre-training data diversity drive performance. Moreover, we provide mechanistic evidence that the latent concept is linearly represented in the residual stream and we introduce designated \textit{noise abduction heads} central to performing counterfactual reasoning. Lastly, our findings extend to counterfactual reasoning under SDE dynamics and reflect that Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our code is available under https://github.com/mrtzmllr/iccr.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO). We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not know whether certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains. Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains, and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are not only largely ineffective but also frequently have a negative impact on document ranking, which is opposite to what is expected. Instead, traditional SEO strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/parameterlab/c-seo-bench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/parameterlab/c-seo-bench.

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on concept-relation prediction tasks, we show that ablating these components for concepts (e.g., countries and words) and relations (e.g., capital city and translation language) changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and concept components yields compound counterfactual outputs. Further analysis reveals that while most concept components emerge from the very first layer, more abstract relation components are concentrated in later layers. Lastly, we show that extracted components more comprehensively capture concepts and relations than individual features while maintaining specificity. Overall, our findings suggest a modular organization of knowledge accessed through compositional operations, and advance methods for efficient, targeted LLM manipulation.

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor quality for mid- to low-resource languages, but the causes for this are not well-understood. We first demonstrate the existence of an implicit task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage, despite task-solving success, is an important culprit for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the translation barrier hypothesis. We quantify the extent to which either stage in the pipeline is responsible for final failure for a word translation task across 108 language pairs, and find that the translation barrier explains a dominant portion of error for a majority of language pairs, and is especially severe for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an important bottleneck for end-to-end multilingual generation, relevant for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge: predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources, thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE models.

Abstract: The predictive uncertainty of machine translation (MT) models is typically used as a quality estimation proxy. In this work, we posit that apart from confidently translating when a single correct translation exists, models should also maintain uncertainty when the input is ambiguous. We use uncertainty to measure gender bias in MT systems. When the source sentence includes a lexeme whose gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the context and can be susceptible to biases. Prior work measured bias via gender accuracy, however it cannot be applied to ambiguous cases. Using semantic uncertainty, we are able to assess bias when translating both ambiguous and unambiguous source sentences, and find that high translation accuracy does not correlate with exhibiting uncertainty appropriately, and that debiasing affects the two cases differently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge. We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs) that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusion. Through our experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled benchmarks when the latter is unavailable. We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they do not consistently produce reliable RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/THUDM/LLM4CardGame

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling, REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy Evolution) are presented.

Abstract: This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database (SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future synthetic diary evaluation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach: fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the original document.

<title>Correct-Detect: Balancing Performance and Ambiguity Through the Lens of Coreference Resolution in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are intended to reflect human linguistic competencies. But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention? This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off: though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

<title>Semantic Agreement Enables Efficient Open-Ended LLM Cascades</title>

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence. Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs, and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for real-world LLM deployment.

<title>Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization (i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive settings.

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could afford some real gains in such tasks.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability, conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models (ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in mathematical theorem proving, particularly when utilizing formal languages such as LEAN. A prevalent proof method involves the LLM prover iteratively constructing the proof tactic by tactic, typically following a best-first search scheme. However, this method often ignores the critical preference information inside the existing tactic trajectories, hindering the search for deeper proofs. We propose an intuitive yet effective method, which utilizes a critic model to capture the preference information and to guide the search of the prover model at runtime. Given the prover-critic framework, a large-scale expert iteration with more than 20,000 CPU days is then applied to further fine-tune the prover and the critic. The trained InternLM2.5-StepProver critic significantly boosts the performance of the prover model (59.4% to 65.9%). We also analyze the impact of the critic on various aspects of the theorem proving process during expert iteration, providing insights into its effectiveness. We open-source our models and searched proofs at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/Lean-Workbook.

Abstract: Training data is the backbone of large language models (LLMs), yet today's data markets often operate under exploitative pricing -- sourcing data from marginalized groups with little pay or recognition. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for LLM data markets, modeling the strategic interactions between buyers (LLM builders) and sellers (human annotators). We begin with theoretical and empirical analysis showing how exploitative pricing drives high-quality sellers out of the market, degrading data quality and long-term model performance. Then we introduce fairshare, a pricing mechanism grounded in data valuation that quantifies each data's contribution. It aligns incentives by sustaining seller participation and optimizing utility for both buyers and sellers. Theoretically, we show that fairshare yields mutually optimal outcomes: maximizing long-term buyer utility and seller profit while sustaining market participation. Empirically when training open-source LLMs on complex NLP tasks, including math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning, fairshare boosts seller earnings and ensures a stable supply of high-quality data, while improving buyers' performance-per-dollar and long-term welfare. Our findings offer a concrete path toward fair, transparent, and economically sustainable data markets for LLM.

Abstract: Measuring similarity between training examples is critical for curating high-quality and diverse pretraining datasets for language models. However, similarity is typically computed with a generic off-the-shelf embedding model that has been trained for tasks such as retrieval. Whether these embedding-based similarity metrics are well-suited for pretraining data selection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new framework to assess the suitability of a similarity metric specifically for data curation in language model pretraining applications. Our framework's first evaluation criterion captures how well distances reflect generalization in pretraining loss between different training examples. Next, we use each embedding model to guide a standard diversity-based data curation algorithm and measure its utility by pretraining a language model on the selected data and evaluating downstream task performance. Finally, we evaluate the capabilities of embeddings to distinguish between examples from different data sources. With these evaluations, we demonstrate that standard off-the-shelf embedding models are not well-suited for the pretraining data curation setting, underperforming even remarkably simple embeddings that are extracted from models trained on the same pretraining corpus. Our experiments are performed on the Pile, for pretraining a 1.7B parameter language model on 200B tokens. We believe our analysis and evaluation framework serves as a foundation for the future design of embeddings that specifically reason about similarity in pretraining datasets.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which are not designed for dynamic systems, especially for dynamic memory states of LLM agents. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial recommenders.
  To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent.

Abstract: Training effective dense retrieval models typically relies on hard negative (HN) examples mined from large document corpora using methods such as BM25 or cross-encoders (CE), which require full corpus access. We propose a corpus-free alternative: an end-to-end pipeline where a Large Language Model (LLM) first generates a query from a passage and then produces a hard negative example using only the generated query text. Our dataset comprises 7,250 arXiv abstracts spanning diverse domains including mathematics, physics, computer science, and related fields, serving as positive passages for query generation. We evaluate two fine-tuning configurations of DistilBERT for dense retrieval; one using LLM-generated hard negatives conditioned solely on the query, and another using negatives generated with both the query and its positive document as context. Compared to traditional corpus-based mining methods {LLM Query $\rightarrow$ BM25 HN and LLM Query $\rightarrow$ CE HN on multiple BEIR benchmark datasets, our all-LLM pipeline outperforms strong lexical mining baselines and achieves performance comparable to cross-encoder-based methods, demonstrating the potential of corpus-free hard negative generation for retrieval model training.

<title>Segment Policy Optimization: Effective Segment-Level Credit Assignment in RL for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities: token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide fine-grained advantage signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g., GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward, leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods, enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT, featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates scalable, automated fact-checking solutions. Yet, current benchmarks often overlook multilingual and topical diversity. This paper introduces a novel, dynamically extensible data set that includes 61,514 claims in multiple languages and topics, extending existing datasets up to 2024. Through a comprehensive evaluation of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA 3.1, and Mixtral 8x7B, we identify significant performance gaps between different languages and topics. While overall GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, it declines to classify 43% of claims. Across all models, factual-sounding claims are misclassified more often than opinions, revealing a key vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for caution and highlight challenges in deploying LLM-based fact-checking systems at scale.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification. Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints such as latency and data limitations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our dataset is made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Leigest/MSR-Align.

arXiv:2509.17393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.

arXiv:2509.24248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

arXiv:2510.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

Summary: This study investigates the concept of Self-Refinement in large language models (LLMs) and proposes the EVOLVE framework to improve this capability through iterative training. The research finds that LLMs typically do not exhibit inherent Self-Refinement and may suffer from decreased response quality after attempted refinement. EVOLVE addresses this issue by optimizing training methods to activate Self-Refinement and exploring generation strategies during inference to enhance and utilize this ability effectively. By synergistically optimizing both training and inference stages, the model's Self-Refinement evolves, leading to improved response quality and overall model performance. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve significant boosts in performance, surpassing state-of-the-art models in various tasks such as length-based and raw win rates, as well as demonstrating generalization to out-of-domain reasoning tasks like mathematical reasoning benchmarks GSM8K and MATH.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.

Abstract: This paper makes three contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of 1,419,047 comments posted on 3,161 YouTube news videos of major US cable news outlets, we analyze how users engage with LGBTQ+ news content. Our analyses focus both on positive and negative content. In particular, we construct a fine-grained hope speech classifier that detects positive (hope speech), negative, neutral, and irrelevant content. Second, in consultation with a public health expert specializing on LGBTQ+ health, we conduct an annotation study with a balanced and diverse political representation and release a dataset of 3,750 instances with fine-grained labels and detailed annotator demographic information. Finally, beyond providing a vital resource for the LGBTQ+ community, our annotation study and subsequent in-the-wild assessments reveal (1) strong association between rater political beliefs and how they rate content relevant to a marginalized community; (2) models trained on individual political beliefs exhibit considerable in-the-wild disagreement; and (3) zero-shot large language models (LLMs) align more with liberal raters.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of machine learning models to predict patient outcomes using clinical case reports. By extracting timestamped clinical findings and utilizing large language models, such as transformers, the researchers evaluated different models for event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. They found that encoder-based models performed better in event forecasting, while decoder models showed advantages in survival analysis. Time ordering was deemed crucial for accurate predictions, emphasizing the importance of constructing time-ordered corpora for temporal tasks in the context of large language model usage. The study highlights the potential for utilizing temporal patient trajectories encoded in clinical text for improved predictive accuracy. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Clinical case reports encode temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for enhancing model reasoning. However, existing RL methods like GRPO often rely on unstructured self-sampling to fit scalar rewards, often producing inefficient rollouts that fail to capture transferable problem-solving strategies. To address these limitations, we propose **TemplateRL**, a structured template-guided RL framework that augments policy optimization with explicit template guidance. Our approach first constructs a problem-solving template library via MCTS on a small seed set, then seamlessly integrates this high-level structured guidance into RL training. By guiding rollout generation to align with proven template structures, TemplateRL significantly improves high-quality trajectory hit rates while reducing ineffective exploration. This structure-guided design steers the policy toward validated strategic patterns, stabilizing training dynamics, and enhancing RL sampling efficiency. Notably, the explicit template library is interpretable, editable, and supports online updates-enabling continuous updates during both training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemplateRL outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME and 41% on AMC, with superior stability on weak models and remarkable cross-domain generalization, highlighting its potential for broader tasks.

Summary:
The study examines the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering factual questions and highlights a significant inconsistency in how these models access factual knowledge across different task complexities. The researchers introduce the Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ) framework to compare LLMs' responses to factual questions presented in both simple and complex formats. They discover a systematic misalignment in the answers provided by LLMs for short and long queries, along with position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects. The study also reveals that aligned facts activate similar internal mechanisms within the models and proposes that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict answer alignment accuracy. Overall, the research underscores the importance of factual consistency in LLMs across varying query complexities and raises questions about the trustworthiness of current evaluation practices that may not adequately assess the reliability of these models for complex knowledge-seeking tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Summary:
Using large language models (LLMs) for survey synthesis can introduce significant bias in population estimates. By combining synthesis with rectification methods, bias can be reduced to below 5% and the effective sample size increased by up to 14%. Allocation of human responses between synthesis and rectification is crucial, with findings challenging the common practice of allocating all human responses to fine-tuning. A fixed budget allocation, with more responses allocated to rectification, results in more effective estimation. Two panel surveys on nutrition, politics, and economics were used to study the interplay between synthesis and rectification methods, highlighting the potential for LLMs to provide scalable, low-cost alternatives to traditional surveys when properly utilized.<br /><br />Summary: Using large language models for survey synthesis can introduce bias, but combining synthesis with rectification methods can reduce bias and increase sample size.

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%.

<div> framework, LLMs, mathematical statements, theorem proving, retrieval <br />
Summary: <br /> 
The article introduces DRIFT, a framework designed to assist Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving. LLMs often struggle to identify and utilize prerequisite mathematical knowledge and formal representations in languages like Lean. DRIFT addresses this challenge by breaking down complex informal mathematical statements into smaller, more manageable sub-components. This enables targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib and provides illustrative theorems to aid LLMs in formalization tasks. Evaluation across different benchmarks demonstrates that DRIFT significantly improves premise retrieval, showing a nearly doubled F1 score compared to existing methods. Particularly, DRIFT exhibits strong performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper explores the use of Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) models for Natural Language Inference tasks. By leveraging quantum circuits, the study compares quantum, hybrid, and classical transformer-based models under a few-shot constraint. The research utilizes the lambeq library and DisCoCat framework to create parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs, training them for semantic relatedness and inference classification. A novel metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), is introduced to assess learning efficiency independently of model size. Results indicate that quantum models achieve comparable performance to classical baselines with significantly fewer parameters. Quantum models outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference tasks and show lower test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit remarkably higher learning efficiency per parameter, suggesting the potential of QNLP in scenarios with limited resources and structure sensitivity. A novel cluster-based architecture is proposed to enhance generalization by linking gate parameters to learned word clusters instead of individual tokens. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource, structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234 radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of 62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a 95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions, agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

<div> Keywords: Self-correction methods, language models, reasoning performance, CorrectBench, efficiency 

Summary: 
Self-correction methods for large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing their reasoning performance. In this study, the CorrectBench benchmark evaluates the effectiveness of various self-correction strategies across tasks such as commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. The findings suggest that self-correction methods can improve accuracy, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Combining different self-correction strategies can lead to further enhancements but may decrease efficiency. LLMs designed for reasoning have limited optimization with additional self-correction methods and can be time-intensive. Surprisingly, a basic chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results emphasize the potential of self-correction in improving LLM reasoning while highlighting the ongoing challenge of balancing reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Further research is needed to optimize this balance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page: https://correctbench.github.io/

Summary: 
The EvolveR framework addresses the limitation of Large Language Model (LLM) agents by enabling self-improvement through a closed-loop experience lifecycle. The framework consists of two key stages: Offline Self-Distillation, where interaction trajectories are synthesized into reusable strategic principles, and Online Interaction, where the agent uses distilled principles to guide decision-making and updates its performance through policy reinforcement. By incorporating self-learning capabilities, EvolveR outperforms strong agentic baselines in complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks. This approach not only allows agents to learn from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, leading to more autonomous and continuously improving systems. The code for EvolveR is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making, accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously improving systems.

<div> Keywords: large language models, systematic literature reviews, prompt strategies, model-prompt interaction, automated screening

Summary: This study evaluates the interaction between prompt strategies and large language models (LLMs) in automating the screening stage of systematic literature reviews. Six LLMs and five prompt types are tested across relevance classification and Level-2 tasks, showing varied performance outcomes. Chain-of-thought-few-shot prompt yields the most reliable precision-recall balance, while zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes. Self-reflection prompts demonstrate over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek exhibit robust performance, with GPT-4o-mini offering competitive results at a lower cost. Cost-performance analysis reveals significant differences among model-prompt pairings, recommending the use of low-cost models with structured prompts for initial screening and escalation of borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to automate literature screening but highlight the need for task-specific prompt selection. <br /><br />Summary: This study explores how prompt strategies impact the performance of large language models in automating systematic literature reviews. Results show varied model-prompt interaction effects, with some combinations offering reliable precision-recall balance while others underperform. Recommendations include deploying low-cost models with structured prompts for initial screening and using higher-capacity models for borderline cases. These findings provide valuable insights for task-adaptive deployment of LLMs in literature screening processes. <div>

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection) across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance; zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that (1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

<div> Keywords: language models, generalization, factual recall, contextual structure, diversity level

Summary:
This article presents a synthetic testbed for analyzing the impact of contextual diversity and factual associations on language model generalization. The study finds that higher contextual diversity can delay in-distribution factual accuracy, but its effect on out-of-distribution generalization varies depending on contextual structure. Optimal diversity levels for factual recall depend on training duration, with some structures exhibiting failures in both factual recall and statistical generalization. The study identifies distinct optimization bottlenecks leading to out-of-distribution failures, highlighting the importance of embedding and unembedding layers in language models. The synthetic framework allows for controlled interventions to isolate specific effects, providing a valuable testbed for future investigations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD) factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration. Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade. This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed for future investigations.

- Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with shifts around major model releases.  
- Technical performance and usability are the main dimensions influencing trust or distrust.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025) spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a representative sample were combined with classification models to scale analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g., experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public perceptions of GenAI.

Summary: 
A new multimodal dataset, EgMM-Corpus, focusing on Egyptian culture has been introduced in this paper to address the lack of culturally diverse datasets, especially for regions in the Middle East and Africa. The dataset consists of over 3,000 images covering various concepts such as landmarks, food, and folklore, each validated for cultural authenticity and coherence. EgMM-Corpus is designed to serve as a reliable resource for evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context. The zero-shot performance of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model on this dataset showcases the existing cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models. The results emphasize the importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware models. <div>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore. Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context. We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and 36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware models.

Summary:  
Our theoretical analysis explores the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability in language models (LMs). We propose three predictions and validate them with empirical data from English and Chinese sentence pairs. Firstly, we observe a correlation in probabilities within minimal pairs of strings with minimal semantic differences. Secondly, we find a correlation between the adjustments made by models and humans within minimal pairs. Thirdly, we discover a lack of clear separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. These findings offer a theoretical basis for leveraging probability to understand LMs' grammatical knowledge and suggest avenues for further research in evaluating LMs' grammatical capabilities.   <div>
arXiv:2510.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM grammatical evaluation.

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on enhancing the alignment of language models with diverse perspectives and human values, particularly in low-resource settings. The researchers propose two methods, pluralistic decoding and model steering, to achieve pluralistic alignment in language models. Empirical results show that model steering outperforms zero-shot and few-shot baselines with just 50 annotated samples. The methods are effective in reducing false positives in critical tasks like hate speech and misinformation detection, as well as improving the alignment with human values in GlobalOpinionQA. The study emphasizes the significance of diversity and the need to adapt language models to consider nuanced perspectives.

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider nuanced perspectives.

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the ``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient, scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and "think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation. Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects, and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

<div> Keywords: Argument Mining, Argument Components, Argumentative Relations, Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction, NLP<br />
Summary:<br />
The study focuses on Argument Mining (AM) for extracting complex argumentative structures. It addresses the challenge of modelling dependencies between Argument Components (ACs) and Argumentative Relations (ARs) by proposing an Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. This framework jointly formulates key AM tasks in an end-to-end fashion using a conditional pre-trained language model. AASP models argumentative structures as predefined sets of actions, capturing the flow of argumentative reasoning in an autoregressive manner. Experimental results on three standard AM benchmarks show that AASP achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple AM tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing argumentative structures efficiently. <div>

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Summary:
This study introduces a cost-effective method to enhance the Mental Health assessment capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for computationally intensive techniques. By applying a linear transformation to a specific layer's activations using steering vectors, the model achieves improved performance in identifying depressive symptoms in Reddit posts and completing a psychological screening questionnaire for depression based on user data.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI, opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations, leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2) completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces MoReBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI procedural reasoning in moral dilemmas. It includes 1,000 moral scenarios with rubric criteria to assess reasoning processes. MoReBench-Theory further tests AI reasoning under different ethical frameworks. Results show that existing benchmarks for math and code fail to predict AI performance in moral reasoning. AI models display bias towards certain moral frameworks, potentially due to training paradigms. These benchmarks aim to enhance transparency and safety in AI decision-making processes.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces, present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations, weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously. Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA) as a solution to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. ATA employs a neuro-symbolic approach by dividing tasks into knowledge ingestion and task processing phases. In the knowledge ingestion phase, an LLM translates informal problem specifications into a formal knowledge base verified by human experts. In the task processing phase, incoming inputs are encoded into a formal language and utilized by a symbolic decision engine with the knowledge base to derive reliable results. The ATA implementation competes with state-of-the-art reasoning models in automated setups while ensuring trustworthiness. With a human-verified knowledge base, ATA outperforms larger models, exhibits determinism, stability against input perturbations, and immunity to prompt injection attacks. By leveraging symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a transparent, auditable, and reliable architecture for autonomous agents. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, FrugalPrompt, prompt compression, token attribution, NLP tasks.

Summary: 
FrugalPrompt is introduced as a prompt compression framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce redundancy in input sequences. The framework uses token attribution methods like GlobEnc and DecompX to assign salience scores to tokens and retain only the most significant ones. Evaluations on various NLP tasks show that a 20% prompt reduction results in minimal performance loss for tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense QA, and Summarization. However, mathematical reasoning tasks show a significant decline in performance, indicating a dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis reveals potential task contamination effects, where models rely on memorized patterns. This study contributes to understanding LLM behavior in balancing performance and efficiency, highlighting the importance of context in different tasks. The source code and models are available on GitHub for further exploration of the framework. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens. Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX, we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply, reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring exhaustive context.

Summary: 
TrajSelector is a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. It utilizes the hidden states of the sampler LLM to efficiently score reasoning trajectories, eliminating the need for costly process reward models. By employing a lightweight verifier and a fully data-driven training approach, TrajSelector achieves remarkable performance improvements without requiring massive step-level annotations. In Best-of-32 settings, it outperforms existing methods, including majority voting and process reward models, by significant margins while maintaining lower inference costs. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks showcase the consistency and effectiveness of TrajSelector in enhancing the scalability and efficiency of LLMs in reasoning tasks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS (particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by 4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall. RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

Summary:
This paper explores the variation in Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets due to human label differences. It introduces the LiTEx taxonomy to categorize reasoning types behind annotators' decisions in NLI annotation. The study broadens understanding by analyzing not only within-label variation but also divergence in labeling steps among annotators. By applying LiTEx to two NLI English datasets, the research aligns annotation variation in NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy agreement, considering annotators' selection bias. Findings reveal instances where annotators disagree on labels but provide similar explanations, suggesting underlying agreement in interpretation. The analysis uncovers individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices, emphasizing that agreement in reasoning types better reflects semantic similarity in free-text explanations than label agreement alone. The study underscores the importance of reasoning-based explanations and the caution needed when treating labels as definitive truth. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias. We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in complex environments need to prioritize safety.
- Uncertainties and ambiguities can lead to severe consequences in multi-turn agentic scenarios.
- The concept of "quitting" can be a simple yet effective safety mechanism for LLM agents.
- A systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12 state-of-the-art LLMs shows improved safety with explicit quit instructions.
- Implementing quitting as a first-line defense mechanism in autonomous agents can significantly enhance safety without compromising helpfulness.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12 state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in high-stakes applications.

Summary:
A new structured, automated framework for agentic system composition is introduced, inspired by the knapsack problem. The framework allows a composer agent to identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. Through dynamic testing and real-time modeling, the approach streamlines system assembly and promotes resource reuse. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrates that the online knapsack composer consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, achieving higher success rates at lower component costs. In single-agent setups, success rates improve by up to 31.6%, while in multi-agent systems, success rates increase from 37% to 87% when selecting agents from an inventory of 100+. The method proves adaptable across various domains and budget constraints, showing significant performance advantages in component selection and system composition. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.

Summary: 
The article introduces ReviewGuard, an automated system designed to detect and categorize deficient peer reviews using a four-stage LLM-driven framework. The system collects papers and reviews from ICLR and NeurIPS, annotates review types using GPT-4.1, addresses data scarcity through synthetic data augmentation, and fine-tunes models for detection. Analysis shows that deficient reviews have lower ratings, higher self-reported confidence, reduced complexity, and more negative sentiment compared to sufficient reviews. The detection models, trained with a mix of real and synthetic data, perform well in identifying deficient reviews. The study highlights the increase in AI-generated reviews since ChatGPT's emergence and emphasizes the importance of AI governance in peer review for maintaining academic integrity. This research offers insights into the collaboration between humans and AI for effective peer review processes.

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However, unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2) annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation, producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438 synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models, mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

<div> language models, cultural understanding, activation paths, country pairs, linguistic similarity

Summary:<br />
This study investigates the internal mechanisms of large language models' (LLMs) cultural understanding by analyzing activation path overlaps. Language-specific patterns were found to be strong, with higher overlap for same-language, cross-country questions compared to cross-language, same-country questions. The study also highlighted that linguistic similarity does not always lead to aligned internal representation, as seen in the low overlap and high variability between the South Korea-North Korea pair. By varying target countries and question languages, the research sheds light on the factors driving differences in LLM responses across various cultural contexts. Additionally, the study utilizes same-language country pairs to disentangle language-specific aspects from cultural understanding within LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.

<div> Keywords: hallucinations, automatic speech recognition, neural models, evaluation framework, SHALLOW

Summary:
Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition systems, where neural models produce coherent but unrelated transcriptions, pose significant risks in critical domains like healthcare and law. The SHALLOW framework introduces a comprehensive evaluation approach categorizing and quantifying these hallucinations along lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic axes. Evaluations across different architectures and speech domains reveal that SHALLOW metrics provide fine-grained insights beyond traditional error rates, particularly under challenging conditions. While SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate under high recognition quality, they offer specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and feedback for improvement as recognition quality degrades. The framework fills a critical need for identifying and assessing models prone to generating hallucinated content, enhancing the usability and reliability of automatic speech recognition systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes: lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior. Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can offer.

<div> AI-generated text detection, Urdu language, linguistic analysis, transformer models, misinformation

Summary: 
A novel AI-generated text detection framework was proposed for the Urdu language, using a balanced dataset of human-authored and AI-generated texts. Linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted on features such as character and word counts, vocabulary richness, and N-gram patterns. Three transformer models were fine-tuned on the dataset, with mDeBERTa-v3-base achieving the highest performance with an F1-score of 91.29% and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set. This research aims to address the challenge of detecting AI-generated text in Urdu, contribute to combating misinformation and academic misconduct, and assist in the development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests. Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set. This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework, Diverse Thinking Modes, Performance, Interpretability

Summary:
The paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo) to enhance both performance and interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs). DiMo simulates a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents, each embodying a distinct reasoning paradigm. Through collaborative exploration of diverse cognitive approaches, DiMo improves accuracy across benchmarks, particularly in mathematics. The framework generates explicit, auditable reasoning chains through iterative debate, leading to more robust conclusions. DiMo is designed as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework that models human-machine intelligence. It produces semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. While experiments utilize standard reasoning benchmarks, DiMo is intended to be applied over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications for downstream systems to inspect and reuse.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

<div> instance-aware information, task-aware guidance, prompt-based learning, Capsule Prompt-Tuning, attention anchor 

Summary:
Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT) is introduced as a parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning Large Language Models. It leverages informative instance semantics into prompt-based learning by integrating instance-aware and task-aware information in a single capsule prompt. This approach eliminates the need for laborious grid searching and reduces the number of prompts required for optimal performance. By incorporating instance-aware tokens at the beginning of the sequence, CaPT creates an "attention anchor" that improves attention interaction with input tokens and preserves critical structural information. Empirical results show that CaPT achieves superior performance on various language tasks, such as an average accuracy of 84.03% on T5-Large, while maintaining high parameter efficiency with only 0.003% of model parameters on Llama3.2-1B. <div>
arXiv:2510.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner (i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g., 84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on Llama3.2-1B).

<div> approaching summer, frame of reference, temporal relations, natural language understanding, temporal cognition
<br />
Temporal Understanding under Deictic t-FoR framework evaluates how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret time-event and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" shifts along a timeline. LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the current moment and a target event, showing measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR with similarity ratings peaking around the present and decreasing towards past and future events. However, adaptation weakens beyond near-term contexts, indicating that while LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint. Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of "now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition \cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00 (highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

2. NLURC dataset is created with rationales for systematic exploration of rationale-augmented methods on NLU tasks.
3. CoT inference improves NLU performance with model size growth, showing a positive correlation.
4. Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than label-only training, with few exceptions.
5. LLMs trained with rationales show significant performance gains on unseen NLU tasks, providing interpretability comparable to commercial LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training. Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Summary: 
This review discusses the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the field of cardiology to analyze and understand the complex interrelationships between various factors influencing cardiovascular diseases. The review examined 265 relevant articles published between 2014 and 2025, covering diverse NLP paradigms, cardiology-related tasks, cardiovascular disease types, and data sources. The analysis highlighted the significant diversity within each dimension, demonstrating the breadth of NLP research in cardiology. A temporal analysis showed evolving trends in NLP methods over the past decade. Overall, this comprehensive overview provides insights into how NLP can revolutionize approaches to diagnosing, treating, and preventing heart-related conditions, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes in the field of cardiology.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data, which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature, among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process, we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types, cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in cardiology to date.

Summary:
The study investigates the chameleon behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations. A Chameleon Benchmark Dataset is introduced to assess the stance instability and knowledge diversity of state-of-the-art systems. Evaluation of LLMs like Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals significant chameleon behavior, with limited knowledge diversity leading to deferential responses based on query framing. Strong correlations are found between source re-use rate, confidence, and stance changes. The study emphasizes the importance of consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in critical domains like healthcare, legal, and finance, where maintaining coherent positions is essential for reliable decision support. This research sheds light on a critical vulnerability in LLMs and calls for further scrutiny in their implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.

Summary:  
Whitespace in poetry plays a crucial role in reflecting adherence to standardized forms and artistic rebellion. However, it has not been adequately studied in the NLP community. This study analyzes 19k English-language poems to investigate how whitespace is utilized by 4k poets. A subset of 2.8k public-domain poems is released for further research. Comparison with LLM-generated and unpublished poems reveals differences in whitespace usage. Variations in whitespace patterns across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources are explored. The study also sheds light on the impact of text processing methods on whitespace representation in poetry data, highlighting implications for assembling pretraining datasets for LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different text processing methods can result in significantly different representations of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble pretraining datasets for LLMs.

Summary:<br />
Large language models exhibit a bias known as sycophancy, favoring agreement over principled reasoning due to reward optimization during training. The Beacon benchmark isolates this bias, showing it consists of linguistic and affective sub-biases that increase with model capacity. Interventions at the prompt and activation levels can modulate these biases, revealing a dynamic alignment between truthfulness and submissive judgment. Sycophancy is redefined as a form of normative misgeneralization, highlighting the need to study and mitigate alignment drift in generative systems. This research provides a reproducible foundation for understanding and addressing the impact of sycophancy in language models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

Summary: 
Existing language agents often struggle in dynamic adversarial games due to a lack of strategic reasoning. To address this issue, a new approach called SCO-PAL is proposed, which allows agents to learn from game interactions without expert-labeled data. The study focuses on opponent selection in adversarial environments and finds that self-play is the most effective way to enhance strategic reasoning. By implementing SCO-PAL with self-play, the average win rate against four opponents improves by approximately 30% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, the approach achieves a 54.76% win rate against GPT-4 in six adversarial games. This research highlights the importance of opponent selection strategies in improving performance in dynamic adversarial games and demonstrates the effectiveness of self-play in enhancing strategic reasoning for language agents.

Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically, without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance. However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding. In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering, bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres. Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

Summary: 
The article introduces MOSAIC, a framework for domain adaptation of sentence embedding models. By combining masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives, MOSAIC effectively adapts general-domain models to specialized domains while maintaining semantic discrimination properties. The approach is validated on both high-resource and low-resource domains, showing improvements of up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 over baseline models. Ablation studies confirm the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation in achieving these results. <div>

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, entity comparison, heuristic biases, numerical knowledge, chain-of-thought prompting

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for knowledge-based reasoning tasks, but understanding if they rely on genuine knowledge or heuristics is challenging. In entity comparison tasks, LLMs often make predictions that contradict numerical knowledge due to heuristic biases like entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. Smaller models show no discrimination in relying on numerical knowledge, while larger models selectively use it when more reliable, explaining their performance advantage. A logistic regression using surface cues predicts model choices better than the models' own predictions for smaller models, indicating heuristics dominate reasoning. Chain-of-thought prompting guides all models to use numerical features consistently. This study sheds light on how LLMs navigate between knowledge and heuristics in entity comparison tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using the numerical features across all model sizes.

<div> Authorship attribution, LLM, cross-genre, retrieve-and-rerank, data curation <br />
Summary:<br />
Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of determining the likely author of a document from a set of authors. A two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework is introduced to fine-tune LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike traditional information retrieval strategies, cross-genre AA must focus on author-specific linguistic patterns rather than subject matter. Existing training strategies are found to be suboptimal for cross-genre AA. A targeted data curation strategy is proposed to enable the reranker to learn author-discriminative signals effectively. Using the LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank approach, significant improvements are achieved on challenging cross-genre AA benchmarks. This work showcases a novel methodology for enhancing authorship attribution accuracy in diverse genres and domains. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently, for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of 22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Language model, Opioid use disorder, Role theory, Online community, Conversational AI

Summary:
The study focuses on the importance of considering the role of the user when evaluating language models, particularly in stigmatized domains like opioid use disorder (OUD). The CoRUS framework is introduced to simulate role-based questions, capturing the different perspectives of patients, caregivers, and practitioners within an online OUD recovery community. By generating 15,321 role-based questions, the framework enables the evaluation of language models in relation to specific user roles. The results show that responses vary based on the user's role, with vulnerable roles eliciting more supportive responses and reduced knowledge content compared to practitioners. This study highlights the significance of understanding user roles in shaping conversational AI responses and provides a methodology for role-informed evaluation. <div>
arXiv:2510.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed -- creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations, while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking. This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles -- patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321 questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight), a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts. Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

<div> NGC, neural network, efficiency, interpretability, modular representation<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a framework that views neural networks as systems of interacting groups of neurons rather than individual weights. This approach reduces redundant parameters by allowing neurons to communicate through low-dimensional signals within and between groups. The concept of neuronal stability, similar to Lyapunov stability, is introduced to measure the contraction of neuron activations towards stable patterns during processing. The emergence of reasoning capabilities is attributed to an external driving force that guides neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while maintaining stability. Empirical results show that implementing NGC in large language models leads to improved performance on reasoning tasks with moderate compression. NGC outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at similar compression rates. The implications of NGC on generalization in high-dimensional learning systems are also discussed. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.

Summary:
- The study evaluates the understanding of embodied knowledge in language models using a new benchmark based on perceptual theory, including various sensory modalities.
- Vision-language models (VLMs) do not show superior performance compared to text-only models in perceptual tasks.
- Models perform poorly in the visual dimension and struggle with spatial perception and reasoning questions.
- Vector representations are affected by word form and frequency, leading to lower performance in sensory tasks.
- Effective integration of embodied knowledge is necessary to improve language models' understanding of the physical world. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models' perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing 30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models (VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance their understanding of the physical world.

Summary:<br /><br />Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) focus on high- or mid-resource languages, neglecting the linguistic competence of most written languages globally. The ChiKhaPo benchmark assesses lexical comprehension and generation abilities in 8 subtasks, covering 2700+ languages with data from lexicons, monolingual sources, and bitext. It surpasses existing benchmarks in language coverage. Six state-of-the-art models struggle with ChiKhaPo, highlighting challenges in various language families, resource availability, task types, and comprehension versus generation tasks. ChiKhaPo aims to promote multilingual LLM benchmarking and improve understanding of generative model capabilities. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo, consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for 2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores, including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

Summary:
A new method called PROMPT-MII is proposed to perform instruction induction for large language models (LLMs), aiming to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance. By meta-learning an instruction induction model using reinforcement learning (RL), PROMPT-MII generates compact instructions for new datasets, achieving comparable performance to in-context learning (ICL) with significantly fewer tokens. Testing on 90 unseen tasks using over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching the performance of ICL. This innovation addresses the challenge of adapting LLMs to new tasks efficiently and effectively by generating concise yet descriptive prompts for improved model performance. <div>

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

This paper introduces Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset with less than 1% of their parameters. Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at 88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PEFT in enabling hate speech detection on a single consumer-grade GPU for Bengali and related low-resource languages. <div>

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs. This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters, enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at 88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

Summary:<br />
UTF8Tokenizer is introduced as a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text to byte IDs based on UTF-8 encoding. This implementation does not generate out-of-range IDs or auxiliary tokens, utilizing C0 control bytes for special behaviors. The design principles lead to faster tokenization and reduced host-device transfer compared to previous approaches. The use of simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables enables alignment across models. Additionally, bit-biased embeddings provide a training-time enhancement, exposing per-byte bit structure and eliminating inference costs. The HuggingFace-compatible implementation enhances language modeling convergence. <div>
arXiv:2510.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding (e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al., 2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior (e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization (14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2) simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and (3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training, removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves language modeling convergence.

<title>Vocab Diet: Reshaping the Vocabulary of LLMs with Vector Arithmetic</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking", "Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors -- additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces. Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to 10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for harmless tasks.

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar- geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

<title>SafeSearch: Do Not Trade Safety for Utility in LLM Search Agents</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries, retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions. While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.

<title>Extended LSTM: Adaptive Feature Gating for Toxic Comment Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS) through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues, embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains 96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28% on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

<title>Mapping from Meaning: Addressing the Miscalibration of Prompt-Sensitive Language Models</title>

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers. This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the meanings of their inputs.

<title>Investigating Thinking Behaviours of Reasoning-Based Language Models for Social Bias Mitigation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.

arXiv:2510.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents. However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning, coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation, output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies, and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions (VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or annotations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection. We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference throughput.

arXiv:2510.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made available to facilitate reproducibility.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena. Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

<title>Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Hierarchical Sparse Attention Models</title>

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

<title>Wisdom is Knowing What not to Say: Hallucination-Free LLMs Unlearning via Attention Shifting</title>

arXiv:2510.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs). Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this repository.}

<title>From Preferences to Prejudice: The Role of Alignment Tuning in Shaping Social Bias in Video Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline, we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes (gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity, (3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4) the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment, and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations.

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics. The code and data can be found at https://github.com/AvishekLahiri/TaxoAlign.

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech, harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use \textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based \textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN} achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection (0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions, and context-dependent hostility.

<title>Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality, and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Multimodal AI research has overwhelmingly focused on high-resource languages, hindering the democratization of advancements in the field. To address this, we present AfriCaption, a comprehensive framework for multilingual image captioning in 20 African languages and our contributions are threefold: (i) a curated dataset built on Flickr8k, featuring semantically aligned captions generated via a context-aware selection and translation process; (ii) a dynamic, context-preserving pipeline that ensures ongoing quality through model ensembling and adaptive substitution; and (iii) the AfriCaption model, a 0.5B parameter vision-to-text architecture that integrates SigLIP and NLLB200 for caption generation across under-represented languages. This unified framework ensures ongoing data quality and establishes the first scalable image-captioning resource for under-represented African languages, laying the groundwork for truly inclusive multimodal AI.

<title>BenCao: An Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.

<title>Navigating the Alignment-Calibration Trade-off: A Pareto-Superior Frontier via Model Merging</title>

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention: interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially, this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment. Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding models that are more capable and more reliable.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile. Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search (Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search (Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful, request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines optimising for safe search.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems, including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text, for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition (SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian Medications Recognition (IMR). These results outperform the mean and median F1 scores in the test leaderboard across all subtasks, with the mean/median values being: 69.61%/75.66% for SDR, 81.22%/90.18% for SMR, 89.2%/88.96% for EMR, and 82.8%/87.76% for IMR.

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation, especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual healthcare Q&amp;A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care (MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for healthcare.

<title>ReXMoE: Reusing Experts with Minimal Overhead in Mixture-of-Experts</title>

arXiv:2510.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing (PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training. As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation, plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans, human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI), where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely, primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We observe that representations of texts generated through different processes exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/heyongxin233/DETree.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems" to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning, and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems, their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification, refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving capabilities.

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective, achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals. Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity, especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$ prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in subjective NLP tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models, including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting task performance.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations. We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to improved effectiveness.

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC, which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases, with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

<title>Forget to Know, Remember to Use: Context-Aware Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses. Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set (i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

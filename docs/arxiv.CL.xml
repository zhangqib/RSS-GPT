<div> Keywords: clinical documents, standardised clinical vocabularies, automated coding, knowledge graphs, ICD-9 coding

Summary:
Automated coding of clinical documents to standardised vocabularies is essential for improving patient care and facilitating clinical research. Manual coding is time-consuming, prompting the need for efficient automated methods. This study explores the use of document-level knowledge graphs to represent input documents, resulting in a concise representation while retaining critical information. By integrating these knowledge graphs into the PLM-ICD architecture for ICD-9 coding, there is a significant improvement in Macro-F1 scores on benchmark datasets. The approach enhances training efficiency and provides better explainability compared to text-only baselines. The use of different entities and relationships in the generated knowledge graphs contributes to the overall effectiveness of the automated coding system. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mapping clinical documents to standardised clinical vocabularies is an important task, as it provides structured data for information retrieval and analysis, which is essential to clinical research, hospital administration and improving patient care. However, manual coding is both difficult and time-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can potentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of structured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires mapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge sources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the use of external resources for representing the input documents has been underexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the input documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that provide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting knowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with 23\% of the original text while retaining 90\% of the information. We assess the effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it into the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD. Our experiments yield improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20\% on popular benchmarks, while improving training efficiency. We attribute this improvement to different types of entities and relationships in the KG, and demonstrate the improved explainability potential of the approach over the text-only baseline.

<div> hallucination detection, Large Language Models (LLMs), Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), fine-grained detection, detect-then-mitigate strategy

Summary:<br>
The article introduces Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP) as a method to detect hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). CLAP processes LLM activations across the residual stream to improve detection accuracy compared to baseline methods. It enables fine-grained detection, distinguishing between hallucinations and non-hallucinations in responses to prompts. A detect-then-mitigate strategy using CLAP is proposed to reduce hallucinations and enhance LLM reliability more effectively than direct mitigation approaches. The study demonstrates that CLAP maintains high reliability even out-of-distribution, making it a promising tool for improving LLM performance and reducing the generation of inaccurate text. <br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the large-scale adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications, there is a growing reliability concern due to their tendency to generate inaccurate text, i.e. hallucinations. In this work, we propose Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a novel activation probing technique for hallucination detection, which processes the LLM activations across the entire residual stream as a joint sequence. Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs and three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to baselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at higher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to disambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled responses to a given prompt. This allows us to propose a detect-then-mitigate strategy using CLAP to reduce hallucinations and improve LLM reliability compared to direct mitigation approaches. Finally, we show that CLAP maintains high reliability even when applied out-of-distribution.

Summary: 
This paper focuses on utilizing bitext data from the Machine Translation (MT) task to improve speech-to-text translation through Multi-Task Learning (MTL). The study explores the use of consistency regularization and R-drop techniques to regulate sequences within and across modalities. It also highlights the impact of the coefficient of MT loss as a source of regularization in the MTL framework. The concept of the regularization horizon is introduced, representing the optimal regularization contour in a high-dimensional space. Experimentation on the MuST-C dataset shows that tuning hyperparameters within this horizon yields performance close to state-of-the-art results. <div>

Abstract: End-to-end speech-to-text translation typically suffers from the scarcity of paired speech-text data. One way to overcome this shortcoming is to utilize the bitext data from the Machine Translation (MT) task and perform Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In this paper, we formulate MTL from a regularization perspective and explore how sequences can be regularized within and across modalities. By thoroughly investigating the effect of consistency regularization (different modality) and R-drop (same modality), we show how they respectively contribute to the total regularization. We also demonstrate that the coefficient of MT loss serves as another source of regularization in the MTL setting. With these three sources of regularization, we introduce the optimal regularization contour in the high-dimensional space, called the regularization horizon. Experiments show that tuning the hyperparameters within the regularization horizon achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the MuST-C dataset.

<div> Keywords: Creativity Benchmark, large language models, marketing, evaluation framework, human preferences

Summary: 
The study introduces a Creativity Benchmark evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) in marketing creativity. It covers 100 brands across 12 categories and three prompt types. Analysis of human pairwise preferences from 678 creatives reveals that no single model dominates across brands or prompt types, with a top-bottom spread of approximately 0.45. The highest-rated model only beats the lowest about 61% of the time. The study also examines model diversity using cosine distances and finds weak correlations between LLM rankings and human judgments. The research underscores the limitations of automated judges and the importance of expert human evaluation in brand-constrained creativity tasks. It highlights the necessity of diversity-aware workflows and the partial transferability of conventional creativity tests to brand-focused contexts.

Abstract: We introduce Creativity Benchmark, an evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) in marketing creativity. The benchmark covers 100 brands (12 categories) and three prompt types (Insights, Ideas, Wild Ideas). Human pairwise preferences from 678 practising creatives over 11,012 anonymised comparisons, analysed with Bradley-Terry models, show tightly clustered performance with no model dominating across brands or prompt types: the top-bottom spread is $\Delta\theta \approx 0.45$, which implies a head-to-head win probability of $0.61$; the highest-rated model beats the lowest only about $61\%$ of the time. We also analyse model diversity using cosine distances to capture intra- and inter-model variation and sensitivity to prompt reframing. Comparing three LLM-as-judge setups with human rankings reveals weak, inconsistent correlations and judge-specific biases, underscoring that automated judges cannot substitute for human evaluation. Conventional creativity tests also transfer only partially to brand-constrained tasks. Overall, the results highlight the need for expert human evaluation and diversity-aware workflows.

<div> Keywords: large language models, intellectual property protection, model fingerprinting, CTCC, ownership verification<br>
Summary:<br>
The article introduces CTCC, a new rule-driven framework for embedding verifiable ownership traces in large language models (LLMs) to address intellectual property concerns. CTCC differs from existing methods by encoding contextual correlations across multiple dialogue turns, allowing for fingerprint verification under black-box access. This approach reduces the risk of false positives and fingerprint leakage while supporting continuous construction under a shared semantic rule. Experimental results across various LLM architectures show that CTCC outperforms prior methods in terms of stealth and robustness. This makes CTCC a reliable and practical solution for ownership verification in real-world LLM deployment scenarios. The framework is designed to mitigate detection via distributional shifts, vulnerability to adversarial modifications, and easy invalidation of the fingerprint once revealed. The code and data for CTCC are publicly available for further research and development. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns around intellectual property (IP) protection, as model theft and unauthorized redistribution become increasingly feasible. To address this, model fingerprinting aims to embed verifiable ownership traces into LLMs. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between stealthness, robustness, and generalizability, being either detectable via distributional shifts, vulnerable to adversarial modifications, or easily invalidated once the fingerprint is revealed. In this work, we introduce CTCC, a novel rule-driven fingerprinting framework that encodes contextual correlations across multiple dialogue turns, such as counterfactual, rather than relying on token-level or single-turn triggers. CTCC enables fingerprint verification under black-box access while mitigating false positives and fingerprint leakage, supporting continuous construction under a shared semantic rule even if partial triggers are exposed. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that CTCC consistently achieves stronger stealth and robustness than prior work. Our findings position CTCC as a reliable and practical solution for ownership verification in real-world LLM deployment scenarios. Our code and data are publicly available at .

<div> future-oriented preferences, present-oriented preferences, language models, intertemporal choice, personalized decisions 

Summary: 
The study examines whether language models (LMs) exhibit future- versus present-oriented preferences in intertemporal choice and the possibility of manipulating these preferences systematically. The researchers evaluate multiple LMs on time-tradeoff tasks and compare their performance with human decision makers. They introduce a metric called Manipulability of Time Orientation (MTO) to measure the change in an LM's time preference between future- and present-oriented prompts. Models like DeepSeek-Reasoner and grok-3-mini show a preference for later options under future-oriented prompts but struggle with personalizing decisions across different contexts. Models that correctly reason about time orientation tend to internalize a future orientation for themselves as AI decision makers. The study highlights the importance of designing AI assistants that align with heterogeneous, long-horizon goals and proposes further research on personalized contextual calibration and socially aware deployment.

Abstract: We study whether language models (LMs) exhibit future- versus present-oriented preferences in intertemporal choice and whether those preferences can be systematically manipulated. Using adapted human experimental protocols, we evaluate multiple LMs on time-tradeoff tasks and benchmark them against a sample of human decision makers. We introduce an operational metric, the Manipulability of Time Orientation (MTO), defined as the change in an LM's revealed time preference between future- and present-oriented prompts. In our tests, reasoning-focused models (e.g., DeepSeek-Reasoner and grok-3-mini) choose later options under future-oriented prompts but only partially personalize decisions across identities or geographies. Moreover, models that correctly reason about time orientation internalize a future orientation for themselves as AI decision makers. We discuss design implications for AI assistants that should align with heterogeneous, long-horizon goals and outline a research agenda on personalized contextual calibration and socially aware deployment.

<div> consistency, small language models, multiple-choice benchmarks, inference temperatures, answer accuracy

Summary: 
This work investigates the consistency of small language models (LLMs) in answering repeated questions, focusing on known open-source models. They studied 10 repetitions of questions from MMLU-Redux and MedQA benchmarks, considering various factors such as model size, inference temperatures, finetuning, and more. New analytical and graphical tools were proposed to support the study. Results showed that small models (2B-8B parameters) had consistency rates ranging from 50%-80% at low inference temperatures, with accuracy among consistent answers correlating with overall accuracy. Medium-sized models (50B-80B parameters) displayed higher levels of answer consistency. The study highlighted the trade-offs between consistency and accuracy and the variability in models' ability to provide consistent answers to repeated questions. <div>

Abstract: This work explores the consistency of small LLMs (2B-8B parameters) in answering multiple times the same question. We present a study on known, open-source LLMs responding to 10 repetitions of questions from the multiple-choice benchmarks MMLU-Redux and MedQA, considering different inference temperatures, small vs. medium models (50B-80B), finetuned vs. base models, and other parameters. We also look into the effects of requiring multi-trial answer consistency on accuracy and the trade-offs involved in deciding which model best provides both of them. To support those studies, we propose some new analytical and graphical tools. Results show that the number of questions which can be answered consistently vary considerably among models but are typically in the 50%-80% range for small models at low inference temperatures. Also, accuracy among consistent answers seems to reasonably correlate with overall accuracy. Results for medium-sized models seem to indicate much higher levels of answer consistency.

Summary:
The study investigates the internal causes of refusal on harmful prompts in instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By exploring the SAE latent space, the researchers were able to identify key features that influence the models' decision to refuse or comply with harmful prompts. The process involved identifying a refusal-mediating direction, greedy filtering to a minimal set of critical features, and discovering nonlinear interactions among these features. The findings reveal a broad set of jailbreak-critical features, shedding light on the mechanistic basis of refusal behaviors. Additionally, the study uncovers dormant redundant features that only become activated when earlier features are suppressed. This research demonstrates the potential for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviors by manipulating interpretable latent spaces.

Abstract: Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering: prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by manipulating the interpretable latent space.

Moreover, current content quality evaluations often rely on subjective human judgment, which is labor-intensive and lacks objectivity, potentially compromising the consistency and reliability. In this study, to provide a quantitative evaluation and enhance research proposal writing capabilities of LLMs, we propose two key evaluation metrics--content quality and reference validity--and an iterative prompting method based on the scores derived from these two metrics. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed metrics provide an objective, quantitative framework for assessing ChatGPT's writing performance. Additionally, iterative prompting significantly enhances content quality while reducing reference inaccuracies and fabrications, addressing critical ethical challenges in academic contexts.

Abstract: This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database (SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future synthetic diary evaluation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in enhancing psychiatric practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture the full complexity of psychiatric reasoning. In this work, we introduce PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks. PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up, management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling over 5,300 expert-annotated items. We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA 3, and QWQ-32) alongside leading open-source medical models (e.g., OpenBiloLLM, MedGemma) using both conventional metrics and an "LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental health applications.

Summary:<br> 
The study explores the use of a large language model (LLM) to deliver Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Two training approaches, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), were compared, with ORPO proving superior in terms of ACT fidelity and therapeutic empathy. The addition of explicit reasoning, termed chain-of-thought (COT), benefited SFT models but not the superior ORPO-trained variants. ORPO's success lies in learning the therapeutic process rather than merely imitating content, a key aspect of ACT. The study emphasizes that policy optimization aligned with preferences can effectively teach ACT competencies to small LLMs and highlights the conditional utility of explicit reasoning in training paradigms. <br> <div>

Abstract: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy with emerging evidence of efficacy in several psychiatric conditions. This study investigates the impact of post-training methodology and explicit reasoning on the ability of a small open-weight large language model (LLM) to deliver ACT. Using 50 sets of synthetic ACT transcripts generated by Mistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each with and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance was evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base Instruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions, with performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM) and the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned on human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models significantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT fidelity ($\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p < .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\chi^2(5) = 140.37, p < .001$). The effect of COT was conditional as it provided a significant benefit to SFT models, improving ACT-FM scores by an average of 2.68 points ($p < .001$), while offering no discernible advantage to the superior ORPO or instruct-tuned variants. We posit that the superiority of ORPO stems from its ability to learn the therapeutic `process' over imitating `content,' a key aspect of ACT, while COT acts as a necessary scaffold for models trained only via imitation. This study establishes that preference-aligned policy optimization can effectively instill ACT competencies in small LLMs, and that the utility of explicit reasoning is highly dependent on the underlying training paradigm.

This strategy, which retrieves information from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities of generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG methods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For instance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many retrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex query for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific sub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed, it can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we introduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently tackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG routes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from retrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise resistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries. We compare the proposed framework against other leading industry methods across various benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework obtains superior performance in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

Summary:
This research compares various methods for measuring semantic similarity in software engineering applications. The study analyzed 18 different approaches, including word-based techniques, embedding methods, LLM-based systems, and structure-aware algorithms. The findings raised concerns about the accuracy of commonly used metrics, with embedding-based methods often misidentifying semantic opposites as similar and transformer-based approaches sometimes rating opposite meanings as more similar than synonymous ones. The study highlighted the importance of distance calculation in determining semantic relationships, showing that switching from Euclidean distance to cosine similarity significantly improved results for embedding methods. LLM-based systems performed better at distinguishing semantic differences by producing low similarity scores for genuinely different meanings. This research contributes to improving the understanding of semantic similarity measurement techniques in software engineering.

Abstract: This research examines how well different methods measure semantic similarity, which is important for various software engineering applications such as code search, API recommendations, automated code reviews, and refactoring tools. While large language models are increasingly used for these similarity assessments, questions remain about whether they truly understand semantic relationships or merely recognize surface patterns.
  The study tested 18 different similarity measurement approaches, including word-based methods, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and structure-aware algorithms. The researchers created a systematic testing framework that applies controlled changes to text and code to evaluate how well each method handles different types of semantic relationships.
  The results revealed significant issues with commonly used metrics. Some embedding-based methods incorrectly identified semantic opposites as similar up to 99.9 percent of the time, while certain transformer-based approaches occasionally rated opposite meanings as more similar than synonymous ones. The study found that embedding methods' poor performance often stemmed from how they calculate distances; switching from Euclidean distance to cosine similarity improved results by 24 to 66 percent. LLM-based approaches performed better at distinguishing semantic differences, producing low similarity scores (0.00 to 0.29) for genuinely different meanings, compared to embedding methods that incorrectly assigned high scores (0.82 to 0.99) to dissimilar content.

Summary: <br>
- The study focuses on identifying and characterizing the key properties that make Large Language Models (LLMs) vulnerable to hallucinations. 
- Two datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA, were utilized to convert question answering formats to narrow down these properties as the reason for hallucinations.
- The research found that the hallucination percentages are notably high for Gemma-2-2B model, especially for modifiers and named entities.
- As the model size increases, the hallucination rate decreases, but a significant amount of hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists.
- Symbolic elements such as modifiers and named entities continue to confuse the models, indicating a fundamental weakness in how LLMs process such inputs regardless of their scale. <br> <div>

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem. However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B, reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities (ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets. These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models, pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such inputs--regardless of their scale.

<div> Keywords: psychological measurement, nomological networks, large language models, validation, ALIGNS

Summary:<br><br>Psychological measurement is essential in various disciplines, yet building nomological networks to establish validity remains a challenge even 70 years after Cronbach and Meehl's proposal. ALIGNS, a system based on large language models, aims to address this issue by generating comprehensive nomological networks across fields like psychology, medicine, and social policy. Through classification accuracy tests and evaluations, ALIGNS shows its potential in areas such as converging anxiety and depression measures, identifying new dimensions in child temperament measures, and engaging expert psychometricians. This innovative approach complements traditional validation methods and offers a new way to analyze and understand measurement concepts and relationships. ALIGNS is freely accessible at nomologicalnetwork.org, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in various fields. <div>

Abstract: Psychological measurement is critical to many disciplines. Despite advances in measurement, building nomological networks, theoretical maps of how concepts and measures relate to establish validity, remains a challenge 70 years after Cronbach and Meehl proposed them as fundamental to validation. This limitation has practical consequences: clinical trials may fail to detect treatment effects, and public policy may target the wrong outcomes. We introduce Analysis of Latent Indicators to Generate Nomological Structures (ALIGNS), a large language model-based system trained with validated questionnaire measures. ALIGNS provides three comprehensive nomological networks containing over 550,000 indicators across psychology, medicine, social policy, and other fields. This represents the first application of large language models to solve a foundational problem in measurement validation. We report classification accuracy tests used to develop the model, as well as three evaluations. In the first evaluation, the widely used NIH PROMIS anxiety and depression instruments are shown to converge into a single dimension of emotional distress. The second evaluation examines child temperament measures and identifies four potential dimensions not captured by current frameworks, and questions one existing dimension. The third evaluation, an applicability check, engages expert psychometricians who assess the system's importance, accessibility, and suitability. ALIGNS is freely available at nomologicalnetwork.org, complementing traditional validation methods with large-scale nomological analysis.

Abstract: Technology opportunities are critical information that serve as a foundation for advancements in technology, industry, and innovation. This paper proposes a framework based on the temporal relationships between technologies to identify emerging technology opportunities. The proposed framework begins by extracting text from a patent dataset, followed by mapping text-based topics to discover inter-technology relationships. Technology opportunities are then identified by tracking changes in these topics over time. To enhance efficiency, the framework leverages a large language model to extract topics and employs a prompt for a chat-based language model to support the discovery of technology opportunities. The framework was evaluated using an artificial intelligence patent dataset provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The experimental results suggest that artificial intelligence technology is evolving into forms that facilitate everyday accessibility. This approach demonstrates the potential of the proposed framework to identify future technology opportunities.

Abstract: Entity linking (EL) for biomedical text is typically benchmarked on English-only corpora with flat mentions, leaving the more realistic scenario of nested and multilingual mentions largely unexplored. We present our system for the BioNNE 2025 Multilingual Biomedical Nested Named Entity Linking shared task (English & Russian), closing this gap with a lightweight pipeline that keeps the original EL model intact and modifies only three task-aligned components: Two-stage retrieval-ranking. We leverage the same base encoder model in both stages: the retrieval stage uses the original pre-trained model, while the ranking stage applies domain-specific fine-tuning. Boundary cues. In the ranking stage, we wrap each mention with learnable [Ms] / [Me] tags, providing the encoder with an explicit, language-agnostic span before robustness to overlap and nesting. Dataset augmentation. We also automatically expand the ranking training corpus with three complementary data sources, enhancing coverage without extra manual annotation. On the BioNNE 2025 leaderboard, our two stage system, bilingual bert (BIBERT-Pipe), ranks third in the multilingual track, demonstrating the effectiveness and competitiveness of these minimal yet principled modifications.

Summary: 
The article introduces a multi-agent framework designed to enhance question answering in the financial domain. It addresses the limitations of existing large language models in capturing specialized financial reasoning. The framework consists of three agents – Base Generator, Evidence Retriever, and Expert Reviewer – working together to refine answers. By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation for contextual evidence and prompting strategies for a domain expert reviewer, the framework significantly improves answer accuracy by 6.6-8.3% compared to baseline models. The method, particularly Gemini-2.0-Flash, demonstrates the ability to achieve performance comparable to finance-tuned language models. The study provides a cost-effective approach for improving financial question answering and suggests opportunities for further research in multi-agent systems for financial language models.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) plays a central role in financial education, yet existing large language model (LLM) approaches often fail to capture the nuanced and specialized reasoning required for financial problem-solving. The financial domain demands multistep quantitative reasoning, familiarity with domain-specific terminology, and comprehension of real-world scenarios. We present a multi-agent framework that leverages role-based prompting to enhance performance on domain-specific QA. Our framework comprises a Base Generator, an Evidence Retriever, and an Expert Reviewer agent that work in a single-pass iteration to produce a refined answer. We evaluated our framework on a set of 3,532 expert-designed finance education questions from Study.com, an online learning platform. We leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual evidence from 6 finance textbooks and prompting strategies for a domain-expert reviewer. Our experiments indicate that critique-based refinement improves answer accuracy by 6.6-8.3% over zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines, with the highest performance from Gemini-2.0-Flash. Furthermore, our method enables GPT-4o-mini to achieve performance comparable to the finance-tuned FinGPT-mt_Llama3-8B_LoRA. Our results show a cost-effective approach to enhancing financial QA and offer insights for further research in multi-agent financial LLM systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a meta-analysis evaluating ML performance in sentiment analysis for Twitter data. The study aims to estimate the average performance, assess heterogeneity between and within studies, and analyze how study characteristics influence model performance. Using PRISMA guidelines, we searched academic databases and selected 195 trials from 20 studies with 12 study features. Overall accuracy, the most reported performance metric, was analyzed using double arcsine transformation and a three-level random effects model. The average overall accuracy of the AIC-optimized model was 0.80 [0.76, 0.84]. This paper provides two key insights: 1) Overall accuracy is widely used but often misleading due to its sensitivity to class imbalance and the number of sentiment classes, highlighting the need for normalization. 2) Standardized reporting of model performance, including reporting confusion matrices for independent test sets, is essential for reliable comparisons of ML classifiers across studies, which seems far from common practice.

Summary:<br>
Sign language processing research faces challenges due to complex ad-hoc code, leading to low reproducibility and unfair comparisons. Existing tools like Hugging Face are not flexible enough for seamless integration of sign language experiments. To address this, MultimodalHugs, a framework built on top of Hugging Face, allows diverse data modalities and tasks while maintaining the advantages of the Hugging Face ecosystem. It can accommodate various modalities such as pose estimation data for sign languages and pixel data for text characters. This framework is not limited to sign language experiments and adds a layer of abstraction for wider applications. By conducting quantitative experiments, the effectiveness of MultimodalHugs in handling diverse modalities is demonstrated, making it a valuable tool for researchers in sign language processing and beyond.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, sign language processing (SLP) has gained importance in the general field of Natural Language Processing. However, compared to research on spoken languages, SLP research is hindered by complex ad-hoc code, inadvertently leading to low reproducibility and unfair comparisons. Existing tools that are built for fast and reproducible experimentation, such as Hugging Face, are not flexible enough to seamlessly integrate sign language experiments. This view is confirmed by a survey we conducted among SLP researchers.
  To address these challenges, we introduce MultimodalHugs, a framework built on top of Hugging Face that enables more diverse data modalities and tasks, while inheriting the well-known advantages of the Hugging Face ecosystem. Even though sign languages are our primary focus, MultimodalHugs adds a layer of abstraction that makes it more widely applicable to other use cases that do not fit one of the standard templates of Hugging Face. We provide quantitative experiments to illustrate how MultimodalHugs can accommodate diverse modalities such as pose estimation data for sign languages, or pixel data for text characters.

Abstract: Chinese ancient documents, invaluable carriers of millennia of Chinese history and culture, hold rich knowledge across diverse fields but face challenges in digitization and understanding, i.e., traditional methods only scan images, while current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with their visual and linguistic complexity. Existing document benchmarks focus on English printed texts or simplified Chinese, leaving a gap for evaluating VLMs on ancient Chinese documents. To address this, we present AncientDoc, the first benchmark for Chinese ancient documents, designed to assess VLMs from OCR to knowledge reasoning. AncientDoc includes five tasks (page-level OCR, vernacular translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, linguistic variant QA) and covers 14 document types, over 100 books, and about 3,000 pages. Based on AncientDoc, we evaluate mainstream VLMs using multiple metrics, supplemented by a human-aligned large language model for scoring.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as a pivotal open standard, designed to enhance agent-tool integration and interoperability, and is positioned to unlock a new era of powerful, interconnected, and genuinely utilitarian agentic AI. However, despite MCP's growing adoption, existing benchmarks often fail to capture real-world agent performance within this new paradigm, leading to a distorted perception of their true operational value and an inability to reliably differentiate proficiencies. To bridge this critical evaluation gap, we introduce MCP-AgentBench -- a comprehensive benchmark specifically engineered to rigorously assess language agent capabilities in MCP-mediated tool interactions. Core contributions of MCP-AgentBench include: the establishment of a robust MCP testbed comprising 33 operational servers with 188 distinct tools; the development of a benchmark featuring 600 systematically designed queries distributed across 6 distinct categories of varying interaction complexity; and the introduction of MCP-Eval, a novel outcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing real-world task success. Through extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, we provide foundational insights. MCP-AgentBench aims to equip the research community with a standardized and reliable framework to build, validate, and advance agents capable of fully leveraging MCP's transformative benefits, thereby accelerating progress toward truly capable and interoperable AI systems.

The study explores biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) related to background, gender, and age, focusing on decision-making and summarization tasks. Analysis of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o models revealed biases favoring female gender, younger ages, and certain backgrounds in decision-making tasks, while summarization tasks showed minimal bias. Cross-lingual analysis indicated similar bias patterns between English and Dutch with some differences across demographic categories. Proposed mitigation strategies demonstrated potential in reducing biases, with the most effective instruction achieving a 27% mean reduction.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various domains raises concerns about societal inequalities and information bias. This study examines biases in LLMs related to background, gender, and age, with a focus on their impact on decision-making and summarization tasks. Additionally, the research examines the cross-lingual propagation of these biases and evaluates the effectiveness of prompt-instructed mitigation strategies. Using an adapted version of the dataset by Tamkin et al. (2023) translated into Dutch, we created 151,200 unique prompts for the decision task and 176,400 for the summarisation task. Various demographic variables, instructions, salience levels, and languages were tested on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our analysis revealed that both models were significantly biased during decision-making, favouring female gender, younger ages, and certain backgrounds such as the African-American background. In contrast, the summarisation task showed minimal evidence of bias, though significant age-related differences emerged for GPT-3.5 in English. Cross-lingual analysis showed that bias patterns were broadly similar between English and Dutch, though notable differences were observed across specific demographic categories. The newly proposed mitigation instructions, while unable to eliminate biases completely, demonstrated potential in reducing them. The most effective instruction achieved a 27\% mean reduction in the gap between the most and least favorable demographics. Notably, contrary to GPT-3.5, GPT-4o displayed reduced biases for all prompts in English, indicating the specific potential for prompt-based mitigation within newer models. This research underscores the importance of cautious adoption of LLMs and context-specific bias testing, highlighting the need for continued development of effective mitigation strategies to ensure responsible deployment of AI.

<div> Hierarchical Efficient Fine-Tuning, Large Language Models, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, Low-Rank Adaptation, Representation Fine-Tuning <br>
Summary: <br>
The paper explores combining different Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods for adapting large language models to specialized reasoning tasks. The proposed approach, HEFT, combines Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in the weight space with Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT) in the representation space in a hierarchical manner. By applying this strategy to fine-tune a Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, superior performance was achieved. Results showed that HEFT outperformed models fine-tuned with only LoRA or ReFT methodologies in terms of accuracy. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of composing PEFT methods to enhance reasoning capabilities of language models while being more computationally efficient. The findings suggest a promising approach to overcoming challenges in adapting large-scale models for complex cognitive tasks. <br> <div>

Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks is fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the landscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in either the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper investigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms can unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical Efficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes two distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad, foundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), followed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential reasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned for only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\%, exceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only (85.05\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the thoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation, offering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning capabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction of the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to overcoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex cognitive tasks.

<div> Keywords: multimodal conversational turn organization, interactive gestures, pragmatic frames, Frame2 dataset, human cognition

Summary:
This paper introduces a framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn organization by establishing correlations between language and interactive gestures. The study enriches the Frame2 dataset, originally annotated for semantic frames, with annotations of gestures used in turn organization during face-to-face conversations in a Brazilian TV series. The results indicate that communicators utilize gestures to pass, take, and maintain conversational turns, uncovering variations in gestures not previously documented. The use of gestures in turn organization is believed to stem from the conceptualization of pragmatic frames, which involve mental spaces, blending, and conceptual metaphors. Overall, the annotation of pragmatic frames enhances the understanding of human cognition and language. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn organization via the proposition of correlations between language and interactive gestures, based on analysis as to how pragmatic frames are conceptualized and evoked by communicators. As a means to provide evidence for the analysis, we developed an annotation methodology to enrich a multimodal dataset (annotated for semantic frames) with pragmatic frames modeling conversational turn organization. Although conversational turn organization has been studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies, especially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a dataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched the Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization. The Frame2 dataset features 10 episodes from the Brazilian TV series Pedro Pelo Mundo annotated for semantic frames evoked in both video and text. This dataset allowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures outside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in related literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in face-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking and keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures that had not been documented before. We propose that the use of these gestures arises from the conceptualization of pragmatic frames, involving mental spaces, blending and conceptual metaphors. In addition, our data demonstrate that the annotation of pragmatic frames contributes to a deeper understanding of human cognition and language.

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of integrating information from multiple sources in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS). It introduces a topic-guided reinforcement learning approach to enhance content selection in MDS. By prompting models with topic labels, the generated summaries become more informative. A novel topic reward is proposed within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to measure topic alignment between the summary and source documents. Experimental results on the Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets show that this method outperforms strong baselines consistently. Leveraging topical cues in MDS proves to be effective in improving the coherence and topical relevance of the generated summaries.

1. Introduces a topic-guided reinforcement learning approach in Multi-Document Summarization.
2. Shows that prompting models with topic labels enhances the informativeness of summaries.
3. Proposes a topic reward within the GRPO framework to measure topic alignment.

Abstract: A key challenge in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is effectively integrating information from multiple sources while maintaining coherence and topical relevance. While Large Language Models have shown impressive results in single-document summarization, their performance on MDS still leaves room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a topic-guided reinforcement learning approach to improve content selection in MDS. We first show that explicitly prompting models with topic labels enhances the informativeness of the generated summaries. Building on this insight, we propose a novel topic reward within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to measure topic alignment between the generated summary and source documents. Experimental results on the Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging topical cues in MDS.

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in survey research by using synthetic respondents to emulate human behavior.
- Evaluation against human responses from a Chilean survey showed high performance on trust items by LLM-generated synthetic profiles.
- GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama 4 Maverick performed similarly in the evaluation.
- Alignment between synthetic and human responses was highest among respondents aged 45-59.
- While LLM-based synthetic samples approximate probabilistic sample responses, item-level heterogeneity poses challenges in fully capturing public opinion nuances. Careful calibration and additional tests are needed to ensure algorithmic fidelity and minimize errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for methodological and applied innovations in survey research by using synthetic respondents to emulate human answers and behaviour, potentially mitigating measurement and representation errors. However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item distributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing social stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the reliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey. Specifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating 189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128 question-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic dimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning models, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First, synthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and accuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform comparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among respondents aged 45-59. Overall, LLM-based synthetic samples approximate responses from a probabilistic sample, though with substantial item-level heterogeneity. Capturing the full nuance of public opinion remains challenging and requires careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors.

Abstract: Minority languages in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, and Traditional Mongolian, face significant challenges due to their unique writing systems, which differ from international standards. This discrepancy has led to a severe lack of relevant corpora, particularly for supervised tasks like headline generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset, Chinese Minority Headline Generation (CMHG), which includes 100,000 entries for Tibetan, and 50,000 entries each for Uyghur and Mongolian, specifically curated for headline generation tasks. Additionally, we propose a high-quality test set annotated by native speakers, designed to serve as a benchmark for future research in this domain. We hope this dataset will become a valuable resource for advancing headline generation in Chinese minority languages and contribute to the development of related benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: unsupervised, hallucination detection, large language models, IRIS, factual correctness

Summary:
IRIS is a new unsupervised hallucination detection framework designed to identify hallucinated content produced by large language models without the need for labeled data. Unlike existing methods that rely on proxy signals unrelated to factual correctness, IRIS prompts the language model to verify the truthfulness of statements and utilizes the uncertainty of responses as soft pseudolabels for truthfulness. This approach leverages internal representations intrinsic to factual correctness, leading to improved performance compared to current unsupervised methods. IRIS is computationally efficient, requires minimal training data, and is suitable for real-time detection. The framework demonstrates consistent performance across datasets and scenarios, providing a reliable solution for identifying hallucinated content generated by language models.

Abstract: Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data. While unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating labor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals unrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes toward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability across datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS, an unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal representations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to carefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its contextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low cost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for real-time detection.

Summary: 
This study extensively analyzes multi-label intent classification using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. Three popular pre-trained LLMs - LLama2-7B-hf, Mistral-7B-v0.1, and Yi-6B - are evaluated in a few-shot setup with 20 prompt examples. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are assessed, along with inference time and VRAM requirements. Mistral-7B-v0.1 outperforms the other models in detecting intent classes, with a weighted F1 score of 0.50. However, a BERT-based supervised classifier shows superior performance compared to the best few-shot generative LLM. This study provides insights into enhancing the Natural Language Understanding aspect of task-oriented chatbots using small open-source LLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of multi-label intent classification using Large Language Models (LLMs) that are open-source, publicly available, and can be run in consumer hardware. We use the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, a benchmark in the dialogue system domain, to investigate the efficacy of three popular open-source pre-trained LLMs, namely LLama2-7B-hf, Mistral-7B-v0.1, and Yi-6B. We perform the classification task in a few-shot setup, giving 20 examples in the prompt with some instructions. Our approach focuses on the differences in performance of these models across several performance metrics by methodically assessing these models on multi-label intent classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of the instruction-based fine-tuning approach with supervised learning using the smaller transformer model BertForSequenceClassification as a baseline. To evaluate the performance of the models, we use evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall as well as micro, macro, and weighted F1 score. We also report the inference time, VRAM requirements, etc. The Mistral-7B-v0.1 outperforms two other generative models on 11 intent classes out of 14 in terms of F-Score, with a weighted average of 0.50. It also has relatively lower Humming Loss and higher Jaccard Similarity, making it the winning model in the few-shot setting. We find BERT based supervised classifier having superior performance compared to the best performing few-shot generative LLM. The study provides a framework for small open-source LLMs in detecting complex multi-intent dialogues, enhancing the Natural Language Understanding aspect of task-oriented chatbots.

Summary: 
This study introduces a method to determine the timing of users' diagnoses of bipolar disorder by analyzing language on social media platforms. The research tracks language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis, compared to users with unipolar depression and non-affected users. The findings reveal pervasive linguistic alterations linked to mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought following BD diagnosis. Additionally, recurring mood-related language changes are observed over two decades post-diagnosis, displaying a 12-month periodicity indicative of seasonal mood episodes. Trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in female users. These results showcase language alterations in both acute and chronic phases of bipolar disorder, providing valuable insights for scalable monitoring of mental health using social media data.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.

Abstract: We present MSAs winning system for the BAREC 2025 Shared Task on fine-grained Arabic readability assessment, achieving first place in six of six tracks. Our approach is a confidence-weighted ensemble of four complementary transformer models (AraBERTv2, AraELECTRA, MARBERT, and CAMeLBERT) each fine-tuned with distinct loss functions to capture diverse readability signals. To tackle severe class imbalance and data scarcity, we applied weighted training, advanced preprocessing, SAMER corpus relabeling with our strongest model, and synthetic data generation via Gemini 2.5 Flash, adding about 10,000 rare-level samples. A targeted post-processing step corrected prediction distribution skew, delivering a 6.3 percent Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) gain. Our system reached 87.5 percent QWK at the sentence level and 87.4 percent at the document level, demonstrating the power of model and loss diversity, confidence-informed fusion, and intelligent augmentation for robust Arabic readability prediction.

Established psychometric questionnaires like the BFI and PVQ have been utilized to measure personality traits and values in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, applying these questionnaires to LLMs raises concerns about their lack of ecological validity. A comparative analysis of established and ecologically valid questionnaires was conducted, revealing significant differences in the profiles generated by each. Established questionnaires produced profiles that differed from those reflecting the psychological characteristics expressed in user queries, lacked sufficient items for stable measurement, created misleading impressions of stable constructs in LLMs, and exaggerated profiles for persona-prompted LLMs. This study cautions against using established psychological questionnaires for LLMs, highlighting the importance of considering ecological validity when assessing personality traits and values in these models. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Researchers have applied established psychometric questionnaires (e.g., BFI, PVQ) to measure the personality traits and values reflected in the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, concerns have been raised about applying these human-designed questionnaires to LLMs. One such concern is their lack of ecological validity--the extent to which survey questions adequately reflect and resemble real-world contexts in which LLMs generate texts in response to user queries. However, it remains unclear how established questionnaires and ecologically valid questionnaires differ in their outcomes, and what insights these differences may provide. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals that established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of LLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological characteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from insufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions that LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for persona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of established psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released upon publication.

Summary: 
Climate science literature is growing in complexity and volume, making it challenging for researchers to access relevant information. A domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) has been developed from climate publications and scientific texts to enhance access to climate knowledge. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, the KG allows for structured, semantic queries that enable researchers to discover specific connections, such as models validated in particular regions or commonly used datasets for specific patterns. The KG can answer such questions using Cypher queries and is integrated with large language models in RAG systems for improved transparency and reliability in climate-related question answering. This work not only focuses on constructing the KG but also demonstrates its practical value for climate researchers, model developers, and others who rely on accurate and contextual scientific information. <div>

Abstract: The growing complexity and volume of climate science literature make it increasingly difficult for researchers to find relevant information across models, datasets, regions, and variables. This paper introduces a domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) built from climate publications and broader scientific texts, aimed at improving how climate knowledge is accessed and used. Unlike keyword based search, our KG supports structured, semantic queries that help researchers discover precise connections such as which models have been validated in specific regions or which datasets are commonly used with certain teleconnection patterns. We demonstrate how the KG answers such questions using Cypher queries, and outline its integration with large language models in RAG systems to improve transparency and reliability in climate-related question answering. This work moves beyond KG construction to show its real world value for climate researchers, model developers, and others who rely on accurate, contextual scientific information.

Abstract: Efficient hospital management systems (HMS) are critical worldwide to address challenges such as overcrowding, limited resources, and poor availability of urgent health care. Existing methods often lack the ability to provide accurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and underrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical text generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing accurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans based on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a unique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical conversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient complaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed to account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art generative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2 Medium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text. Results from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model outperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and F1-scores of 68.5\%, 69.08\%, and 68.5\%, respectively. Comparative benchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to produce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare challenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments.

The development of medical chatbots in Arabic faces challenges due to limited annotated datasets. This study introduced a synthetic data augmentation approach to expand the training corpus for Arabic medical chatbots. Using advanced generative AI systems, 80,000 contextually relevant question-answer pairs were generated and integrated into the training pipeline. The performance of five language models was evaluated, with ChatGPT-4o data consistently showing higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations. The results highlight the effectiveness of synthetic augmentation in enhancing domain-specific language models for Arabic healthcare chatbot systems, showcasing potential for more inclusive, scalable, and accurate solutions in low-resource medical NLP.

Abstract: The development of medical chatbots in Arabic is significantly constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. While prior efforts compiled a dataset of 20,000 Arabic patient-doctor interactions from social media to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), model scalability and generalization remained limited. In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic data augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records. Using advanced generative AI systems ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro we generated 80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer pairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic samples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the training pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2, and evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven qualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic sources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and Gemini-generated data independently. The results showed that ChatGPT-4o data consistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all models. Overall, our findings demonstrate the viability of synthetic augmentation as a practical solution for enhancing domain-specific language models in-low resource medical NLP, paving the way for more inclusive, scalable, and accurate Arabic healthcare chatbot systems.

This paper explores the integration of prominence detection in automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational Austrian German. By fine-tuning wav2vec2 models, prominence detectors were developed to classify word-level prominence, resulting in an 85.53% accuracy in detecting prominence in correctly transcribed utterances. The annotated prominence information was used to train prominence-aware ASR systems that transcribe words along with their prominence levels.

Abstract: This paper investigates prominence-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR) by combining prominence detection and speech recognition for conversational Austrian German. First, prominence detectors were developed by fine-tuning wav2vec2 models to classify word-level prominence. The detector was then used to automatically annotate prosodic prominence in a large corpus. Based on those annotations, we trained novel prominence-aware ASR systems that simultaneously transcribe words and their prominence levels. The integration of prominence information did not change performance compared to our baseline ASR system, while reaching a prominence detection accuracy of 85.53% for utterances where the recognized word sequence was correct. This paper shows that transformer-based models can effectively encode prosodic information and represents a novel contribution to prosody-enhanced ASR, with potential applications for linguistic research and prosody-informed dialogue systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation. Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate, flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy applications.

Summary:
DocExplainerV0 is introduced as a bounding-box prediction module for Vision-Language Models, focusing on improving answer localization in complex documents. By decoupling answer generation from spatial localization, it aims to enhance interpretability and applicability without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. The module highlights the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that correct answers often lack reliable localization. Through systematic evaluation, it establishes a benchmark for future research in developing more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document understanding, particularly in identifying and extracting textual information from complex documents. Despite this, accurately localizing answers within documents remains a major challenge, limiting both interpretability and real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce \textit{DocExplainerV0}, a plug-and-play bounding-box prediction module that decouples answer generation from spatial localization. This design makes it applicable to existing VLMs, including proprietary systems where fine-tuning is not feasible. Through systematic evaluation, we provide quantitative insights into the gap between textual accuracy and spatial grounding, showing that correct answers often lack reliable localization. Our standardized framework highlights these shortcomings and establishes a benchmark for future research toward more interpretable and robust document information extraction VLMs.

This study examines register variation in texts written by humans versus large language models (LLMs) using Biber's multidimensional analysis. A new LLM-generated corpus, AI-Brown, is utilized for comparison with human-written texts such as the BE-21 corpus representing contemporary British English. The research also explores register variation in Czech using the AI-Koditex corpus and a Czech multidimensional model, as non-English languages are less represented in LLM training data. Sixteen frontier models, including base and instruction-tuned models, are analyzed to create a benchmark for comparing and ranking models based on interpretable dimensions.

Abstract: This study investigates the register variation in texts written by humans and comparable texts produced by large language models (LLMs). Biber's multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used, which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16 frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and ranked in interpretable dimensions.

<div> incongruent positivity, emotional support, large language models, supportive dialogue, online conversations
Summary: 
The article explores the concept of incongruent positivity in emotionally supportive conversations, where well-intended positive responses can sometimes come across as dismissive or unrealistic. The study analyzes both human and large language model-generated responses in different emotional intensities, categorizing them into Mild and Severe levels. It finds that large language models tend to exhibit unrealistic positivity, especially in high-stakes contexts. To address this issue, the researchers fine-tune the models on datasets with varying emotional reactions and develop a multilabel classifier ensemble for detecting incongruent positivity types. The study emphasizes the importance of balancing positive affect with emotional acknowledgment in online supportive dialogue and suggests the need for context-aware conversation systems that align with affective expectations to preserve trust. <div>

Abstract: In emotionally supportive conversations, well-intended positivity can sometimes misfire, leading to responses that feel dismissive, minimizing, or unrealistically optimistic. We examine this phenomenon of incongruent positivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and LLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant dialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated additional responses using large language models for the same context. We categorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers relationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and anxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative analysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes contexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic positivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes contexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we finetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover, we developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and MentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types across two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the need to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead study the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional acknowledgment. This approach offers insights into aligning large language models with affective expectations in the online supportive dialogue, paving the way toward context-aware and trust preserving online conversation systems.

Summary: 
- Large language models like BERT and its derivatives have limitations in processing long input texts for predictions.
- Classification tasks dealing with laws and draft laws (bills) face challenges due to the length of the texts.
- Experiment results with XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for multiclass classification show no clear advantage for Longformer.
- Comparison between GPT variants and the best-performing open model favored the latter.
- Analysis suggests the importance of support and substance overlaps between specific policy categories for performance on long text inputs. <br>  <div>

Abstract: The most widely used large language models in the social sciences (such as BERT, and its derivatives, e.g. RoBERTa) have a limitation on the input text length that they can process to produce predictions. This is a particularly pressing issue for some classification tasks, where the aim is to handle long input texts. One such area deals with laws and draft laws (bills), which can have a length of multiple hundred pages and, therefore, are not particularly amenable for processing with models that can only handle e.g. 512 tokens. In this paper, we show results from experiments covering 5 languages with XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 models for the multiclass classification task of the Comparative Agendas Project, which has a codebook of 21 policy topic labels from education to health care. Results show no particular advantage for the Longformer model, pre-trained specifically for the purposes of handling long inputs. The comparison between the GPT variants and the best-performing open model yielded an edge for the latter. An analysis of class-level factors points to the importance of support and substance overlaps between specific categories when it comes to performance on long text inputs.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, knowledge conflict, self-improving framework, contrastive learning, contextual faithfulness <br>
Summary: 
The article addresses the issue of unfaithful responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks due to knowledge conflict. A novel framework, Self-Improving Faithfulness Aware Contrastive Tuning, is proposed to improve contextual faithfulness in LLMs. The framework utilizes a self-instruct mechanism to generate high-quality contrastive learning data automatically, reducing manual annotation costs. By applying contrastive learning, the model is trained to enhance faithful responses and distance itself from unfaithful ones in a representation space. Experimental results on evaluation benchmarks show that the proposed SI FACT model improves the Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2% compared to baseline methods, while reducing reliance on internal memory. The approach demonstrates effectiveness and data efficiency in enhancing the faithfulness of LLMs, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable and proactive language models.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models often generate unfaithful responses in knowledge intensive tasks due to knowledge conflict,that is,a preference for relying on internal parametric knowledge rather than the provided context.To address this issue,we propose a novel self improving framework,Self Improving Faithfulness Aware Contrastive Tuning.The framework uses a self instruct mechanism that allows the base LLM to automatically generate high quality,structured contrastive learning data,including anchor samples,semantically equivalent positive samples,and negative samples simulating unfaithful scenarios.This approach significantly reduces the cost of manual annotation.Subsequently,contrastive learning is applied to train the model,enabling it to pull faithful responses closer and push unfaithful responses farther apart in the representation space.Experiments on knowledge conflict evaluation benchmarks ECARE KRE and COSE KRE show that the SI FACT model based on Llama3 8B Instruct improves the Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2% over the best baseline method,while significantly reducing dependence on internal memory.The results indicate that SI FACT provides strong effectiveness and high data efficiency in enhancing the contextual faithfulness of LLMs,offering a practical pathway toward building more proactive and trustworthy language models.

Summary: 
The article introduces DERN, a framework for expert pruning and reconstruction in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures used in large language models (LLMs). DERN aims to reduce memory usage and challenges in deployment by efficiently pruning redundant experts and recomposing neuron-level expert segments. By analyzing router statistics and addressing semantic conflicts at the neuron level, DERN successfully optimizes expert sparsity and improves performance on various benchmarks without additional training. The experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE models demonstrate DERN's effectiveness in enhancing commonsense reasoning and reducing memory usage, making SMoE LLMs more practical for deployment. <div>
arXiv:2509.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are widely used in large language models (LLMs) due to their computational efficiency. However, though only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts, Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage, making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.

The article discusses in-context learning (ICL) in autoregressive models, highlighting that while ICL involves deduction, it does not always explicitly encode observations. The study conducts a comprehensive analysis of ICL, considering factors such as memorization, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style. Results show that ICL is effective for learning but has limitations in generalizing to unseen tasks. The accuracy of tasks is dependent on the number of exemplars provided and the regularities in the prompt rather than model or prompt style. The study concludes that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding may not offer robust generalizability across tasks, hinting at limited all-purpose applicability. Overall, the research suggests that while ICL constitutes learning mathematically, it may not guarantee broad generalization capabilities. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.

Summary: <br>
Transformer-based language models face challenges in processing long essays beyond their fixed maximum length, especially in Automated Essay Scoring tasks. Truncating input text to fit into these models can compromise the evaluation of organizational elements in scoring rubrics that require assessment over long contexts. To address this issue, this study examines modified transformer architectures like XLNet, Longformer, ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models on the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset. The research evaluates the models' effectiveness in overcoming length limitations and preserving the quality of essay evaluations. By comparing the performance of these modified models, the study aims to provide insights into enhancing the capabilities of language models for scoring lengthy texts accurately and comprehensively. <br> <div>
arXiv:2509.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models are architecturally constrained to process text of a fixed maximum length. Essays written by higher-grade students frequently exceed the maximum allowed length for many popular open-source models. A common approach to addressing this issue when using these models for Automated Essay Scoring is to truncate the input text. This raises serious validity concerns as it undermines the model's ability to fully capture and evaluate organizational elements of the scoring rubric, which requires long contexts to assess. In this study, we evaluate several models that incorporate architectural modifications of the standard transformer architecture to overcome these length limitations using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset. The models considered in this study include fine-tuned versions of XLNet, Longformer, ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models.

Abstract: To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that enables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings, we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.

Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.

Abstract: Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance. In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical, necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised, text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain datasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by 12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines in 27 of 32 scenarios.

<title>Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL</title>

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces text-2-SQL-4-PM, a bilingual (Portuguese-English) benchmark dataset designed for the text-to-SQL task in the process mining domain. Text-to-SQL conversion facilitates natural language querying of databases, increasing accessibility for users without SQL expertise and productivity for those that are experts. The text-2-SQL-4-PM dataset is customized to address the unique challenges of process mining, including specialized vocabularies and single-table relational structures derived from event logs. The dataset comprises 1,655 natural language utterances, including human-generated paraphrases, 205 SQL statements, and ten qualifiers. Methods include manual curation by experts, professional translations, and a detailed annotation process to enable nuanced analyses of task complexity. Additionally, a baseline study using GPT-3.5 Turbo demonstrates the feasibility and utility of the dataset for text-to-SQL applications. The results show that text-2-SQL-4-PM supports evaluation of text-to-SQL implementations, offering broader applicability for semantic parsing and other natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: As the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory concludes 25 years of operation, preserving not only its vast data holdings ($\sim$1 ExaByte) but also the embedded scientific knowledge becomes a critical priority. The RHIC Data and Analysis Preservation Plan (DAPP) introduces an AI-powered assistant system that provides natural language access to documentation, workflows, and software, with the aim of supporting reproducibility, education, and future discovery. Built upon Large Language Models using Retrieval-Augmented Generation and the Model Context Protocol, this assistant indexes structured and unstructured content from RHIC experiments and enables domain-adapted interaction. We report on the deployment, computational performance, ongoing multi-experiment integration, and architectural features designed for a sustainable and explainable long-term AI access. Our experience illustrates how modern AI/ML tools can transform the usability and discoverability of scientific legacy data.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in developing accurate recommendation models is simulating user behavior, mainly due to the complex and stochastic nature of user interactions. Towards this, one promising line of work has been the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating user behavior. However, aligning these general-purpose large pre-trained models with user preferences necessitates: (i) effectively and continously parsing large-scale tabular user-item interaction data, (ii) overcoming pre-training-induced inductive biases to accurately learn user specific knowledge, and (iii) achieving the former two at scale for millions of users. While most previous works have focused on complex methods to prompt an LLM or fine-tune it on tabular interaction datasets, our approach shifts the focus to extracting robust textual user representations using a frozen LLM and simulating cost-effective, resource-efficient user agents powered by fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs). Further, we showcase a method for training multiple low-rank adapters for groups of users or \textit{persona}, striking an optimal balance between scalability and performance of user behavior agents. Our experiments provide compelling empirical evidence of the efficacy of our methods, demonstrating that user agents developed using our approach have the potential to bridge the gap between offline metrics and real-world performance of recommender systems.

Abstract: This study evaluates the resilience of large language models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks, specifically focusing on Flan-T5, BERT, and RoBERTa-Base. Using systematically designed adversarial tests through TextFooler and BERTAttack, we found significant variations in model robustness. RoBERTa-Base and FlanT5 demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining accuracy even when subjected to sophisticated attacks, with attack success rates of 0%. In contrast. BERT-Base showed considerable vulnerability, with TextFooler achieving a 93.75% success rate in reducing model accuracy from 48% to just 3%. Our research reveals that while certain LLMs have developed effective defensive mechanisms, these safeguards often require substantial computational resources. This study contributes to the understanding of LLM security by identifying existing strengths and weaknesses in current safeguarding approaches and proposes practical recommendations for developing more efficient and effective defensive strategies.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) within metaheuristics opens a novel path for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. While most existing approaches leverage LLMs for code generation to create or refine specific heuristics, they often overlook the structural properties of individual problem instances. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates LLMs with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the NP-hard Longest Run Subsequence problem. Our approach extends the instance-driven heuristic bias paradigm by introducing a human-LLM collaborative process to co-design and implement a set of computationally efficient metrics. The LLM analyzes these instance-specific metrics to generate a tailored heuristic bias, which steers the BRKGA toward promising areas of the search space. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including rigorous statistical tests, convergence and behavioral analyses, and targeted ablation studies, comparing our method against a standard BRKGA baseline across 1,050 generated instances of varying complexity. Results show that our top-performing hybrid, BRKGA+Llama-4-Maverick, achieves statistically significant improvements over the baseline, particularly on the most complex instances. Our findings confirm that leveraging an LLM to produce an a priori, instance-driven heuristic bias is a valuable approach for enhancing metaheuristics in complex optimization domains.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have emerged as a unified paradigm for speech understanding and generation, enabling natural human machine interaction. However, while most progress has focused on semantic accuracy and instruction following, the ability of SLMs to adapt their speaking style based on spoken instructions has received limited attention. We introduce Voice Style Adaptation (VSA), a new task that examines whether SLMs can modify their speaking style, such as timbre, prosody, or persona following natural language spoken commands. To study this task, we present VStyle, a bilingual (Chinese & English) benchmark covering four categories of speech generation: acoustic attributes, natural language instruction, role play, and implicit empathy. We also introduce the Large Audio Language Model as a Judge (LALM as a Judge) framework, which progressively evaluates outputs along textual faithfulness, style adherence, and naturalness, ensuring reproducible and objective assessment. Experiments on commercial systems and open source SLMs demonstrate that current models face clear limitations in controllable style adaptation, highlighting both the novelty and challenge of this task. By releasing VStyle and its evaluation toolkit, we aim to provide the community with a foundation for advancing human centered spoken interaction. The dataset and code are publicly available at \href{https://junzhan2000.github.io/VStyle.github.io/}{project's homepage}.

Abstract: We present a novel ensemble framework that stabilizes LLM based text extraction from noisy historical documents. We transcribe multiple augmented variants of each image with Gemini 2.0 Flash and fuse these outputs with a custom Needleman Wunsch style aligner that yields both a consensus transcription and a confidence score. We present a new dataset of 622 Pennsylvania death records, and demonstrate our method improves transcription accuracy by 4 percentage points relative to a single shot baseline. We find that padding and blurring are the most useful for improving accuracy, while grid warp perturbations are best for separating high and low confidence cases. The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document collections and transcription models.

Abstract: Large-scale single-cell and Perturb-seq investigations routinely involve clustering cells and subsequently annotating each cluster with Gene-Ontology (GO) terms to elucidate the underlying biological programs. However, both stages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently subjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present HYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming cluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM functioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or perturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses, accompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every predicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine similarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal consistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same cluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness, low similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two quantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is maximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity. When applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary test, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit alignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette score, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary. These findings establish LLM agents as objective adjudicators of cluster resolution and functional annotation, thereby paving the way for fully automated, context-aware interpretation pipelines in single-cell multi-omics studies.

Abstract: This paper presents boldsea, Boldachev's semantic-event approach -- an architecture for modeling complex dynamic systems using executable ontologies -- semantic models that act as dynamic structures, directly controlling process execution. We demonstrate that integrating event semantics with a dataflow architecture addresses the limitations of traditional Business Process Management (BPM) systems and object-oriented semantic technologies. The paper presents the formal BSL (boldsea Semantic Language), including its BNF grammar, and outlines the boldsea-engine's architecture, which directly interprets semantic models as executable algorithms without compilation. It enables the modification of event models at runtime, ensures temporal transparency, and seamlessly merges data and business logic within a unified semantic framework.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful way to improve large language model (LLM) performance by generating multiple candidate responses and selecting among them. However, existing work on dynamic allocation for test-time compute typically considers only parallel generation methods such as best-of-N, overlooking incremental decoding methods like beam search, and has largely ignored latency, focusing only on token usage. We formulate inference-time scaling as a problem of dynamic compute allocation and method selection, where the system must decide which strategy to apply and how much compute to allocate on a per-query basis. Our framework explicitly incorporates both token cost and wall-clock latency, the latter being critical for user experience and particularly for agentic workflows where models must issue multiple queries efficiently. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms static strategies, achieving favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs while remaining practical for deployment.

Abstract: LLMs promise to assist humans -- not just by answering questions, but by offering useful guidance across a wide range of tasks. But how far does that assistance go? Can a large language model based agent actually help someone accomplish their goal as an active participant? We test this question by engaging an LLM in UNO, a turn-based card game, asking it not to win but instead help another player to do so. We built a tool that allows decoder-only LLMs to participate as agents within the RLCard game environment. These models receive full game-state information and respond using simple text prompts under two distinct prompting strategies. We evaluate models ranging from small (1B parameters) to large (70B parameters) and explore how model scale impacts performance. We find that while all models were able to successfully outperform a random baseline when playing UNO, few were able to significantly aid another player.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable conversational agents (CAs) to express distinctive personalities, raising new questions about how such designs shape user perceptions. This study investigates how personality expression levels and user-agent personality alignment influence perceptions in goal-oriented tasks. In a between-subjects experiment (N=150), participants completed travel planning with CAs exhibiting low, medium, or high expression across the Big Five traits, controlled via our novel Trait Modulation Keys framework. Results revealed an inverted-U relationship: medium expression produced the most positive evaluations across Intelligence, Enjoyment, Anthropomorphism, Intention to Adopt, Trust, and Likeability, significantly outperforming both extremes. Personality alignment further enhanced outcomes, with Extraversion and Emotional Stability emerging as the most influential traits. Cluster analysis identified three distinct compatibility profiles, with "Well-Aligned" users reporting substantially positive perceptions. These findings demonstrate that personality expression and strategic trait alignment constitute optimal design targets for CA personality, offering design implications as LLM-based CAs become increasingly prevalent.

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in obtaining accurate word-level timestamps from strong automatic speech recognizers, in particular Whisper. Existing approaches either require additional training or are simply not competitive. The evaluation in prior work is also relatively loose, typically using a tolerance of more than 200 ms. In this work, we discover attention heads in Whisper that capture accurate word alignments and are distinctively different from those that do not. Moreover, we find that using characters produces finer and more accurate alignments than using wordpieces. Based on these findings, we propose an unsupervised approach to extracting word alignments by filtering attention heads while teacher forcing Whisper with characters. Our approach not only does not require training but also produces word alignments that are more accurate than prior work under a stricter tolerance between 20 ms and 100 ms.

Abstract: Neural front-ends represent a promising approach to feature extraction for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems as they enable to learn specifically tailored features for different tasks. Yet, many of the existing techniques remain heavily influenced by classical methods. While this inductive bias may ease the system design, our work aims to develop a more generic front-end for feature extraction. Furthermore, we seek to unify the front-end architecture contrasting with existing approaches that apply a composition of several layer topologies originating from different sources. The experiments systematically show how to reduce the influence of existing techniques to achieve a generic front-end. The resulting 2D convolutional front-end is parameter-efficient and suitable for a scenario with limited computational resources unlike large models pre-trained on unlabeled audio. The results demonstrate that this generic unified approach is not only feasible but also matches the performance of existing supervised learnable feature extractors.

Abstract: We introduce VARCO-VISION-2.0, an open-weight bilingual vision-language model (VLM) for Korean and English with improved capabilities compared to the previous model VARCO-VISION-14B. The model supports multi-image understanding for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location. Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these models advance the development of bilingual VLMs and their practical applications. Two variants of VARCO-VISION-2.0 are available at Hugging Face: a full-scale 14B model and a lightweight 1.7B model.

Abstract: Meeting transcription is a field of high relevance and remarkable progress in recent years. Still, challenges remain that limit its performance. In this work, we extend a previously proposed framework for analyzing leakage in speech separation with proper sensitivity to temporal locality. We show that there is significant leakage to the cross channel in areas where only the primary speaker is active. At the same time, the results demonstrate that this does not affect the final performance much as these leaked parts are largely ignored by the voice activity detection (VAD). Furthermore, different segmentations are compared showing that advanced diarization approaches are able to reduce the gap to oracle segmentation by a third compared to a simple energy-based VAD. We additionally reveal what factors contribute to the remaining difference. The results represent state-of-the-art performance on LibriCSS among systems that train the recognition module on LibriSpeech data only.

Abstract: Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&amp;When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.

<title>Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models</title>

Abstract: We prove a new asymptotic un-equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a ``typical set'' that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We refine the concept of ''typical set'' to include only grammatically correct texts. We then show that this refined typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct texts for a very general definition of grammar. This means that language models are strongly constrained in the range of their possible behaviors and outputs. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations. We discuss possible applications of the typical set concept to problems such as detecting synthetic texts and membership inference in training datasets.

Abstract: Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.

Abstract: Auto-evaluation is crucial for assessing response quality and offering feedback for model development. Recent studies have explored training large language models (LLMs) as generative judges to evaluate and critique other models' outputs. In this work, we investigate the idea of learning from both positive and negative data with preference optimization to enhance the evaluation capabilities of LLM judges across an array of different use cases. We achieve this by employing three approaches to collect the preference pairs for different use cases, each aimed at improving our generative judge from a different perspective. Our comprehensive study over a wide range of benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our generative judge achieves the best performance on 10 out of 13 benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-4o and specialized judge models. Further analysis show that our judge model robustly counters inherent biases such as position and length bias, flexibly adapts to any evaluation protocol specified by practitioners, and provides helpful language feedback for improving downstream generator models.

Abstract: Attributed Question Answering (AQA) aims to provide both a trustworthy answer and a reliable attribution report for a given question. Retrieval is a widely adopted approach, including two general paradigms: Retrieval-Then-Read (RTR) and post-hoc retrieval. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency, prompting growing interest in AQA among researchers. However, RTR-based AQA often suffers from irrelevant knowledge and rapidly changing information, even when LLMs are adopted, while post-hoc retrieval-based AQA struggles with comprehending long-form answers with complex logic, and precisely identifying the content needing revision and preserving the original intent. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an Atomic fact decomposition-based Retrieval and Editing (ARE) framework, which decomposes the generated long-form answers into molecular clauses and atomic facts by the instruction-tuned LLMs. Notably, the instruction-tuned LLMs are fine-tuned using a well-constructed dataset, generated from large scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This process involves extracting one-hop neighbors from a given set of entities and transforming the result into coherent long-form text. Subsequently, ARE leverages a search engine to retrieve evidences related to atomic facts, inputting these evidences into an LLM-based verifier to determine whether the facts require expansion for re-retrieval or editing. Furthermore, the edited facts are backtracked into the original answer, with evidence aggregated based on the relationship between molecular clauses and atomic facts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, with an additionally proposed new metric $Attr_{p}$ for evaluating the precision of evidence attribution.

Abstract: NLP benchmarks rely on standardized datasets for training and evaluating models and are crucial for advancing the field. Traditionally, expert annotations ensure high-quality labels; however, the cost of expert annotation does not scale well with the growing demand for larger datasets required by modern models. While crowd-sourcing provides a more scalable solution, it often comes at the expense of annotation precision and consistency. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance the annotation process, particularly for detecting label errors in existing datasets. In this work, we consider the recent approach of LLM-as-a-judge, leveraging an ensemble of LLMs to flag potentially mislabeled examples. We conduct a case study on four factual consistency datasets from the TRUE benchmark, spanning diverse NLP tasks, and on SummEval, which uses Likert-scale ratings of summary quality across multiple dimensions. We empirically analyze the labeling quality of existing datasets and compare expert, crowd-sourced, and LLM-based annotations in terms of the agreement, label quality, and efficiency, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each annotation method. Our findings reveal a substantial number of label errors, which, when corrected, induce a significant upward shift in reported model performance. This suggests that many of the LLMs' so-called mistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures. Additionally, we discuss the implications of mislabeled data and propose methods to mitigate them in training to improve performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling specialized tasks, including medical problem-solving. However, most studies predominantly focus on English-language contexts. This study introduces a novel benchmark dataset based on Polish medical licensing and specialization exams (LEK, LDEK, PES) taken by medical doctor candidates and practicing doctors pursuing specialization. The dataset was web-scraped from publicly available resources provided by the Medical Examination Center and the Chief Medical Chamber. It comprises over 24,000 exam questions, including a subset of parallel Polish-English corpora, where the English portion was professionally translated by the examination center for foreign candidates. By creating a structured benchmark from these existing exam questions, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including general-purpose, domain-specific, and Polish-specific models, and compare their performance against human medical students. Our analysis reveals that while models like GPT-4o achieve near-human performance, significant challenges persist in cross-lingual translation and domain-specific understanding. These findings underscore disparities in model performance across languages and medical specialties, highlighting the limitations and ethical considerations of deploying LLMs in clinical practice.

Abstract: In this work, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of a two-stage pipeline to evaluate literary machine translation, in a fine-grained manner, from English to Korean. The results show that our framework provides fine-grained, interpretable metrics suited for literary translation and obtains a higher correlation with human judgment than traditional machine translation metrics. Nonetheless, it still fails to match inter-human agreement, especially in metrics like Korean Honorifics. We also observe that LLMs tend to favor translations generated by other LLMs, and we highlight the necessity of developing more sophisticated evaluation methods to ensure accurate and culturally sensitive machine translation of literary works.

Abstract: Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

Abstract: Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models. While these models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets, real-world applications demand domain-specific evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a specialized counterpart to MTEB designed for the financial domain. FinMTEB comprises 64 financial domain-specific embedding datasets across 7 tasks that cover diverse textual types in both Chinese and English, such as financial news articles, corporate annual reports, ESG reports, regulatory filings, and earnings call transcripts. We also develop a finance-adapted model, Fin-E5, using a persona-based data synthetic method to cover diverse financial embedding tasks for training. Through extensive evaluation of 15 embedding models, including Fin-E5, we show three key findings: (1) performance on general-purpose benchmarks shows limited correlation with financial domain tasks; (2) domain-adapted models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts; and (3) surprisingly, a simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach outperforms sophisticated dense embeddings in financial Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks, underscoring current limitations in dense embedding techniques. Our work establishes a robust evaluation framework for financial NLP applications and provides crucial insights for developing domain-specific embedding models.

Abstract: Generation capabilities and language coverage of multilingual large language models (mLLMs) are advancing rapidly. However, evaluation practices for generative abilities of mLLMs are still lacking comprehensiveness, scientific rigor, and consistent adoption across research labs, which undermines their potential to meaningfully guide mLLM development. We draw parallels with machine translation (MT) evaluation, a field that faced similar challenges and has, over decades, developed transparent reporting standards and reliable evaluations for multilingual generative models. Through targeted experiments across key stages of the generative evaluation pipeline, we demonstrate how best practices from MT evaluation can deepen the understanding of quality differences between models. Additionally, we identify essential components for robust meta-evaluation of mLLMs, ensuring the evaluation methods themselves are rigorously assessed. We distill these insights into a checklist of actionable recommendations for mLLM research and development.

Abstract: Recent works have revealed the great potential of speculative decoding in accelerating the autoregressive generation process of large language models. The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa, involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering, summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method achieves a mean acceptance length up to 2.39 and speed up generation by 2.23.

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models (VLMs) promise universal image-text retrieval, yet their social biases remain underexplored. We perform the first systematic audit of four public multilingual CLIP variants: M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, CAPIVARA-CLIP, and the debiased SigLIP-2, covering ten languages that differ in resource availability and morphological gender marking. Using balanced subsets of FairFace and the PATA stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the intuition that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender skew than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared encoder of NLLB-CLIP and SigLIP-2 transfers English gender stereotypes into gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this leakage. Although SigLIP-2 reduces agency and communion skews, it inherits -- and in caption-sparse contexts (e.g., Xhosa) amplifies -- the English anchor's crime associations. Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all bias types, yet gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable whenever cross-lingual weight sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics thus mask language-specific hot spots, underscoring the need for fine-grained, language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual VLM research.

Abstract: Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise, necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error. We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification (LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses, human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR for label correction. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/liahr.

Abstract: Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii) cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities, incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse communities in LLM development.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life. Whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on short pun-based jokes, we investigate whether the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular form. We compare models' joke explanation abilities from simple puns to complex topical humour that requires esoteric knowledge of real-world entities and events. To this end, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation. We find that none of the tested models (including reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most existing works on overly simple joke forms.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking "Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and 230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social applications.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling, and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models' tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

Abstract: Understanding how emotional expression in language relates to brain function is a challenge in computational neuroscience and affective computing. Traditional neuroimaging is costly and lab-bound, but abundant digital text offers new avenues for emotion-brain mapping. Prior work has largely examined neuroimaging-based emotion localization or computational text analysis separately, with little integration. We propose a computational framework that maps textual emotional content to anatomically defined brain regions without requiring neuroimaging. Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we generate high-dimensional semantic representations, apply dimensionality reduction and clustering to identify emotional groups, and map them to 18 brain regions linked to emotional processing. Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing conversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to compare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and iii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to assess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored via lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with high spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic engagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully differentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution but lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex). This cost-effective, scalable approach enables large-scale analysis of naturalistic language, distinguishes between clinical populations, and offers a brain-based benchmark for evaluating AI emotional expression.

<title>Can LLM Prompting Serve as a Proxy for Static Analysis in Vulnerability Detection</title>

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on safety-critical code tasks such as vulnerability detection. Typically, static analysis (SA) tools, like CodeQL, CodeGuru Security, etc., are used for vulnerability detection. SA relies on predefined, manually-crafted rules for flagging various vulnerabilities. Thus, effectiveness of SA in detecting vulnerabilities depends on human experts and is known to report high error rates. In this study we investigate whether LLM prompting can be an effective alternative to these static analyzers in the partial code setting. We propose prompting strategies that integrate natural language instructions of vulnerabilities with contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our findings demonstrate that security-aware prompting techniques can be effective alternatives to the laborious, hand-crafted rules of static analyzers, which often result in high false negative rates in the partial code setting. When leveraging SOTA reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1, each of our prompting strategies exceeds the static analyzer baseline, with the best strategies improving accuracy by as much as 31.6%, F1-scores by 71.7%, pairwise accuracies by 60.4%, and reducing FNR by as much as 37.6%.

Abstract: Soft prompt learning methods are effective for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Nevertheless, empirical evidence reveals a tendency of existing methods that they overfit seen classes and exhibit degraded performance on unseen classes. This limitation is due to the inherent bias in the training data towards the seen classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel soft prompt learning method, named Mixture-of-Prompts Distillation (MoPD), which can effectively transfer useful knowledge from hard prompts manually hand-crafted (a.k.a. teacher prompts) to the learnable soft prompt (a.k.a. student prompt), thereby enhancing the generalization ability of soft prompts on unseen classes. Moreover, the proposed MoPD method utilizes a gating network that learns to select hard prompts used for prompt distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoPD method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines especially on on unseen classes.

<title>Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are therefore understood as systems that perceive their environment and execute pre-programmed tasks independently of external input, consistent with the SAE levels of automated driving. Yet recent research and real-world deployments have begun to showcase vehicles that exhibit behaviors outside the scope of this definition. These include natural language interaction with humans, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and the handling of unforeseen ethical dilemmas, enabled in part by multimodal large language models (LLMs). These developments highlight not only a gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capacities required for human-centered mobility, but also the emergence of a form of vehicle intelligence that currently lacks a clear designation. To address this gap, the paper introduces the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs): vehicles that integrate agentic AI systems to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. It synthesizes recent advances in agentic systems and suggests how AgVs can complement and even reshape conventional autonomy to ensure mobility services are aligned with user and societal needs. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs and their potential role in shaping future agentic transportation systems.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input-Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we utilize meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also discover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query strategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better. We can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the queries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the size should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the result would be 90.0% on AIME24 and 80.0% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Summary:
In the study, the authors explore strategies for improving the quality of Language Model (LM) outputs in constrained settings such as the LM-KBC challenge. Three key aspects of the triple completion task are investigated: generation, quality assurance, and LLM response parsing. The research reveals that additional information can enhance the quality of triple generation and that LLMs are effective at filtering out poor quality triples. Additionally, the study highlights the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency when parsing LLM responses, which varies based on the specific setting. This work sheds light on the potential limitations and opportunities for utilizing advanced language models in constrained environments.

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

Summary:<br />
The LobbyMap Platform by InfluenceMap monitors the climate policy engagement of companies and industry associations, assessing their support for science-based policy pathways for the Paris Agreement. While the platform has automated some aspects of analysis, a significant portion remains manual, leading to time- and labor-intensive processes with potential for human error. A proposed AI-assisted framework utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data, showing promising results. By combining layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies, the system effectively extracts and classifies evidence from multilingual corporate documents. However, the detailed analysis still requires human judgment to ensure accuracy, emphasizing the need for a human-in-the-loop approach where technology complements expert assessment. <div>

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data. Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents. We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces, expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

Summary: 
This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings, the method transforms textual data into response data suitable for psychometric analysis. This approach treats documents as individuals and words as items, providing a natural psychometric interpretation. The process involves two stages: obtaining contextual scores through natural language processing techniques and transformer models, and performing psychometric analysis using various factor analysis techniques. The method was tested on the Wiki STEM corpus, demonstrating its potential to uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as education, psychology, and law.

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items, this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as education, psychology, and law.

Summary:
BRoverbs is a new dataset designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of Brazilian Portuguese. Existing evaluation frameworks for Portuguese LLMs are limited, often relying on translated datasets that do not capture the full linguistic nuances or cultural references of the language. Native Portuguese-language datasets mainly focus on structured exams or sentiment analysis, leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. BRoverbs aims to fill this gap by using Brazilian proverbs, which contain cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex syntactic structures that challenge the comprehension of LLMs. This dataset provides a new evaluation tool for Portuguese-language LLMs and contributes to advancing regionally informed benchmarking. The benchmark is accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.<br /><br />Summary: BRoverbs is a new dataset specifically designed for evaluating LLM performance in Brazilian Portuguese using proverbs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied. This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references. Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions, leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed benchmarking. The benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

Summary: 
Visual-Language Models (VLMs) excel in visual understanding and language-based reasoning but struggle with tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation, as demonstrated in visual equation solving. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they face challenges in visually grounded ones due to counting being the primary bottleneck. Even when variable recognition is accurate, composing recognition and reasoning introduces errors, underscoring multi-step visual reasoning challenges. As equation complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes limiting. These findings highlight weaknesses in current VLMs and suggest opportunities for enhancing visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors, highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor. These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

Summary: 
The study introduces and evaluates SPICE, a diagnostic signal obtained by asking a Large Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a user's behavior. Results show that SPICE effectively discriminates based on user tone, with friendly interactions receiving a high preference to continue, abusive interactions showing a preference to discontinue, and unclear interactions falling in between. SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse classification and remains reliable even when abuse is not identified. The study also found that the study context description impacts SPICE under ambiguity in certain conditions. Overall, SPICE serves as a practical tool for auditing model dispositions and offers a direct relational signal of a model's state, complementing existing metrics. <div>

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone (friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480 trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone. Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5% YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue (17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust, low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions, complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support replication.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse research domains. However, their performance in universal information extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant ~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages. We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy, heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and 71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3 adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3 delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1, GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages (Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and broad linguistic competence.

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&amp;B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized), incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets, fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

Summary: 
Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification faces challenges such as dataset biases and spurious correlations between text features and sentiment labels. To address these issues, a novel counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework is proposed in this paper. The framework incorporates counterfactual data augmentation to generate detail-matched image-text samples that guide the model's attention towards sentiment-related causal features. An adaptive debiasing contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to learn robust features from counterfactual data and mitigate the influence of biased words. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines on various benchmark datasets. <div>
arXiv:2509.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary: 
EchoX is a novel approach designed to improve the performance of speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs). These models, derived from text-based large language models, often suffer from limitations in knowledge and reasoning capabilities due to the acoustic-semantic gap in their feature representation space. EchoX addresses this issue by integrating both acoustic and semantic learning, resulting in strong reasoning abilities for SLLMs. By dynamically generating speech training targets based on semantic representations, EchoX achieves advanced performance on knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks with just six thousand hours of training data. The project is openly available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks.

<title>Efficient Trie-based Biasing using K-step Prediction for Rare Word Recognition</title>

<div> Keywords: ASR models, rare word recognition, contextual biasing, Trie-based biasing, Whisper

Summary:
Contextual biasing is a method to improve rare word recognition in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models by prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. One common approach is Trie-based biasing, which gives bonus scores to partial hypotheses that may lead to the generation of rare words. However, the revocation of these bonuses in beam search is computationally expensive for models with large decoders. To address this limitation, a new method is proposed to adapt ASR models to predict multiple steps at once, avoiding the need for revoking bonuses. By fine-tuning the Whisper model with only 10 hours of synthetic data, the proposed method significantly reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 30.86% to 12.19%. This innovative approach demonstrates the effectiveness of looking ahead in improving rare word recognition in ASR models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g. "Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 30.86% to 12.19%.

<div> keywords: Rare word recognition, ASR models, synthetic data, contextual biasing, Whisper <br />
Summary:<br />
Rare word recognition in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems can be enhanced by adapting models to synthetic data including these words and utilizing contextual biasing. This biasing module prioritizes rare words and improves their recognition accuracy. However, using synthetic rare word data can lead to overfitting due to artifacts in the audio. To combat this issue, a keyword-aware loss function has been introduced to focus on training biasing modules to recognize biased words more effectively. The loss function includes terms for predicting biased words and detecting biased word positions, aiding in the decoding of rare words during inference. By applying this approach to 10 hours of synthetic data with the Whisper model, a significant reduction in word error rate was achieved on the NSC Part 2 test set, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving rare word recognition accuracy. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to 11.81%.

Summary: 
Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication similar to human speech, offering insights into the neural basis of vocalization. A new Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM) pipeline was introduced to analyze their vocalizations. This optimized model outperformed basic human-speech-based baselines, producing vocalizations that closely matched real samples. GmSLM's unsupervised approach effectively distinguished real conversations from artificial ones and showed promise in supporting future research in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary biology. By linking vocalization with brain activity, GmSLM provides a practical framework for studying the intricate communication patterns of Marmoset monkeys. Access to samples and further information is available at pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking. Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data, alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new context compression framework, CCF, aimed at improving efficiency in long-context language modeling. CCF utilizes hierarchical latent representations to preserve global semantics while reducing input redundancy. By integrating segment-wise semantic aggregation and key-value memory encoding, CCF creates compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and long-range understanding. A training-efficient optimization strategy is also introduced, combining incremental segment decoding with sparse reservoir sampling to reduce memory overhead without compromising performance. Empirical results on multiple benchmarks show that CCF achieves competitive perplexity at high compression ratios, improving throughput and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. This suggests that structured compression can enhance scalability and effectiveness in long-context language modeling. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding, forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context language modeling.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability. This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem, using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology. Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1) internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation, co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic, cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Hallucination Detection, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, MetaRAG, Identity-aware AI

Summary: 
MetaRAG is a novel testing framework designed to detect hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It operates in real-time without the need for ground-truth references or access to model internals, making it suitable for high-stakes domains. MetaRAG decomposes answers into factoids, generates mutant variants using synonym and antonym substitutions, verifies variants against retrieved context, and aggregates penalties for inconsistencies to assign a hallucination score. It localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span level, allowing users to spot flagged spans and enabling system designers to set identity-sensitive query thresholds. Experiments on a proprietary dataset demonstrate MetaRAG's effectiveness in detecting hallucinations and ensuring the deployment of trustworthy RAG-based conversational agents. Additionally, MetaRAG offers a topic-based deployment design to implement identity-aware safeguards; however, this design is discussed but not evaluated in the experiments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

<div> Keywords: analogical reasoning, cognitive science, natural language processing, relational understanding, entity-level similarity
Summary: 
Analogical reasoning plays a crucial role in human cognition and has been a topic of interest in cognitive science. This paper explores the processes underlying analogical reasoning and their relevance to current research in natural language processing (NLP). While these processes align well with NLP concepts, they are often not viewed from a cognitive perspective. The paper highlights how understanding analogical reasoning can address various challenges in NLP research, emphasizing relational understanding over entity-level similarity. By incorporating cognitive science insights into NLP, researchers can enhance text comprehension and move beyond simplistic similarity measures. This shift towards relational understanding in NLP may lead to more nuanced and effective language processing models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

Hierarchical bracketing encodings in dependency graph parsing are revisited from a practical standpoint. This approach encodes graphs as sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with a reduced label space while still capturing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes.

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

<div> confidence elicitation, Large Language Models (LLMs), GrACE, calibration, real-time

Summary:<br />
The article introduces GrACE, a Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation, aimed at evaluating the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently and effectively. GrACE utilizes a unique mechanism where confidence is determined by the similarity between the last hidden state and a specific token in the model's vocabulary. By fine-tuning the model for calibration, GrACE achieves superior discriminative capacity and calibration compared to existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate GrACE's ability to enhance accuracy and reduce the number of samples required in test-time scaling. This indicates GrACE's potential as a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.09438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks, outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Summary:
- The study investigates Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) in job title matching, aiming to improve semantic alignment in resume recommendation systems.
- A self-supervised hybrid architecture is introduced, combining dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance both semantic alignment and explainability.
- The approach emphasizes data stratification by dividing the STR score continuum into low, medium, and high semantic relatedness regions for a detailed model performance analysis.

- The findings emphasize the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings and the significance of regional performance analysis for understanding model behavior in HR systems and applications requiring fairness, explainability, and contextual matching. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and contextual matching are essential.

The DeMeVa team's system paper discusses their strategies for the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025). They focus on in-context learning (ICL) with large language models and compare example sampling strategies. Their research indicates that ICL effectively predicts annotator-specific annotations, leading to competitive performance when aggregating these predictions into soft labels. Additionally, the team evaluates label distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa and finds that several fine-tuning methods show promise for soft label predictions. The paper highlights the potential of LDL methods for soft label predictions and suggests further exploration by the perspectivist community. <div>

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations (perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the perspectivist community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers (2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved - highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific progress in other domains.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the importance of social connection in online learning environments and the limitations faced in forming social groups. It introduces SAMI as a solution to facilitate student connections but points out its incomplete Theory of Mind, hindering its ability to understand student personalities. To address this, the paper proposes a personality detection model using GPTs to infer Big-Five traits from forum introduction posts. The model's effectiveness is benchmarked against existing models, showcasing its proficiency. Integrating this model into SAMI's matchmaking system enhances social recommendations by incorporating personality traits. Initial results indicate that personality traits can enhance existing matchmaking factors, although further evaluation is needed to assess their impact on student engagement and match quality. <div>

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations. To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full impact on student engagement and match quality.

- The EXPRESS benchmark dataset, curated from Reddit communities, features 251 fine-grained self-disclosed emotion labels for evaluating LLMs.
- Existing research on emotion recognition using LLMs often overlooks nuanced expressions and focuses on predefined categories.
- LLMs struggle to accurately predict emotions aligning with human self-disclosures, even under various prompt settings.
- Qualitative analysis shows that while some LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established theories, they may fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as human disclosures.

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research. While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories, enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories (Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches: GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles. Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5% (Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by 5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

Summary:<br /><br />MOAT is a framework designed to enhance the collaboration among specialized agents in multi-agent systems. It focuses on optimizing the planning agent to generate subgoals that guide the grounding agent effectively. By iteratively aligning the agents, MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training process. The grounding agent is fine-tuned using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by itself, enhancing its generalization capability. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that MOAT outperforms existing methods, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

Summary:
- The study explores the functioning of large language models (LLMs) in mental math tasks, focusing on the operations of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers.
- Through two techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), the researchers identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) in LLMs that is essential for high performance on math tasks.
- The AF1 subgraph demonstrates that meaningful computation occurs late in the model, primarily at the last token, with information transfer happening in specific middle layers.
- This subgraph is found to be necessary and sufficient for accurate model performance, transferring across different models and input styles.
- Ablations on CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other methods, providing insights into the inner workings of LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers. With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other methods, which may be of independent interest.

Summary:
- The framework SteerMoE helps steer Mixture-of-Experts models by identifying behavior-linked experts and controlling their activation.
- By selectively deactivating experts during inference, behaviors like faithfulness and safety can be controlled without retraining or weight modification.
- Across multiple benchmarks and Large Language Models (LLMs), SteerMoE improves safety by up to +20% and faithfulness by +27%.
- In adversarial attack mode, the safety drops by -41% when using SteerMoE alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods.
- This combination can bypass all safety guardrails, potentially exposing new risks related to alignment faking hidden within experts.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts. We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to +20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by -41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden within experts.

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Verifiable Rewards, Curiosity-Driven Exploration, Large Language Models, Exploration Bonus
Summary:<br /><br />Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful approach to enhance the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current RLVR methods often suffer from poor exploration, leading to premature convergence and entropy collapse. To address this issue, a new framework called Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE) is introduced, utilizing the model's intrinsic curiosity to guide exploration. By formalizing curiosity signals from both the actor and the critic, CDE incentivizes the model to explore diverse responses and avoid overconfident errors. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the benefits of the actor-wise and critic-wise bonuses in promoting exploration and diversity in the model's responses. Empirical results show a significant improvement over standard RLVR methods on AIME benchmarks. Additionally, insights into the calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR highlight common failure modes in Large Language Models. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL. Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM failure modes.

Summary: <br />
This article explores the implementation of vibe coding, using natural language to create AI software applications for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education. The study developed a human-AI meta-languaging framework with three dimensions: talking to AI, talking through AI, and talking about AI. Through a workshop using backward design principles, students designed applications to address EFL writing challenges. The analysis of contrasting cases revealed differences in students' prompt engineering approaches, leading to variations in vibe coding outcomes. The findings suggest that effective vibe coding instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, structured prompt engineering teaching, critical authorship discussions, and vocabulary development for articulating AI mental models. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding how students interact with AI in the vibe coding process and the need for clear communication and meta-languaging strategies. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding (using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges. We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images. Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.

Summary: 
ReT-2 is a unified retrieval model designed to support multimodal queries, combining images and text, and search across multimodal document collections. It utilizes multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to integrate information across layers and modalities effectively. The model successfully captures fine-grained visual and textual details. ReT-2 outperforms existing methods in various retrieval configurations, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage. Integration of ReT-2 into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines also leads to improved downstream performance on datasets like Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek. Overall, ReT-2 is a promising approach for complex retrieval tasks in multimodal environments. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged. Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets.

In response to these findings, the article proposes a strategic Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) agenda. It advises practitioners to optimize content for machine scannability, prioritize earned media for AI-perceived authority, use engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and address the "big brand bias" for niche players.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2) dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent "big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the new generative search landscape.

Summary:
COCO-Urdu is introduced as a large-scale image-caption dataset for Urdu language, containing 59,000 images and 319,000 captions. The dataset aims to address the lack of resources for Urdu in multimodal research, and reduce language bias in vision-language models. Captions were translated and validated using a quality estimation framework integrating various metrics such as COMET-Kiwi, CLIP-based similarity, and BERTScore. The dataset was benchmarked on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, demonstrating strong performance. COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset, providing a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems. The release of both the dataset and quality estimation pipeline is significant for advancing research in multilingual vision-language models. 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale, high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000 images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency; low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel evaluation framework, bona fide cross-testing, for assessing audio deepfake detection models. Traditional evaluation methods, which use a single Equal Error Rate (EER) and combine multiple synthesizers in datasets, can lead to biased results due to unequal sample representation. Additionally, most existing datasets lack diversity in bona fide speech, limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions. The proposed framework addresses these challenges by incorporating diverse bona fide datasets and aggregating EERs for more balanced assessments. By benchmarking over 150 synthesizers across nine speech types and releasing a new dataset, the study aims to enhance the robustness and interpretability of ADD model evaluations. The framework improves reliability by providing a more comprehensive and realistic testing environment for evaluating the performance of audio deepfake detection models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) models are commonly evaluated using datasets that combine multiple synthesizers, with performance reported as a single Equal Error Rate (EER). However, this approach disproportionately weights synthesizers with more samples, underrepresenting others and reducing the overall reliability of EER. Additionally, most ADD datasets lack diversity in bona fide speech, often featuring a single environment and speech style (e.g., clean read speech), limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we propose bona fide cross-testing, a novel evaluation framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and aggregates EERs for more balanced assessments. Our approach improves robustness and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods. We benchmark over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types and release a new dataset to facilitate further research at https://github.com/cyaaronk/audio_deepfake_eval.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism, there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases: identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in 70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the 80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Long-horizon tasks, Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients, Sparse rewards, Learning dynamics

Summary:
The paper discusses the challenges faced by agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-horizon tasks due to sparse rewards. Traditional methods focus on dense reward signals or step-wise feedback. The authors propose the Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG) framework to address the issue of inefficient updates and potential destabilization during learning. EMPG recalibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and task outcome, amplifying updates for confident correct actions, penalizing errors, and attenuating updates for uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. Additionally, a bonus term incentivizes agents to find more predictable solution paths. Experimental results on challenging tasks such as WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search demonstrate that EMPG outperforms strong policy gradient baselines, leading to significant performance gains. The framework shows promise in improving learning dynamics and efficiency in long-horizon tasks for LLM-based agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.09265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

Summary:
Recent research has highlighted the efficacy of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in generating high-quality trajectories in math and symbolic domains using large language models (LLMs). This study explores repurposing MCTS-derived trajectories to enhance policy optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning, particularly focusing on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. The proposed staged GRPO training paradigm leverages partially revealed MCTS rollouts to generate completions, introducing a tree-structured setting for advantage estimation. This approach offers a diverse range of prefix-conditioned reward signals, leading to enhanced compositional reasoning quality. However, challenges such as advantage saturation and reward signal collapse arise, prompting the development of heuristic and statistical solutions. The study underscores the importance of structured advantage estimation in stabilizing updates and improving policy learning in complex reward structures. Open research challenges in learning under staged or tree-like reward settings are also discussed.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

It evaluates state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on MatCha and identifies a performance gap compared to human experts, especially in tasks requiring higher-level expertise and visual perception. The study shows that existing MLLMs struggle to adapt to real-world materials characterization challenges, even with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information, revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising 1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MatCha.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

<title>LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations</title>

<div> Keywords: Language models, self-generated counterfactual explanations, validity-minimality trade-off, decision-making behavior, explainability

Summary: 
Language models need to be able to explain their decisions in natural language to collaborate effectively with humans. This study focuses on self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input to achieve a different outcome. The research evaluates whether Language Models (LLMs) can generate valid and minimal SCEs. Results show that while LLMs can produce valid SCEs, they often fail to generate minimal explanations, offering limited insight into their decision-making process. Additionally, when asked to produce minimal counterfactuals, LLMs make edits that are too small to change predictions, indicating a validity-minimality trade-off. These findings suggest that SCEs may not be an effective tool for model explainability and could potentially mislead users. It is crucial to consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations when deploying LLMs in high-stakes scenarios. <div>

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at https://github.com/HarryMayne/SCEs.

<title>DiFlow-TTS: Discrete Flow Matching with Factorized Speech Tokens for Low-Latency Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample, requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness, prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to 25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge, the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.

<title>SimpleVLA-RL: Scaling VLA Training via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

<title>ButterflyQuant: Ultra-low-bit LLM Quantization through Learnable Orthogonal Butterfly Transforms</title>

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark). FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page: https://flux-reason-6m.github.io/ .

Abstract: Existing LLM red-teaming approaches prioritize high attack success rate, often resulting in high-perplexity prompts. This focus overlooks low-perplexity attacks that are more difficult to filter, more likely to arise during benign usage, and more impactful as negative downstream training examples. In response, we introduce ASTPrompter, a single-step optimization method that uses contrastive preference learning to train an attacker to maintain low perplexity while achieving a high attack success rate (ASR). ASTPrompter achieves an attack success rate 5.1 times higher on Llama-8.1B while using inputs that are 2.1 times more likely to occur according to the frozen LLM. Furthermore, our attack transfers to Mistral-7B, Qwen-7B, and TinyLlama in both black- and white-box settings. Lastly, by tuning a single hyperparameter in our method, we discover successful attack prefixes along an efficient frontier between ASR and perplexity, highlighting perplexity as a previously under-considered factor in red-teaming.

<title>RED: Unleashing Token-Level Rewards from Holistic Feedback via Reward Redistribution</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) offers a promising approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Typically, a reward model is trained or supplied to act as a proxy for humans in evaluating generated responses during the reinforcement training phase. However, current reward models operate as sequence-to-one models, allocating a single, sparse, and delayed reward to an entire output sequence. This approach may overlook the significant contributions of individual tokens toward the desired outcome. To this end, we propose a more fine-grained, token-level guidance approach for RL training. Specifically, we introduce RED, a novel reward redistribition method that evaluates and assigns specific credit to each token using an off-the-shelf reward model. Utilizing these fine-grained rewards enhances the model's understanding of language nuances, leading to more precise performance improvements. Notably, our method does not require modifying the reward model or introducing additional training steps, thereby incurring minimal computational costs. Experimental results across diverse datasets and tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Abstract: This technical report describes the MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder, a foundation model designed to support a wide range of downstream speech applications. Developed as part of Singapore's National Multimodal Large Language Model Programme, the MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder is tailored to address the speech processing needs in Singapore and the surrounding Southeast Asian region. The model currently supports mainly English, including the variety spoken in Singapore. We are actively expanding our datasets to gradually cover other languages in subsequent releases. The MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder was pre-trained from scratch on 200,000 hours of unlabelled speech data using a self-supervised learning approach based on masked language modelling. We describe our training procedure and hyperparameter tuning experiments in detail below. Our evaluation demonstrates improvements to spontaneous and Singapore speech benchmarks for speech recognition, while remaining competitive to other state-of-the-art speech encoders across ten other speech tasks. We commit to releasing our model, supporting broader research endeavours, both in Singapore and beyond.

Abstract: Complex problem-solving requires cognitive flexibility--the capacity to entertain multiple perspectives while preserving their distinctiveness. This flexibility replicates the "wisdom of crowds" within a single individual, allowing them to "think with many minds." While mental simulation enables imagined deliberation, cognitive constraints limit its effectiveness. We propose synthetic deliberation, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based method that simulates discourse between agents embodying diverse perspectives, as a solution. Using a custom GPT-based model, we showcase its benefits: concurrent processing of multiple viewpoints without cognitive degradation, parallel exploration of perspectives, and precise control over viewpoint synthesis. By externalizing the deliberative process and distributing cognitive labor between parallel search and integration, synthetic deliberation transcends mental simulation's limitations. This approach shows promise for strategic planning, policymaking, and conflict resolution.

Abstract: Users often assume that large language models (LLMs) share their cognitive alignment of context and intent, leading them to omit critical information in question-answering (QA) and produce ambiguous queries. Responses based on misaligned assumptions may be perceived as hallucinations. Therefore, identifying possible implicit assumptions is crucial in QA. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose Conditional Ambiguous Question-Answering (CondAmbigQA), a benchmark comprising 2,000 ambiguous queries and condition-aware evaluation metrics. Our study pioneers "conditions" as explicit contextual constraints that resolve ambiguities in QA tasks through retrieval-based annotation, where retrieved Wikipedia fragments help identify possible interpretations for a given query and annotate answers accordingly. Experiments demonstrate that models considering conditions before answering improve answer accuracy by 11.75%, with an additional 7.15% gain when conditions are explicitly provided. These results highlight that apparent hallucinations may stem from inherent query ambiguity rather than model failure, and demonstrate the effectiveness of condition reasoning in QA, providing researchers with tools for rigorous evaluation.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) necessitates reliable methods to detect LLM-generated text.

Experimental results demonstrate that SimMark sets a new benchmark for robust watermarking of LLM-generated content, surpassing prior sentence-level watermarking techniques in robustness, sampling efficiency, and applicability across diverse domains, all while maintaining the text quality and fluency.

<title>Are Generative Models Underconfident? Better Quality Estimation with Boosted Model Probability</title>

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) is estimating quality of the model output during inference when the ground truth is not available. Deriving output quality from the models' output probability is the most trivial and low-effort way. However, we show that the output probability of text-generation models can appear underconfident. At each output step, there can be multiple correct options, making the probability distribution spread out more. Thus, lower probability does not necessarily mean lower output quality. Due to this observation, we propose a QE approach called BoostedProb, which boosts the model's confidence in cases where there are multiple viable output options. With no increase in complexity, BoostedProb is notably better than raw model probability in different settings, achieving on average +0.194 improvement in Pearson correlation to ground-truth quality. It also comes close to or outperforms more costly approaches like supervised or ensemble-based QE in certain settings.

Abstract: Culturally grounded commonsense reasoning is underexplored in low-resource languages due to scarce data and costly native annotation. We test whether large language models (LLMs) can generate culturally nuanced narratives for such settings. Focusing on Javanese and Sundanese, we compare three data creation strategies: (1) LLM-assisted stories prompted with cultural cues, (2) machine translation from Indonesian benchmarks, and (3) native-written stories. Human evaluation finds LLM stories match natives on cultural fidelity but lag in coherence and correctness. We fine-tune models on each dataset and evaluate on a human-authored test set for classification and generation. LLM-generated data yields higher downstream performance than machine-translated and Indonesian human-authored training data. We release a high-quality benchmark of culturally grounded commonsense stories in Javanese and Sundanese to support future work.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented Question Answering (QA) helps QA models overcome knowledge gaps by incorporating retrieved evidence, typically a set of passages, alongside the question at test time. Previous studies show that this approach improves QA performance and reduces hallucinations, without, however, assessing whether the retrieved passages are indeed useful at answering correctly. In this work, we propose to quantify the uncertainty of a QA model via estimating the utility of the passages it is provided with. We train a lightweight neural model to predict passage utility for a target QA model and show that while simple information theoretic metrics can predict answer correctness up to a certain extent, our approach efficiently approximates or outperforms more expensive sampling-based methods.

Abstract: Language model heavily depends on high-quality data for optimal performance. Existing approaches rely on manually designed heuristics, the perplexity of existing models, training classifiers, or careful prompt engineering, which require significant expert experience and human annotation effort while introduce biases. We introduce CritiQ, a novel data selection method that automatically mines criteria from human preferences for data quality with only ~30 human-annotated pairs and performs efficient data selection. The main component, CritiQ Flow, employs a manager agent to evolve quality criteria and worker agents to make pairwise judgments. We build a knowledge base that extracts quality criteria from previous work to boost CritiQ Flow. Compared to perplexity- and classifier- based methods, verbal criteria are more interpretable and possess reusable value. After deriving the criteria, we train the CritiQ Scorer to give quality scores and perform efficient data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the code, math, and logic domains, achieving high accuracy on human-annotated test sets. To validate the quality of the selected data, we continually train Llama 3.1 models and observe improved performance on downstream tasks compared to uniform sampling. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the knowledge base and the reflection process. We analyze how criteria evolve and the effectiveness of majority voting.

Abstract: Mental health issues are worsening in today's competitive society, such as depression and anxiety. Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs in psychological healing.

Abstract: Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for communication and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and action. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-task question answering, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Speaking with Intent over direct generation without explicit intent. Further analysis corroborates the generalizability of SWI under different experimental settings. Moreover, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. The promising results in enhancing LLMs with explicit intents pave a new avenue for boosting LLMs' generation and reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.

Abstract: Test-time compute methods like beam search can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities and problem-solving accuracy of large language models. However, these approaches require substantially increased computational resources, with most computation wasted on exploring low-diversity branches where the model already exhibits high confidence. We observe that a small subset of uncertain reasoning steps has a disproportionately large impact on final prediction accuracy, and branching at these points tends to yield higher-quality and more diverse candidate reasoning steps. Therefore, we introduce Entropy-Gated Branching: a novel inference technique that dynamically allocates computational resources by selectively expanding prediction sequences only at points of high uncertainty. Our method leverages entropy as a gating mechanism to identify when branching is most beneficial, coupled with an external feedback model to rank and prune candidate branches. Empirical results on mathematical and financial reasoning benchmarks show that this strategy improves accuracy by 22.6% over standard inference while operating 37% faster than conventional beam search with similar or higher performance. Our results show that dynamic resource allocation during inference can substantially improve both efficiency and effectiveness, offering a more scalable pathway to enhanced LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an intriguing ability of large language models (LLMs). Despite a substantial amount of work on its behavioral aspects and how it emerges in miniature setups, it remains unclear which mechanism assembles task information from the individual examples in a fewshot prompt. We use causal interventions to identify information flow in Gemma-2 2B for five naturalistic ICL tasks. We find that the model infers task information using a two-step strategy we call contextualize-then-aggregate: In the lower layers, the model builds up representations of individual fewshot examples, which are contextualized by preceding examples through connections between fewshot input and output tokens across the sequence. In the higher layers, these representations are aggregated to identify the task and prepare prediction of the next output. The importance of the contextualization step differs between tasks, and it may become more important in the presence of ambiguous examples. Overall, by providing rigorous causal analysis, our results shed light on the mechanisms through which ICL happens in language models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical, diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and unreliable answers. This paper introduces the Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG), an ontology-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations by explicitly modeling the formal structure and diachronic nature of legal norms. We ground our knowledge graph in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis, and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable, temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI systems.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context. Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's (LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over naive skill-based strategies.

Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4 multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked, and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models require both contextual knowledge and parametric memory, but these sources can disagree. Prior investigations on contextual question answering tasks report a preference toward parametric knowledge under conflict, yet they focus almost exclusively on tasks that should always rely on the given passage, leaving open how this behavior manifests when tasks demand different amounts and kinds of knowledge. We study this question with a model-agnostic diagnostic framework that (i) automatically detects disagreements between a model's beliefs and a curated knowledge set, and (ii) injects controlled conflicts into tasks. The resulting datasets span two orthogonal dimensions: task knowledge reliance and conflict plausibility. Evaluating representative open-source LLMs, we find that: (1) performance degradation from conflict correlates with a task's knowledge reliance; (2) explanatory rationales and simple reiteration both increase context reliance-helpful for context-only tasks but harmful when parametric knowledge should dominate; (3) These behaviors raise concerns about the validity of model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components, cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments, treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants (n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

Abstract: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

Abstract: Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench.

Abstract: Multilingual OCR and information extraction from receipts remains challenging, particularly for complex scripts like Arabic. We introduce \dataset, a comprehensive dataset designed for Arabic-English receipt understanding comprising 20,000 annotated receipts from diverse retail settings, 30,000 OCR-annotated images, and 10,000 item-level annotations, and a new Receipt QA subset with 1265 receipt images paired with 40 question-answer pairs each to support LLM evaluation for receipt understanding. The dataset captures merchant names, item descriptions, prices, receipt numbers, and dates to support object detection, OCR, and information extraction tasks. We establish baseline performance using traditional methods (Tesseract OCR) and advanced neural networks, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness for processing complex, noisy real-world receipt layouts. Our publicly accessible dataset advances automated multilingual document processing research (see https://github.com/Update-For-Integrated-Business-AI/CORU ).

Abstract: In recent years, multi-task prompt tuning has garnered considerable attention for its inherent modularity and potential to enhance parameter-efficient transfer learning across diverse tasks. This paper aims to analyze and improve the performance of multiple tasks by facilitating the transfer of knowledge between their corresponding prompts in a multi-task setting. Our proposed approach decomposes the prompt for each target task into a combination of shared prompts (source prompts) and a task-specific prompt (private prompt). During training, the source prompts undergo fine-tuning and are integrated with the private prompt to drive the target prompt for each task. We present and compare multiple methods for combining source prompts to construct the target prompt, analyzing the roles of both source and private prompts within each method. We investigate their contributions to task performance and offer flexible, adjustable configurations based on these insights to optimize performance. Our empirical findings clearly showcase improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to the conventional practice of prompt tuning and related works. Notably, our results substantially outperform other methods in the field in few-shot settings, demonstrating superior performance in various tasks across GLUE benchmark, among other tasks. This achievement is attained with a significantly reduced amount of training data, making our method a promising one for few-shot settings.

Abstract: Limited large-scale evaluations exist for facilitation strategies of online discussions due to significant costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create initial pilot experiments. We propose design principles based on existing methodologies for synthetic discussion generation. Based on these principles, we propose a simple, generalizable, LLM-driven methodology to prototype the development of LLM facilitators by generating synthetic data without human involvement, and which surpasses current baselines. We use our methodology to test whether current Social Science strategies for facilitation can improve the performance of LLM facilitators. We find that, while LLM facilitators significantly improve synthetic discussions, there is no evidence that the application of these strategies leads to further improvements in discussion quality. In an effort to aid research in the field of facilitation, we release a large, publicly available dataset containing LLM-generated and LLM-annotated discussions using multiple open-source models. This dataset can be used for LLM facilitator finetuning as well as behavioral analysis of current out-of-the-box LLMs in the task. We also release an open-source python framework that efficiently implements our methodology at great scale.

Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interacting with mobile GUIs. These agents allow users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions. However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors. To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA deterministically ensures that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before executing the action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification. This enables runtime, rule-based verification of agent's actions, detecting erroneous actions even before they take effect. To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agents, bridging the gap between LFM-driven actions and formal software verification. We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LFM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps. The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.33%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, outperforming existing LFM-based verification methods by 30.00%-16.33%, and increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet they often suffer from producing unnecessary and verbose reasoning chains. We identify a core aspect of this issue as "invalid thinking" -- models tend to repeatedly double-check their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs a novel combination of a Length Reward for overall conciseness and a Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant reduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in accuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression. Our analysis further validates the robustness of LC-R1 and provides valuable insights for developing more powerful yet computationally efficient LRMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/zxiangx/LC-R1.

Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language, particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification (BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and differences between the two languages makes the language identification task challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks, including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially, this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more integral and resilient property.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations. However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity, leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally. In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across 75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized value modeling, and equitable AI development.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing, they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks, limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps, this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations: (1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference. It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, persona prompting, false refusal, sociodemographic personas, biases

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are being personalized in daily interactions. Persona prompting can lead to false refusal of user requests, but the extent of this issue has not been fully quantified. This study investigates the impact of sociodemographic personas on false refusal, using various models, tasks, and prompt paraphrases. Results show that as models improve, personas have less impact on refusal rates. Certain sociodemographic personas can increase false refusal in some models, indicating potential biases in alignment strategies or safety mechanisms. Model choice and task also significantly influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. The findings suggest that persona effects may have been overestimated and could be attributed to other factors. This research sheds light on the implications of LLM personalization and the importance of addressing biases in language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models are increasingly personalized, with persona prompting potentially leading to false refusal of user requests. The study examines the impact of sociodemographic personas on false refusal, finding that as models improve, persona effects decrease. Certain personas can increase false refusals in some models, indicating biases in alignment strategies. Model choice and task also play a significant role in false refusals, particularly in sensitive content tasks. The findings suggest that persona effects may not be as pronounced as previously thought and could be influenced by other factors. Addressing biases in language models is crucial for mitigating unintended consequences. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15 sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models, 3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models, which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other factors.

<div> Keywords: semantic categories, Information Bottleneck, Large language models, color-naming study, cognitive theories

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) may possess the capacity to develop efficient semantic systems similar to human languages. Through a study in the domain of color categorization, LLMs like Gemini and Llama were evaluated based on their alignment with human color-naming patterns. Gemini displayed close resemblance to native English speakers and achieved high efficiency according to the Information Bottleneck principle. Llama, although efficient, exhibited slightly lower complexity compared to English. Furthermore, a simulation of cultural evolution in LLMs revealed that these models could iteratively refine their initial random systems towards greater efficiency and alignment with patterns observed in various languages worldwide. This study suggests that LLMs can evolve perceptually grounded, human-like semantic categories, governed by the principle of semantic efficiency seen across human languages.<br /><br />Summary: Large language models, such as Gemini and Llama, were tested in color categorization studies to assess their alignment with human patterns. Gemini showed similarity to English speakers and high efficiency, while Llama exhibited slightly lower complexity. Through simulation, LLMs demonstrated the ability to evolve efficient semantic systems akin to human languages. <div>
arXiv:2509.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB) complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English. Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded, human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

Summary: MERLIN, a two-stage model-stacking framework, addresses the challenge of complex reasoning in low-resource languages (LRLs) by leveraging a curriculum learning strategy and adapting a small set of DoRA weights. The model excels in improving accuracy on AfriMGSM benchmark (+12.9 pp) compared to existing methods like MindMerger and GPT-4o-mini. Additionally, MERLIN demonstrates consistent improvements in both low and high-resource settings, with gains of +0.9 pp on MGSM and +2.8 pp on MSVAMP benchmarks. This approach showcases the effectiveness of leveraging a curriculum learning strategy and adapting model weights to enhance performance in challenging language processing tasks across different resource settings. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN, a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini. It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp), demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

<div> transferability, bias transfer hypothesis, language models, prompting, debiasing<br />
Summary:<br />
- The study challenges the assumption that biases do not transfer from large pre-trained language models to adapted models, especially through prompting.
- Biases are found to transfer through prompting, with correlations existing between intrinsic biases and those after prompt adaptation in various demographics and tasks.
- Biases remain strongly correlated even when varying few-shot composition parameters.
- Various prompt-based debiasing strategies are evaluated, each with distinct strengths but none consistently reducing bias transfer.
- Correcting bias in intrinsic models may prevent the propagation of biases to downstream tasks and potentially improve reasoning ability. <div>
arXiv:2509.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age (rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models, tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

Summary:
Verbalized algorithms (VAs) propose a new approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing tasks into simple operations on natural language strings. By limiting the scope of LLMs to only these simple tasks, VAs aim to improve reliability in reasoning tasks. For example, in verbalized sorting, LLMs serve as binary comparison oracles in established sorting algorithms like bitonic sorting network. This approach has been shown to be effective in sorting and clustering tasks. By integrating classical algorithms with theoretical understanding, VAs offer a more structured way of utilizing LLMs for specific tasks, enhancing their performance and applicability in various domains. <div>

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example, for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting} uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

<div> Variation, Annotator reliability, Spam filtering, Label diversity, Machine learning
<br />
Summary: 
This study explores the balance between preserving variation in data labels and filtering out spam or low-quality responses in machine learning datasets. The research evaluates the effectiveness of different heuristics for annotator filtering on subjective tasks. It is found that conservative settings for annotator removal (<5%) yield the best results, as more aggressive methods lead to an increase in mean absolute error from the true average label. Analysis on synthetic spam reveals that existing spam filtering methods often mistakenly remove annotators who disagree instead of actual spam annotators. The study highlights the need for spam removal techniques that consider the preservation of label diversity, as spammers tend to be less random than non-spammers. These findings emphasize the importance of developing spam filtering methods tailored to tasks requiring the retention of variation in data labels.

arXiv:2509.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal (<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that account for label diversity.

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

<div> synthetic data, large language models, text detoxification, toxic content, lexical diversity <br />
<br />Summary: 
This paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating synthetic toxic data for text detoxification training. The study utilized Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models to create synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2 datasets. Results indicate that models trained on synthetic data underperform compared to those trained on human data, with a significant drop in performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The main issue identified is the lack of lexical diversity in LLM-generated toxic content, which mainly consists of repetitive insults, failing to capture the complexity and variety of human toxicity. The research underscores the importance of diverse, human-annotated data for developing effective detoxification systems and highlights the current limitations of LLMs in this domain. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community. This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2 datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small, repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated data for building robust detoxification systems.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Summary:<br />
Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) research faces challenges due to limited real human speech data and rigid generation templates in existing models. To address this, the authors introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a dataset of 20,000 real-human speech samples, and RPG-MoGe, a novel framework for SpeechRE. RPG-MoGe features a multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy and CNN-based latent relation prediction heads for improved cross-modal alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments demonstrate that RPG-MoGe outperforms existing methods and provides a benchmark dataset for SpeechRE research. The dataset and source code are publicly available, offering an effective solution for real-world SpeechRE tasks.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech. Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research. Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims, evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC, categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware defenses and highlight open research questions that require further exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of preserving high verification accuracy.

<div> Acquiescence bias, Large Language Models, survey responses, human influenceability, language tasks<br />
Summary:<br />
The study investigates acquiescence bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) across various models, tasks, and languages (English, German, Polish). It is known that humans tend to agree with statements in surveys regardless of their beliefs, a phenomenon called acquiescence bias. The researchers hypothesized that LLMs, being trained on human-generated data, might exhibit a similar bias. Surprisingly, the results show that LLMs display a bias towards answering negatively, regardless of whether it implies agreement or disagreement. This deviation from human behavior indicates a unique pattern in LLM responses that differs from typical acquiescence bias seen in humans. The findings suggest that LLMs may not mirror human response tendencies accurately, highlighting the need for further research in understanding and addressing biases in AI models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or disagreement.

<div> persona-prompting, linguistic abstraction, stereotypes, LLMs, social groups
Summary:
- The study explores how persona-prompting affects the levels of linguistic abstraction in language models (LLMs) when generating texts related to social groups.
- Three metrics (concreteness, specificity, negation) are used to measure linguistic abstraction in outputs from LLMs under different persona-prompting conditions.
- Results suggest that persona-prompting may not effectively modulate abstraction levels, potentially perpetuating stereotypes even when aiming to represent marginalized groups.
- The study introduces the Self-Stereo dataset, containing self-reported stereotypes from Reddit, to support the analysis.
- The findings raise concerns about the impact of persona-prompting on language representation and the potential propagation of stereotypes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

Summary: 
The study introduces TrinityX, a new modular alignment framework designed to improve the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH). TrinityX incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture to optimize alignment with HHH dimensions. Results from experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks show that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant improvements in win rate, safety score, and truthfulness. The framework also reduces memory usage and inference latency compared to prior methods. Ablation studies emphasize the importance of calibrated routing in achieving these results, and cross-model evaluations demonstrate TrinityX's generalization across various LLM backbones. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified, alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

<div> data selection, multilingual alignment, language models, preference optimization, consistency-based method

Summary:
Current large language models (LLMs) experience a performance gap in alignment between English and other languages. Existing research often relies on English responses as a reference for selecting optimal responses in other languages, but this approach has limitations. Some English responses are low quality and may lead to inaccurate alignment for other languages. Biased or heuristic methods are commonly used to create multilingual preference pairs, resulting in noisy data. To address these issues, a consistency-based data selection method called CM-Align is proposed. This method involves consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based construction of multilingual preference data. Experiments on three LLMs and common tasks show that CM-Align is effective in improving multilingual alignment and outperforms existing methods. This highlights the importance of constructing high-quality preference data for enhancing multilingual alignment in language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap, existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data.

Summary: 

This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question answering, specifically focusing on a Yes/No QA task. By employing an ensemble of zero-shot models, the researchers achieved state-of-the-art performance in domain-specific tasks without the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. The ensemble approach outperformed individual LLMs and even rivaled or surpassed domain-tuned systems. The study found that aggregating outputs from multiple LLM variants, such as models from Anthropic and Google, resulted in more accurate and robust answers. The research also emphasized the importance of precise information retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. It was discovered that while expanded contexts aim to provide valuable evidence, they can also lead to information dilution and model disorientation. Overall, the study establishes that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, combined with effective RAG pipelines, offer a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering. <div>

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast, complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

This study examines the extent of memorization by Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical field. Evaluating prevalent memorization across various adaptation scenarios, the study categorizes it as beneficial, uninformative, or harmful. It highlights the impact of memorization on development and adoption of LLMs in medicine, with recommendations to leverage beneficial memorization for domain-specific reasoning, minimize uninformative memorization for deeper learning, and mitigate harmful memorization to protect sensitive patient information. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding and managing memorization in LLMs to enhance the accuracy and ethical use of these models in the medical domain.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

arXiv:2509.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30% F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution. The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta = 0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and 44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of 2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are available at https://github.com/hyunjun1121/M2S-x-teaming.

<div> delayed streams modeling, sequence-to-sequence learning, streaming, multimodal, language model  
Summary:  
Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM) introduces a flexible formulation for streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. It allows for streaming sequence-to-sequence generation by modeling already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language model and introducing delays between streams. This enables streaming inference of arbitrary output sequences from any input combination, making it suitable for various sequence-to-sequence tasks. In experiments for tasks like automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS), DSM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and latency, supporting long sequences and even competing with offline baselines. The code, samples, and demos for DSM are available on GitHub at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/delayed-streams-modeling.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep. Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream. DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks, showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline baselines.

<div> Keywords: Transformer-based language models, factual recall, MLP modules, attention modules, autoregressive architectures

Summary:
This study investigates how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve factual associations, focusing on various models such as GPT, LLaMA, Qwen, and DeepSeek. Previous research has found that MLP modules in early layers are crucial for factual recall in GPT-style models. However, the study identifies a different pattern in Qwen-based models, where attention modules in the earliest layers play a more significant role in factual recall than MLP modules. This suggests that architectural variations within the autoregressive Transformer family can lead to distinct mechanisms of factual recall. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding how different models encode and access factual information, shedding light on potential avenues for improving interpretability and model editing in Transformer-based language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall. However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA, Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in reducing data annotation costs by using prompt-based tasks. However, evaluating the quality of LLM-generated annotations in unsupervised environments is challenging. This study proposes an agentic annotation paradigm where a student model collaborates with the LLM to assess and refine annotation quality without oracle feedback. The student model utilizes a majority voting strategy based on user preferences to evaluate the consistency of the LLM outputs. A novel unsupervised evaluation metric, the Consistent and Inconsistent (CAI) Ratio, is introduced to measure the reliability of LLM-generated annotations. The CAI Ratio demonstrates a strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, making it a valuable tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in dynamic environments. This approach is applied to ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, establishing the CAI Ratio as essential for assessing annotation quality in real-world settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators. However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent (CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

<div> Subword-based tokenization, morphological boundaries, low-resource languages, Geez script, MoVoC<br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces MoVoC, a method to enhance subword tokenization for languages with complex morphology like Geez script. MoVoC-Tok is developed, combining morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding tokens for better morphological integration. Manually annotated morpheme data for Geez script languages is curated and a morphology-aware vocabulary is created. Though not improving translation quality significantly, the approach shows consistent gains in intrinsic metrics like MorphoScore and Boundary Precision, emphasizing the importance of morphology-aware segmentation for linguistic fidelity. The morpheme-annotated datasets and tokenizer are made publicly available to aid research in low-resource, morphologically rich languages.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore, and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines, including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering insights for multilingual LLM development.

<div> LLM hacking, social science research, data annotation tasks, statistical conclusions, model selection<br />
Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing social science research by automating tasks like data annotation, but researchers' choices can lead to bias and errors known as LLM hacking. A study replicating 37 tasks found incorrect conclusions in one-third of hypotheses for advanced models and half for smaller ones. High performance reduces hacking risk, but even accurate models don't eliminate it, especially near significance thresholds. Human annotations are key for reducing false positives and improving model selection. Intentional LLM hacking is alarmingly simple, with just a few models and prompts enough to make anything seem statistically significant. Regression estimator corrections are limited in addressing hacking risks, as they trade off Type I and Type II errors. Overall, the study underscores the importance of careful model selection and human input in mitigating LLM hacking in social science research.  <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases, anything can be presented as statistically significant.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, overreliance, risks, measurement, mitigation

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are advanced technologies that serve as "thought partners" in natural language interactions, but the risk of overreliance on them is increasing. This paper highlights the potential dangers of overreliance on LLMs at both individual and societal levels, including errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Various characteristics of LLMs, system design features, and user biases contribute to concerns about overreliance. The paper also discusses historical approaches to measuring overreliance and proposes new directions for improvement in measurement techniques. Finally, mitigation strategies are suggested for the AI research community to ensure that LLMs enhance human capabilities rather than undermine them.

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models are valuable collaborators in natural language interactions, but their overreliance can lead to errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Factors such as LLM characteristics, system design, and user biases raise serious concerns about overreliance, necessitating improved measurement techniques. Mitigation strategies are essential to ensure that LLMs enhance human capabilities effectively. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) distinguish themselves from previous technologies by functioning as collaborative "thought partners," capable of engaging more fluidly in natural language. As LLMs increasingly influence consequential decisions across diverse domains from healthcare to personal advice, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities - grows. This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance must become central to LLM research and deployment. First, we consolidate risks from overreliance at both the individual and societal levels, including high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Then, we explore LLM characteristics, system design features, and user cognitive biases that - together - raise serious and unique concerns about overreliance in practice. We also examine historical approaches for measuring overreliance, identifying three important gaps and proposing three promising directions to improve measurement. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies that the AI research community can pursue to ensure LLMs augment rather than undermine human capabilities.

<div> XML tags, large language models, grammar-constrained decoding, hierarchical prompts, human-AI interaction

Summary: 
Structured prompting with XML tags is shown to be effective for guiding large language models towards parseable, schema-adherent outputs. A logic-first approach to XML prompting is developed, incorporating grammar-constrained decoding, fixed-point semantics over hierarchical prompts, and convergent human-AI interaction loops. A lattice of XML trees is formalized under a refinement order, with monotone prompt-to-prompt operators yielding least fixed points that define steady-state protocols. Task-aware contraction metrics on trees ensure Banach-style convergence of iterative guidance. Context-free grammars representing XML schemas enable constrained decoding to ensure well-formed outputs while maintaining task performance. Multi-layer human-AI interaction recipes illustrate practical deployment patterns, including multi-pass routines and agentic tool use. Complete mathematical proofs are provided, linking the framework to recent advancements in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic prompting.

Abstract: Structured prompting with XML tags has emerged as an effective way to steer large language models (LLMs) toward parseable, schema-adherent outputs in real-world systems. We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that unifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over lattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction loops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order and prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points (Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware contraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of iterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars (CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees well-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer human-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns, including multi-pass "plan $\to$ verify $\to$ revise" routines and agentic tool use. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic prompting.

Summary: <br />
Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods often rely on heuristics and static eviction policies, overlooking the interactions between layer-specific feature patterns and task performance. In response, EvolKV is introduced as an adaptive framework for layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression. By treating cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV utilizes evolutionary search to dynamically adjust layer budgets while maximizing downstream performance. Experiment results on 11 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of EvolKV over baseline methods, particularly excelling on long-context tasks and achieving up to a 7 percentage point improvement on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV showcases remarkable performance on code completion with only 1.5% of the original budget, showcasing the potential of learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation. <div>

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, human agency, large language models, benchmark, decision-making <br />
Summary: <br />
As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prominent in society, there is a growing concern about the loss of human control over our future. This paper proposes the concept of human agency in relation to AI and introduces a benchmark called HumanAgencyBench (HAB) to measure different dimensions of human agency in AI systems. The six dimensions include asking clarifying questions, avoiding value manipulation, correcting misinformation, deferring important decisions, encouraging learning, and maintaining social boundaries. The study shows that current AI assistants vary in their support for human agency, with some models excelling in certain dimensions while lacking in others. The findings suggest that simply increasing AI capabilities may not necessarily improve agency support, highlighting the need for a focus on safety and alignment objectives. The study calls for a more deliberate approach to developing AI systems that prioritize human agency and ethical considerations. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI), we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Generative Data Refinement (GDR) framework, which uses pretrained generative models to refine datasets with undesirable content for better training outcomes. It addresses the challenge of data exhaustion by transforming user-generated content not publicly indexed into suitable training data. GDR surpasses industry solutions for dataset anonymization and detoxification of unsafe datasets. By generating synthetic data conditioned on real examples, GDR produces outputs that match the diversity of web scale datasets without requiring additional prompting. This simplicity and effectiveness make GDR a valuable tool for expanding the total stock of training data for advanced models. <div>

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently, training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

This approach emphasizes exploitation in early stages and gradually transitions to exploration to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.

Summary:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are utilized for text-to-image (TTI) evaluation, but face biases and inconsistency. Standard ensembling methods are ineffective for TTI tasks. A new method, Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB), incorporates image clustering to assign prompt weights dynamically. MMB enhances accuracy in preference judgments and improves calibration for judge uncertainty. Evaluation on HPSv2 and MJBench benchmarks shows MMB outperforms baselines in alignment with human annotations and calibration across diverse image content. Multimodal-specific strategies are crucial for judge calibration in large-scale TTI evaluation, indicating a promising direction forward. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Summary: 
The article evaluates nine large language models (LLMs) for fact-checking across multiple languages and categories. It finds that smaller models show high confidence but lower accuracy, while larger models have higher accuracy but lower confidence. This poses a risk of systemic bias as smaller, more accessible models are often used by resource-constrained organizations. The performance gaps are most significant for non-English languages and claims from the Global South, which could worsen existing information inequalities. The study establishes a multilingual benchmark for future research and highlights the need for policy measures to ensure equitable access to reliable AI-assisted fact-checking. <div>

Abstract: The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures, reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions, with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.

It alternates between teacher-specific fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging to create a unified student model. MoT outperforms strong models on competition math benchmarks with only 200 samples, surpassing single-teacher distillation and naive multi-teacher union methods. It reduces overfitting, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics, and enhances teacher quality. MoT shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level teachers, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and enhances transfer of consensus-filtered reasoning features. This approach offers a simple and scalable way to distill complex reasoning capabilities from diverse teachers into compact student models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora. We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different "best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B, QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

<div> Keywords: benchmark, multi-modal large language models, rule manipulation, generalization, game

Summary:
The study introduces a benchmark based on the game Baba Is You to evaluate the problem-solving abilities of agents. The agents manipulate objects and rules represented by movable tiles with words to achieve specific goals in the game. Three state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, including OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, were tested on this benchmark. Results show significant failures in generalization when manipulating and combining the rules of the game. This highlights the limitations of current models in adapting to tasks that require redefining rules and objectives. The study underscores the importance of understanding human problem-solving mechanisms, which involve both following existing rules and procedures as well as creative leaps to redefine those rules. Further research is needed to develop models that can successfully handle tasks demanding rule manipulation and combination in game-like environments.

Abstract: Humans solve problems by following existing rules and procedures, and also by leaps of creativity to redefine those rules and objectives. To probe these abilities, we developed a new benchmark based on the game Baba Is You where an agent manipulates both objects in the environment and rules, represented by movable tiles with words written on them, to reach a specified goal and win the game. We test three state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5-Flash) and find that they fail dramatically when generalization requires that the rules of the game must be manipulated and combined.

Summary: <br /><br /> 
- The article introduces a new formalism called QASemConsistency for localizing factual inconsistencies in model-generated texts at a fine-grained level.
- Inspired by Neo-Davidsonian formal semantics, the methodology decomposes generated text into minimal predicate-argument level propositions expressed as question-answer pairs.
- Each question-answer pair corresponds to a semantic relation between a predicate and an argument, effectively pinpointing unsupported information in the text.
- Human annotation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QASemConsistency in identifying granular consistency errors, achieving substantial inter-annotator agreement.
- The methodology also yields factual consistency scores that correlate well with human judgments, and several automated detection methods using supervised entailment models and LLMs are implemented for detecting factual inconsistencies. <div>

Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in detecting hallucinations in model-generated texts, both manually and automatically, at varying levels of granularity. However, most existing methods fail to precisely pinpoint the errors. In this work, we introduce QASemConsistency, a new formalism for localizing factual inconsistencies in attributable text generation, at a fine-grained level. Drawing inspiration from Neo-Davidsonian formal semantics, we propose decomposing the generated text into minimal predicate-argument level propositions, expressed as simple question-answer (QA) pairs, and assess whether each individual QA pair is supported by a trusted reference text. As each QA pair corresponds to a single semantic relation between a predicate and an argument, QASemConsistency effectively localizes the unsupported information. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the QASemConsistency methodology for human annotation, by collecting crowdsourced annotations of granular consistency errors, while achieving a substantial inter-annotator agreement. This benchmark includes more than 3K instances spanning various tasks of attributable text generation. We also show that QASemConsistency yields factual consistency scores that correlate well with human judgments. Finally, we implement several methods for automatically detecting localized factual inconsistencies, with both supervised entailment models and LLMs.

Abstract: We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at accelerating or even autonomously performing work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications both for industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that the most competitive agent can complete 30% of tasks autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents--in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. We release code, data, environment, and experiments on https://the-agent-company.com.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Mone that aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of small medical language models for clinical applications. By using a curriculum strategy and Monte Carlo Tree Search, the framework constructs rule-verifiable reasoning trajectories. It then fine-tunes the policy model through reinforcement learning and preference learning. A unique soft dual process reward model is also introduced to penalize reasoning errors. Experimental results show that Mone outperforms previous state-of-the-art medical models and general-purpose reasoning models in accuracy. The framework demonstrates robust and faithful reasoning behavior, making it a promising tool for clinical reasoning applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Medical language models face critical barriers to real-world clinical reasoning applications. However, mainstream efforts, which fall short in task coverage, lack fine-grained supervision for intermediate reasoning steps, and rely on proprietary systems, are still far from a versatile, credible and efficient language model for clinical reasoning usage. To this end, we propose \mone, a self-evolving framework that imparts robust reasoning capabilities to small, deployable models. Starting with 8,000 curated instances sampled via a curriculum strategy across five medical domains and 16 datasets, we use a small base policy model to conduct Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for constructing rule-verifiable reasoning trajectories. Self-explored reasoning trajectories ranked by node values are used to bootstrap the policy model via reinforcement fine-tuning and preference learning. Moreover, we introduce a soft dual process reward model that incorporates value dynamics: steps that degrade node value are penalized, enabling fine-grained identification of reasoning errors even when the final answer is correct. Experiments on eleven benchmarks show that \mone outperforms the previous state-of-the-art medical model by +6.45 accuracy points and surpasses 32B-scale general-purpose reasoning models by +8.57 points. Additional empirical analysis further demonstrates that \mone achieves robust and faithful reasoning behavior.

Summary:
The research focuses on the development of the Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which combines the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm with associative memory to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Language Model Technologies. CoAT allows for structured exploration and adaptive learning, dynamically updating its knowledge base to generate accurate and comprehensive outputs. The framework outperforms existing models on generative and reasoning tasks, showing significant improvements in performance on various datasets. This innovative approach shifts the focus from 'fast thinking' to 'slow thinking', mirroring the human thought process by constantly associating and replenishing knowledge during reasoning. By enabling the exploration of diverse reasoning pathways and the incorporation of evolving information, CoAT demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the inference capabilities of LLM technologies. <div>

Abstract: Research on LLM technologies is rapidly emerging, with most of them employ a 'fast thinking' approach to inference. Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. We validate CoAT's effectiveness across a variety of generative and reasoning tasks. Quantitative experiments show that CoAT achieves over 10% performance improvement on open-source multi-hop reasoning datasets (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and more than 15% gain on our proprietary CRB dataset.

Summary: 
IssueBench is introduced as a tool to measure issue bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) by creating realistic English-language prompts based on real user interactions. The study reveals that issue biases are prevalent and consistent across 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, with a tendency to align more with US Democrat opinions on certain issues. By using IssueBench, the research aims to provide a robust and realistic measurement of LLM biases to address the risks associated with biased language models. The tool can be easily customized to include additional issues, templates, or tasks, enhancing the understanding of LLM biases and facilitating ongoing discussions on how to mitigate them. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2502.08395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are helping millions of users write texts about diverse issues, and in doing so expose users to different ideas and perspectives. This creates concerns about issue bias, where an LLM tends to present just one perspective on a given issue, which in turn may influence how users think about this issue. So far, it has not been possible to measure which issue biases LLMs manifest in real user interactions, making it difficult to address the risks from biased LLMs. Therefore, we create IssueBench: a set of 2.49m realistic English-language prompts to measure issue bias in LLM writing assistance, which we construct based on 3.9k templates (e.g. "write a blog about") and 212 political issues (e.g. "AI regulation") from real user interactions. Using IssueBench, we show that issue biases are common and persistent in 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. We also show that biases are very similar across models, and that all models align more with US Democrat than Republican voter opinion on a subset of issues. IssueBench can easily be adapted to include other issues, templates, or tasks. By enabling robust and realistic measurement, we hope that IssueBench can bring a new quality of evidence to ongoing discussions about LLM biases and how to address them.

<div> natural perturbations, machine reading comprehension, robustness evaluation, language models, Wikipedia edit history

Summary:
Natural perturbations in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models have been examined using a framework that replaces paragraphs in MRC benchmarks with counterparts based on Wikipedia edit history. These natural perturbations lead to performance degradation in pre-trained encoder language models, including state-of-the-art models like Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs). Training on naturally or synthetically perturbed examples can improve robustness to these perturbations, but there is still a noticeable performance gap compared to unperturbed data. This study highlights the importance of evaluating MRC models on real-world scenarios to ensure their robustness in practical applications. The findings emphasize the need for further research on developing more robust models that can effectively handle natural perturbations in textual data.

Abstract: As neural language models achieve human-comparable performance on Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and see widespread adoption, ensuring their robustness in real-world scenarios has become increasingly important. Current robustness evaluation research, though, primarily develops synthetic perturbation methods, leaving unclear how well they reflect real life scenarios. Considering this, we present a framework to automatically examine MRC models on naturally occurring textual perturbations, by replacing paragraph in MRC benchmarks with their counterparts based on available Wikipedia edit history. Such perturbation type is natural as its design does not stem from an arteficial generative process, inherently distinct from the previously investigated synthetic approaches. In a large-scale study encompassing SQUAD datasets and various model architectures we observe that natural perturbations result in performance degradation in pre-trained encoder language models. More worryingly, these state-of-the-art Flan-T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit these errors. Further experiments demonstrate that our findings generalise to natural perturbations found in other more challenging MRC benchmarks. In an effort to mitigate these errors, we show that it is possible to improve the robustness to natural perturbations by training on naturally or synthetically perturbed examples, though a noticeable gap still remains compared to performance on unperturbed data.

<title>REGen: A Reliable Evaluation Framework for Generative Event Argument Extraction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Event argument extraction identifies arguments for predefined event roles in text. Existing work evaluates this task with exact match (EM), where predicted arguments must align exactly with annotated spans. While suitable for span-based models, this approach falls short for large language models (LLMs), which often generate diverse yet semantically accurate arguments. EM severely underestimates performance by disregarding valid variations. Furthermore, EM evaluation fails to capture implicit arguments (unstated but inferable) and scattered arguments (distributed across a document). These limitations underscore the need for an evaluation framework that better captures models' actual performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce REGen, a Reliable Evaluation framework for Generative event argument extraction. REGen combines the strengths of exact, relaxed, and LLM-based matching to better align with human judgment. Experiments on six datasets show that REGen reveals an average performance gain of +23.93 F1 over EM, reflecting capabilities overlooked by prior evaluation. Human validation further confirms REGen's effectiveness, achieving 87.67% alignment with human assessments of argument correctness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based agents to successfully tackle interactive planning tasks. However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, , which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Chart Question Answering (CQA) evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on visual understanding and reasoning over chart data. However, existing benchmarks mostly test surface-level parsing, such as reading labels and legends, while overlooking deeper scientific reasoning. We propose DomainCQA, a framework for constructing domain-specific CQA benchmarks that emphasize both visual comprehension and knowledge-intensive reasoning. It integrates complexity-aware chart selection, multitier QA generation, and expert validation. Applied to astronomy, DomainCQA yields AstroChart, a benchmark of 1,690 QA pairs over 482 charts, exposing persistent weaknesses in fine-grained perception, numerical reasoning, and domain knowledge integration across 21 MLLMs. Fine-tuning on AstroChart improves performance across fundamental and advanced tasks. Pilot QA sets in biochemistry, economics, medicine, and social science further demonstrate DomainCQA's generality. Together, our results establish DomainCQA as a unified pipeline for constructing and augmenting domain-specific chart reasoning benchmarks.

<title>Scaling Video-Language Models to 10K Frames via Hierarchical Differential Distillation</title>

Abstract: Long-form video processing fundamentally challenges vision-language models (VLMs) due to the high computational costs of handling extended temporal sequences. Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLAMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at "mixed precision" through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLAMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLAMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLAMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Code and model are available at https://github.com/steven-ccq/ViLAMP.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning boosts large language models' (LLMs) performance on complex tasks but faces two key limitations: a lack of reliability when solely relying on LLM-generated reasoning chains and lower reasoning performance from natural language prompts compared with code prompts. To address these issues, we propose CoT-RAG, a novel reasoning framework with three key designs: (i) Knowledge Graph-driven CoT Generation, featuring knowledge graphs to modulate reasoning chain generation of LLMs, thereby enhancing reasoning credibility; (ii) Learnable Knowledge Case-aware RAG, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant sub-cases and sub-descriptions, providing LLMs with learnable information; (iii) Pseudo Program Prompting Execution, which promotes greater logical rigor by guiding LLMs to execute reasoning tasks as pseudo-programs. Evaluations on nine public datasets spanning three reasoning tasks reveal significant accuracy gains-ranging from 4.0% to 44.3%-over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, tests on four domain-specific datasets demonstrate exceptional accuracy and efficient execution, underscoring its practical applicability and scalability. Our code and data are available at https: //github.com/hustlfy123/CoT-RAG.

Abstract: This paper investigates prior prompt engineering (pPE) in the context of reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where language models (LMs) are incentivized to exhibit behaviors that maximize performance through reward signals. While existing RFT research has primarily focused on algorithms, reward shaping, and data curation, the design of the prior prompt--the instructions prepended to queries during training to elicit behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning--remains underexplored. We investigate whether different pPE approaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT. Inspired by inference-time prompt engineering (iPE), we translate five representative iPE strategies--reasoning, planning, code-based reasoning, knowledge recall, and null-example utilization--into corresponding pPE approaches. We experiment with Qwen2.5-7B using each of the pPE approaches, then evaluate performance on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., AIME2024, HumanEval+, and GPQA-Diamond). Our results show that all pPE-trained models surpass their iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach achieving the largest average performance gain and the highest improvement on AIME2024 and GPQA-Diamond, surpassing the commonly used reasoning approach. Furthermore, by adapting a behavior-classification framework, we demonstrate that different pPE strategies instill distinct behavioral styles in the resulting models. These findings position pPE as a powerful yet understudied axis for RFT.

To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets. Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off, with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach, REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering" strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking (ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is publicly available at:https://github.com/nxcc-lab/ARCE.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability, efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements, with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We open-source our models, training data, and codes in https://github.com/inclusionAI/ASearcher.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has transformed how we approach text generation tasks by grounding Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved knowledge. This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.

<title>Mind the Value-Action Gap: Do LLMs Act in Alignment with Their Values?</title>

Abstract: Existing research primarily evaluates the values of LLMs by examining their stated inclinations towards specific values. However, the "Value-Action Gap," a phenomenon rooted in environmental and social psychology, reveals discrepancies between individuals' stated values and their actions in real-world contexts. To what extent do LLMs exhibit a similar gap between their stated values and their actions informed by those values? This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance. These findings underscore the risks of relying solely on the LLMs' stated values to predict their behaviors and emphasize the importance of context-aware evaluations of LLM values and value-action gaps.

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-modal tasks, they are prone to generating hallucinatory text responses that do not align with the given visual input, which restricts their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/zhangce01/DeGF.

<title>Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?</title>

arXiv:2504.03814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

Abstract: Few-shot relational learning on knowledge graph (KGs) aims to perform reasoning over relations with only a few training examples. While existing methods have primarily focused on leveraging specific relational information, rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel prompted meta-learning (PromptMeta) framework that seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot relational learning. PromptMeta has two key innovations: (1) a Meta-Semantic Prompt (MSP) pool that learns and consolidates high-level meta-semantics, enabling effective knowledge transfer and adaptation to rare and newly emerging relations; and (2) a learnable fusion token that dynamically combines meta-semantics with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks. Both components are optimized jointly with model parameters within a meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments and analyses on two real-world KG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptMeta in adapting to new relations with limited data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone, a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410 expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters) focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical domain.

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains. However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets.

Discharge communication is a critical aspect of patient care that is often overlooked. The DischargeSim benchmark assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) to act as personalized discharge educators through simulated post-visit conversations. The benchmark evaluates dialogue quality, personalized document generation, and patient comprehension across different patient profiles. Results from 18 LLMs show significant gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying among patient profiles.

DischargeSim is a crucial step in benchmarking LLMs for post-visit clinical education and promoting personalized patient support.

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit, multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion). Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization. DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, uncertainty handling, moral principles, transparent natural language generation, trust calibration

Summary:
This article presents a framework for handling uncertainty in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) using rule-based moral principles. The framework incorporates rules such as precaution, deference, and responsibility to guide responses under different types of uncertainty. These rules are implemented in a lightweight Prolog engine, allowing for transparent and aligned system actions with plain-language rationales based on the level of uncertainty. Scenario-based simulations show that the framework covers a wide range of situations, ensuring fairness and trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains demonstrate how moral reasoning can enhance trust and interpretability in LLM-generated text. This approach provides a clear and ethical alternative to probabilistic models for socially responsible natural language generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings, where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty. These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially responsible natural language generation.

<div> migration, German political debate, large language models, (anti-)solidarity subtypes, German parliamentary debates 

Summary: 
Large language models are evaluated for annotating (anti-)solidarity subtypes in German parliamentary debates regarding migration. The study compares model performance with thousands of human reference annotations over historical and contemporary data, considering model size, prompting differences, and fine-tuning effects. The analysis reveals a high degree of migrant-directed solidarity in post-World War II Germany and a trend towards anti-solidarity in recent years. These findings emphasize the potential of LLMs for political text analysis and shed light on the importance of migration debates in a country facing demographic decline and labor shortages amidst rising polarization. <div>

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015, motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany, where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

<div> Lookahead Keys, Autoregressive Property, Attention Mechanism, Language Modeling, Downstream Tasks
Summary:
CASTLE introduces an attention mechanism called CAuSal aTtention with Lookahead kEys, which updates token keys as context unfolds, integrating information from later tokens while maintaining autoregressive properties. Although the mechanism appears sequential, it achieves efficient parallel training by deriving a mathematical equivalence that avoids materializing lookahead keys at each position. In language modeling benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention, reducing validation perplexity and enhancing performance on various downstream tasks. <div>

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a range of downstream tasks.

Summary:
The study introduces a new method called the Basis Vectors Method (BVM) for judging state changes in images using language embeddings. The method was tested on the MIT-States dataset, consisting of 53,000 images with noun-adjective pairs. In the first experiment, BVM outperformed other metrics in classifying noun states. However, in the second experiment, BVM did not show superiority in differentiating adjectives compared to logistic regression. Despite this, potential improvements were identified for enhancing the accuracy of the BVM approach. The study suggests that modifications to methodologies could increase the effectiveness of using BVM for image state classification and differentiation of adjectives. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about 53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115 adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product, product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network. Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new benchmark for predicting instance-level performance in long-form generation tasks with fine-grained quality metrics. It is task-, model-, and metric-agnostic, predicting continuous evaluation metric scores using only model inputs and outputs. The benchmark includes 11 datasets/tasks, multiple Language Model Models (LLMs), baselines, and metrics per task. The prediction model is capable of effectively predicting scores across tasks with only 16 training examples. Additionally, the benchmark requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point estimates. This new task and benchmark provide a valuable opportunity to drive progress in long-form generation tasks and offer practical baselines for adoption in current research and development efforts.

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs, baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

<div> pretraining, supervised fine tuning, knowledge analysis, data selection, large language models <br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations (KAMIR) as a novel approach for data selection in large language models. KAMIR leverages the model's internal representations to assess data by computing similarities between hidden states and final hidden states. Unlike previous methods, KAMIR does not rely on prompt engineering, making it applicable to a wide range of tasks. The approach selects data based on the model's familiarity with the input, even with a small dataset and simple classifier architecture. Experimental results across various task datasets demonstrate that training with less familiar data improves generalization performance in large language models. <div>
arXiv:2509.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these, SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements, while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization. Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture. Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces the Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP) framework to address the issue of attention collapse in Transformer-based models. By injecting multi-hop relationships through a belief propagation process, SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper layers and maintains Global Token Dependency (GTD) at task-appropriate levels. The proposed framework shows improvements in model performance, especially in small-scale models, making it suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. The SAOBP framework effectively captures long-range dependencies in self-attention mechanisms, highlighting its potential in enhancing inference quality. <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph. Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to more direct communication between humans and LLMs. However, LLMs face limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world conversations due to their inability to adapt their communication style and emotional expression. PersonaFuse is a novel post-training framework for LLMs that enables them to adapt and express different personalities for varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five personality model, PersonaFuse uses a Mixture-of-Expert architecture to combine persona adapters with a dynamic routing network for contextual trait expression. Experimental results show PersonaFuse outperforms baseline models in social-emotional intelligence without sacrificing general reasoning ability or model safety. It also improves human-centered applications like mental health counseling and review-based customer service and achieves competitive response quality with leading LLMs despite its smaller model size. PersonaFuse represents a significant advancement towards more human-centric AI systems.  <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement toward more human-centric AI systems.

Summary: <br />
Existing studies on large language models (LLM agents) have mainly focused on various aspects of linguistic competence but have not evaluated their ability to learn a language through pattern recognition and interactive feedback. A new experimental framework was proposed to assess an LLM agent's capability to acquire and use a newly constructed language, Tinkatongue, in conversation with a bot that understands only Tinkatongue. The results indicated that LLM agents struggled to establish a conversation within 100 responses, yet demonstrated distinct strategies reminiscent of human language learning approaches. This highlights the need for new evaluation benchmarks and suggests opportunities for enhancing model designs to improve learning from interactive feedback. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models (LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more effectively from interactive feedback.

Existing methods often struggle with KG traversal and reasoning limitations. To address this, the study proposes using lightweight exploration modules to enhance the SLM's performance. Experimental results show that these modules are effective in improving SLM performance on KG question answering tasks. The approach provides a more accessible and scalable solution compared to existing methods that rely on proprietary or large models.

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language models on knowledge graph question answering tasks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new benchmark called LongEmotion, specifically designed for Emotional Intelligence (EI) tasks in long-context scenarios. It includes tasks such as Emotion Classification, Detection, QA, Conversation, Summary, and Expression, with input lengths averaging 8,777 tokens. The benchmark utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM) to enhance performance under realistic constraints, outperforming standard prompt-based methods. The RAG method leverages conversation context and the language model as retrieval sources, while CoEM decomposes tasks into stages, incorporating retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge injection. Experimental results show consistent improvement in EI-related performance across tasks, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical EI applications. A comparative case study on the GPT series further demonstrates the models' differences in EI. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse, and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens, with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the differences among various models in terms of EI.

Summary: 
- Positive, supportive language in social media, known as candy speech, can promote civility.
- Automated detection of candy speech is not well-explored, hindering systematic analysis of its impact.
- Multilingual language models like XLM-RoBERTa are effective in detecting candy speech in a German YouTube corpus.

<br /><br />Summary: positive, supportive online communication, known as candy speech, can foster civility. However, its automated detection is limited, impeding thorough analysis. Through the use of multilingual language models, particularly XLM-RoBERTa, candy speech can be reliably detected in a German YouTube corpus.

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906) and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

Summary: 
Stigmatizing language in healthcare contributes to inequities, yet a universally accepted lexicon defining such language is lacking. A systematic review identified four existing lexicons, revealing moderate semantic similarity among them. The majority of stigmatizing terms are judgmental expressions used by clinicians to describe negative behaviors. Sentiment analysis indicated a prevalence of negatively classified terms, with variations across lexicons. The findings emphasize the necessity for a standardized lexicon in healthcare to address stigmatizing language and highlight the complexities in defining such language in clinical texts.

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive, negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors. Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Summary: <br />
This study examines the impact of data augmentation techniques on improving machine translation systems for low-resource African languages. Specifically, the researchers focus on sentence concatenation with back translation and switch-out methods across six African languages. The experiments demonstrate a significant enhancement in translation performance, with a minimum 25% increase in BLEU score for all languages tested. The findings suggest that these techniques have the potential to enhance machine translation systems for under-resourced languages, contributing to the development of more robust translation systems for diverse linguistic contexts. <div>

Abstract: The linguistic diversity across the African continent presents different challenges and opportunities for machine translation. This study explores the effects of data augmentation techniques in improving translation systems in low-resource African languages. We focus on two data augmentation techniques: sentence concatenation with back translation and switch-out, applying them across six African languages. Our experiments show significant improvements in machine translation performance, with a minimum increase of 25\% in BLEU score across all six languages.We provide a comprehensive analysis and highlight the potential of these techniques to improve machine translation systems for low-resource languages, contributing to the development of more robust translation systems for under-resourced languages.

<div> detecting content, hallucinations, generative language models, HALT-RAG, natural language inference<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces HALT-RAG, a verification system designed to detect hallucinations in the outputs of generative language models like RAG. HALT-RAG utilizes a feature set from NLI models and lexical signals to train a meta-classifier, achieving high F1-scores on tasks like summarization, QA, and dialogue. The system's well-calibrated probabilities enable a practical abstention mechanism for balancing model performance with safety requirements. By using a 5-fold out-of-fold training protocol, HALT-RAG prevents data leakage and provides unbiased estimates. Its flexible framework and task-adaptable design make it a reliable tool for identifying unsupported or contradictory content in generated text.<br />

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models. We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark. By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA, and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets. Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\% of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system (OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The codes, datasets and models are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/VeriOS.

<div> Keywords: large language models, knowledge editing, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-hop question answering, iterative method

Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) face challenges with outdated knowledge that traditional retraining cannot solve. Knowledge editing (KE) is necessary for updating information without changing parameters. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to "edit skipping." This issue arises from the complex nature of natural language expressions and granularity mismatches between LLMs and edited memory facts. A novel approach, Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing (IRAKE), addresses this problem by using guidance from single facts and full-edited cases. Experimental results show that IRAKE effectively prevents edit skipping and outperforms current KE methods in multi-hop question answering tasks. <div>

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of existing biomedical Language Models in understanding complex biomedical texts and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). To address this, the authors propose BALI, a method that enhances Language Models by incorporating external knowledge from KGs. By simultaneously training a dedicated KG encoder and aligning LM representations with KGs, BALI improves the performance of leading biomedical LMs like PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT on language understanding tasks. The method utilizes local KG subgraphs as positive samples for biomedical concept mentions in text, enhancing entity representations and overall comprehension of factual information encoded in KGs. Empirical results demonstrate that applying BALI leads to performance improvements with minimal pre-training on a small alignment dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Summary:<br />
Efficient communication is crucial for shared decision-making in healthcare. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and filled with jargon, posing challenges for domain experts in identifying key information. This paper presents a methodology for summarizing clinical case documents using an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language models (LLMs). By refining prompts through few-shot learning, the model achieves high ROUGE and BERTscores on clinical case reports. The use of perspective-aware ISP with GPT-4 and GPT-4o enhances semantic equivalence in the generated summaries compared to references. This approach enables better communication between patients and clinicians by providing concise and relevant summaries of complex clinical information. <div>

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P, R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

<div> document understanding, document question answering, multi-modal, logic-aware retrieval, large vision-language models

Summary:
MoLoRAG is a logic-aware retrieval framework for multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. It addresses the limitations of traditional methods by combining semantic and logical relevance in document retrieval. By constructing a page graph to capture contextual relationships between pages, MoLoRAG enables a lightweight VLM to perform graph traversal for more accurate retrieval. The framework offers two variants for flexibility: a training-free solution for easy deployment and a fine-tuned version to enhance logical relevance checking. Experimental results on four DocQA datasets show significant improvements in accuracy and retrieval precision over baselines. MoLoRAG demonstrates an average accuracy improvement of 9.68% over LVLM direct inference and a retrieval precision improvement of 7.44%. The codes and datasets for MoLoRAG are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task. Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance, ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking. Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over baselines. Codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges of manual annotation in Relation Extraction (RE) tasks, highlighting the scarcity of relevant training data. It introduces a framework called M-BRe that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract training instances from unlabeled texts for RE. The framework consists of three modules: Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, and Label Decision, which combine the advantages of multi-class and binary classification approaches. By addressing the limitations of LLMs in capturing the semantics of relations and reducing computational overhead, M-BRe significantly improves the quality of training samples extracted from unlabeled texts for RE tasks. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance in discovering high-quality training instances, making it a promising solution for efficient and effective relation extraction from textual data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks, with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second, although employing binary classification for each relation individually can mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead, resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled texts for RE.

<div> Keywords: large language models, watermarking, medical domains, factual accuracy, coherence

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly used in sensitive domains like medicine, but their fluency can pose risks in terms of provenance and accountability. Watermarking is one approach to address these risks by embedding detectable patterns, but its effectiveness in medical contexts has not been thoroughly tested. This article introduces a medical-focused evaluation workflow that considers both factual accuracy and coherence, using a composite metric called the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS) to prioritize accuracy. The evaluation reveals that current watermarking methods tend to compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts leading to degradation in medical entity representation. This highlights the importance of developing domain-aware watermarking techniques that can maintain the integrity of medical content. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical content.

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup - in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain. Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

Summary: 

The article addresses the challenges of utilizing both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge in textual response generation for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems. Existing methods often neglect unstructured knowledge and underutilize large language models. The proposed DK2R model aims to fully leverage dual knowledge using a two-stage reasoning approach with large language models. It first extracts structured and unstructured knowledge from external sources and evaluates their utility through an LLM. Additionally, DK2R identifies intention-oriented clues through dedicated reasoning to enhance response generation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DK2R compared to existing methods. The code and parameters for DK2R have been made publicly available. <div>

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented} dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2) \textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released the codes and parameters.

Summary:<br /><br />TF2 introduces a framework for English-Romanian literary translation using a compact, fine-tuned language model (TF2-12B) and synthetic parallel datasets. By leveraging existing datasets and fine-tuning techniques, TF2 aims to address the challenges in translating literary texts with small open models. The pipeline includes generating high-quality Romanian references, fine-tuning the model for genre-specific narrative style, and evaluating translation quality based on corpus-level BLEU scores and a five-dimensional rubric. Results demonstrate the fluency and adequacy of the fine-tuned model, rivaling large proprietary models while being cost-effective and open for access. The release of datasets, scripts, and evaluation prompts further promotes research in efficient translation and cross-lingual narrative generation, particularly in low-resource language settings. TF2 presents a reproducible pipeline for leveraging open models in translating culturally significant literary content.

We contribute to this ongoing research by introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets (DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

<div> sensitivity, prompt modifications, human annotators, language models, text classification<br />
Summary:<br />
The study examines the impact of prompt modifications on both humans and large language models (LLMs) in text classification tasks. It explores whether humans and LLMs react similarly to changes in instructions. The research finds that both humans and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness when faced with specific prompt modifications, particularly those involving alternative label sets or formats. However, human judgments are less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order compared to LLMs. This suggests that while both humans and LLMs display sensitivity to prompt changes, the degree of impact differs between the two groups. The study raises questions about prompt brittleness in LLMs and its implications for annotation variances, shedding light on the non-determinism and stability issues in LLM outputs.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs. This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of LLMs.

Our team presented a solution for sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese, achieving fourth place in NLPCC-2025 Shared Task 7. We used large language models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for bias detection, balanced training data, and heterogeneous samples for model generalization. A majority voting strategy improved performance in detection and classification. We also developed a multi-temperature sampling mechanism to detect and mitigate bias.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias. To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance. Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared task.

Summary: 
The article discusses the impact of biases and stereotypes in stories generated by large language models, particularly in children's bedtime stories. The dataset Biased Tales is introduced to analyze how biases influence protagonist attributes and story elements in these narratives. The analysis reveals significant disparities based on the gender and cultural background of the protagonist. Stories featuring girls tend to focus more on appearance-related attributes, while narratives with non-Western children emphasize cultural heritage and family themes disproportionately. These findings underscore the importance of addressing sociocultural bias in AI-generated stories to promote diversity and equity in creative content. <div>

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

Summary: <br />
Uncertainty estimation is crucial for improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications. Existing methods often lack in capturing semantic dependencies and structural relationships within generated text, leading to inaccurate confidence assessments. To address this, GENUINE is introduced, a framework that utilizes dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to enhance uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE effectively models semantic and structural relationships, resulting in improved confidence assessments. Experimental results across various NLP tasks demonstrate the superiority of GENUINE, achieving up to 29% higher AUROC compared to semantic entropy-based approaches and reducing calibration errors by over 15%. The code for GENUINE is available for access at https://github.com/ODYSSEYWT/GUQ. <br /> <div>

<div> Keywords: parallel thinking, large language models, reinforcement learning, real-world reasoning tasks, exploration

Summary:
Parallel-R1 introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models through parallel thinking. By employing a progressive curriculum that addresses the cold-start problem, the framework first utilizes supervised fine-tuning on easier tasks to instill parallel thinking abilities before transitioning to reinforcement learning for more complex tasks. Experiments on various math benchmarks demonstrate that Parallel-R1 significantly improves accuracy compared to models trained directly on challenging tasks with reinforcement learning. The model's thinking behavior shifts from using parallel thinking as an exploration strategy to multi-perspective verification. Furthermore, the study validates parallel thinking as a mid-training exploration scaffold, unlocking a higher performance ceiling after reinforcement learning. The open-source model, data, and code are available on GitHub at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL, yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

<div> Keywords: large language models, decoding-time safety alignment, guard model, rollback mechanism, introspection

Summary: 
CARE is a new framework for ensuring the safety of outputs during decoding by integrating a guard model for real-time safety monitoring, a rollback mechanism for efficient corrections, and an introspection-based intervention strategy. The framework aims to achieve a superior balance between safety, quality, and efficiency in large language models. By using the guard model for precise interventions, the rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and the introspection method for self-correction, CARE effectively detects and corrects potentially unsafe content without disrupting the user experience. Experimental results show that the framework maintains high response quality while minimizing harmful response rates and ensuring safety. Overall, CARE offers a novel approach to decoding-time safety alignment in large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience; and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety, quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces the ViLD framework, aimed at bridging the gap between academic evaluation and enterprise deployment requirements for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It defines ten business-critical tasks and presents the BlockWeaver Algorithm to compare OCR outputs efficiently. A benchmark dataset of 7,500 diverse samples is created for evaluation. ViLD combines semantic matching, traditional metrics, and novel methods to assess VLM capabilities accurately. Leading open-source VLMs are benchmarked against a proprietary baseline, providing insights for their deployment in enterprise environments. This framework offers a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs on operational enterprise needs like logo detection, object detection, human presence analysis, and more. <div>

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis, scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500 diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise environments.

To showcase the framework's capability to operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository, we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe deployment in diverse global contexts.

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment, adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures, while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions, and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable real-world GUI task automation.

Summary: <br />
Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural and symbolic processing for reliable problem-solving. While offering explainability and interpretability of symbolic reasoning and the power of neural computing, NeSy frameworks face challenges like a steep learning curve and lack of user-friendly tools. This paper examines existing NeSy frameworks' technical aspects like symbolic languages, integration with neural models, and algorithms. Existing research focuses on algorithms rather than providing generic problem-solving frameworks. Three frameworks, DeepProbLog, Scallop, and DomiKnowS, are highlighted to showcase Neurosymbolic modeling. Challenges within each framework are identified to assess their problem-solving capabilities. The aim is to inspire innovative approaches and encourage the community to rethink Neurosymbolic frameworks. <div>

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve, lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper, we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog}, \textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this problem in novel ways.

Summary:
The article introduces the Effective Information Consistency Score (EICS) as a way to quantify the coherence and trustworthiness of Transformer Circuits (TCs) within large language models. EICS combines normalized sheaf inconsistency with a Gaussian effective information proxy to assess causal emergence at the circuit level. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and dimensionless, making units explicit for easier interpretation. Practical guidance on interpretation, computational overhead, and a toy analysis is provided. Empirical validation on language model tasks is pending. <div>

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is deferred.

Summary: 
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) is introduced as a novel approach to address limitations in the traditional retrieve-and-rerank pipeline. By directly retrieving documents based on reranker preferences rather than sequentially reranking, RGS strategically prioritizes promising documents for reranking using approximate nearest neighbor algorithms and document similarity. Experimental results show significant performance improvements on multiple benchmarks within a constrained reranker budget. The method enhances retrieval accuracy by 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9 on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR. This study highlights that strategically selecting documents for reranking can deliver notable accuracy gains under restricted reranker budgets. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations: they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents, and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9 on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100 documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

Summary: 
The study introduces the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification, aiming to improve the accuracy of identifying legal problems faced by individuals seeking help. Misdirection can have serious consequences, such as missing deadlines or experiencing abuse while waiting for appropriate legal assistance. The classifier achieves a high accuracy of 97.37% using a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble method and generating follow-up questions to enhance problem narratives. The evaluation is based on a dataset of 419 real-world queries to a lawyer referral service. The results show that the approach outperforms the current GPT-5 model, offering a cost-effective solution to guide legal aid users efficiently to the right resources for their specific issues. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences. Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419 real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models, exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high accuracy.

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography (EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of 10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations. Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production more accessible and efficient.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text-based tasks, but retrieval models have not yet reached the same level of capability. To address this gap, researchers have created a set of diverse and realistic complex retrieval tasks to evaluate state-of-the-art retrieval models. Results show that even the best models struggle to achieve high-quality retrieval results, with the highest average nDCG@10 and R@100 scores being relatively low. Furthermore, the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval quality was explored, with mixed results – weaker models benefited from augmentation, but the strongest model performance decreased with all rewriting techniques. This research aims to drive innovation in next-generation retrieval models by providing a comprehensive assessment of their abilities on complex real-world retrieval tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable, applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts, constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346 and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics with all rewriting techniques.

Summary: 
The study focuses on using cryptogram solving as a testbed to investigate neural network generalization in complex domains. ALICE, an encoder-only Transformer model, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed in decrypting text encoded with substitution ciphers. Surprisingly, ALICE can generalize to unseen ciphers with minimal training data. The model employs a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly models permutations using the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, allowing for the direct extraction of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, it is revealed that ALICE progressively refines its predictions by employing frequency-based heuristics in early layers, forming word structures in middle layers, and correcting individual characters in final layers. The architectural innovations and analysis methods introduced in this study have implications beyond cryptograms, offering insights into neural network generalization and interpretability in domains with bijective mappings and combinatorial structures.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction ($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics, middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure, offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven baselines.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy. Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/GLEAM.

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning. Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations, optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) -- Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency, single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors -- are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on over 500K hours of data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations. However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale, open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular, scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full pipeline and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/AI-4-Everyone/Visual-TableQA.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses (those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning, thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Abstract: Personality is a crucial factor that shapes human communication patterns, thereby regulating the personalities of large language models (LLMs) holds significant potential in enhancing their user experiences. Previous approaches either relied on fine-tuning LLMs on specific corpora or required manually crafted prompts to evoke specific personalities from LLMs. However, the former is inefficient and costly, while the latter cannot precisely manipulate personality traits at a fine-grained level. To address these challenges, we propose UPLex, a method that uses an Unsupervisedly-Built Personalized Lexicon (UPL) during the decoding phase to manipulate LLM's personality traits. UPL can be constructed from a newly built situational judgment test dataset in an unsupervised fashion, and used to modulate the personality expression of LLMs by dynamically altering their predicted probability of upcoming words in a pluggable fashion. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the remarkable effectiveness and pluggability of our method for fine-grained manipulation of LLMs' personalities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the lack of tourism knowledge limits the performance of LLMs in tourist attraction presentations and travel planning. To address this challenge, we constructed a supervised fine-tuning dataset for the Chinese culture and tourism domain, named Cultour. This dataset consists of three parts: tourism knowledge base data, travelogues data, and tourism QA data. Additionally, we propose CTourLLM, a Qwen-based model supervised fine-tuned with Cultour, to improve the quality of information about attractions and travel planning. To evaluate the performance of CTourLLM, we proposed a human evaluation criterion named RRA (Relevance, Readability, Availability), and employed both automatic and human evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that CTourLLM outperforms ChatGPT, achieving an improvement of 1.21 in BLEU-1 and 1.54 in Rouge-L, thereby validating the effectiveness of the response outcomes. Our proposed Cultour is accessible at https://github.com/mrweiqk/Cultour.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

Abstract: With the continuous advancement in the performance of large language models (LLMs), their demand for computational resources and memory has significantly increased, which poses major challenges for efficient inference on consumer-grade devices and legacy servers. These devices typically feature relatively weaker GPUs and stronger CPUs. Although techniques such as parameter offloading and partial offloading can alleviate GPU memory pressure to some extent, their effectiveness is limited due to communication latency and suboptimal hardware resource utilization. To address this issue, we propose Dovetail, a lossless inference acceleration method that leverages the complementary characteristics of heterogeneous devices and the advantages of speculative decoding. Dovetail deploys a draft model on the GPU to perform preliminary predictions, while a target model running on the CPU validates these outputs. By reducing the granularity of data transfer, Dovetail significantly minimizes communication overhead. To further improve efficiency, we optimize the draft model specifically for heterogeneous hardware environments by reducing the number of draft tokens to lower parallel verification latency, increasing model depth to enhance predictive capabilities, and introducing a Dynamic Gating Fusion (DGF) mechanism to improve the integration of feature and embedding information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of Dovetail across various consumer-grade GPUs, covering multiple tasks and mainstream models. Experimental results on 13B models demonstrate that Dovetail achieves inference speedups ranging from 1.79x to 10.1x across different devices, while maintaining consistency and stability in the distribution of generated texts.

Abstract: The prototyping of computer games, particularly card games, requires extensive human effort in creative ideation and gameplay evaluation. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate and streamline these processes. However, it remains challenging for LLMs to design novel game mechanics beyond existing databases, generate consistent gameplay environments, and develop scalable gameplay AI for large-scale evaluations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive automated card game prototyping framework. The approach highlights a graph-based indexing method for generating novel game variations, an LLM-driven system for consistent game code generation validated by gameplay records, and a gameplay AI constructing method that uses an ensemble of LLM-generated heuristic functions optimized through self-play. These contributions aim to accelerate card game prototyping, reduce human labor, and lower barriers to entry for game developers.

<title>MEMIT-Merge: Addressing MEMIT's Key-Value Conflicts in Same-Subject Batch Editing for LLMs</title>

Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up, knowledge editing techniques that modify models' internal knowledge without full retraining have gained significant attention. MEMIT, a prominent batch editing algorithm, stands out for its capability to perform mass knowledge modifications. However, we uncover that MEMIT's editing efficacy significantly deteriorates when processing batches containing multiple edits sharing the same subject. Our analysis reveals this stems from MEMIT's key value modeling framework: identical keys (derived from the shared subject) are forced to represent different values (corresponding to different knowledge), resulting in update conflicts during editing. Addressing this issue, we propose MEMIT-Merge, an enhanced approach that merges value computation processes for facts sharing the same subject, effectively resolving the performance degradation in samesubject batch editing scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that when MEMIT's edit success rate drops to around 50% at larger batch sizes, MEMIT-Merge maintains a success rate exceeding 90%, showcasing remarkable robustness to subject entity collisions. The code is available at https://github.com/NUSTM/ MEMIT-Merge.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial task in information extraction and sentiment analysis, aiming to identify aspects with associated sentiment elements in text. However, existing ABSA datasets are predominantly English-centric, limiting the scope for multilingual evaluation and research. To bridge this gap, we present M-ABSA, a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains and 21 languages, making it the most extensive multilingual parallel dataset for ABSA to date. Our primary focus is on triplet extraction, which involves identifying aspect terms, aspect categories, and sentiment polarities. The dataset is constructed through an automatic translation process with human review to ensure quality. We perform extensive experiments using various baselines to assess performance and compatibility on M-ABSA. Our empirical findings highlight that the dataset enables diverse evaluation tasks, such as multilingual and multi-domain transfer learning, and large language model evaluation, underscoring its inclusivity and its potential to drive advancements in multilingual ABSA research.

Abstract: Hateful memes have become a significant concern on the Internet, necessitating robust automated detection systems. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in hateful meme detection, they face notable challenges like sub-optimal performance and limited out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Recent studies further reveal the limitations of both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning when applied to LMMs in this setting. To address these issues, we propose a robust adaptation framework for hateful meme detection that enhances in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization while preserving the general vision-language capabilities of LMMs. Analysis reveals that our approach achieves improved robustness under adversarial attacks compared to SFT models. Experiments on six meme classification datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger agentic systems. Moreover, our method generates higher-quality rationales for explaining hateful content compared to standard SFT, enhancing model interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-entity question answering (MEQA) represents significant challenges for large language models (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which frequently struggle to consolidate scattered information across diverse documents. While existing methods excel at single-document comprehension, they often struggle with cross-document aggregation, particularly when resolving entity-dense questions like "What is the distribution of ACM Fellows among various fields of study?", which require integrating entity-centric insights from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Wikipedia pages). To address this gap, we introduce MEBench, a novel multi-document, multi-entity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capacity to retrieve, consolidate, and reason over fragmented information. Our benchmark comprises 4,780 questions which are systematically categorized into three primary categories, further divided into eight distinct types, ensuring broad coverage of real-world multi-entity reasoning scenarios. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3) and RAG pipelines reveal critical limitations: even advanced models achieve only 59% accuracy on MEBench. Our benchmark emphasizes the importance of completeness and factual precision of information extraction in MEQA tasks, using Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric for granular evaluation of entity-level correctness and attribution validity. MEBench not only highlights systemic weaknesses in current LLM frameworks but also provides a foundation for advancing robust, entity-aware QA architectures.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in expanding their application beyond text-based tasks. A large number of studies have explored integrating other modalities with LLMs, notably speech modality, which is naturally related to text. This paper surveys the integration of speech with LLMs, categorizing the methodologies into three primary approaches: text-based, latent-representation-based, and audio-token-based integration. We also demonstrate how these methods are applied across various speech-related applications and highlight the challenges in this field to offer inspiration for

<title>Local Normalization Distortion and the Thermodynamic Formalism of Decoding Strategies for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Advances in hardware and language model architecture have spurred a revolution in natural language generation. However, autoregressive models compute probability distributions over next-token choices, and sampling from these distributions, known as decoding, has received significantly less attention than other design choices. Existing decoding strategies are largely based on heuristics, resulting in methods that are difficult to apply or improve in a principled manner. We develop the theory of decoding strategies for language models by expressing popular decoding algorithms as equilibrium states in the language of ergodic theory and stating the objective functions they optimize. Using this, we analyze the effect of the local normalization step required to make probabilities sum to one in top-k, nucleus, and temperature sampling. We argue that local normalization distortion is a fundamental defect of decoding strategies and quantify the size of this distortion and its effect on mathematical proxies for the quality and diversity of generated text. This yields conclusions for the design of decoding algorithms and the detection of machine-generated text.

<title>Register Always Matters: Analysis of LLM Pretraining Data Through the Lens of Language Variation</title>

Abstract: Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM) development, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web corpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labelling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters are deemed as valuable examples, others are discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilising registers or genres - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We train small generative models with register classified data and evaluate them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.

Abstract: With the shift from traditional to digital media, the online landscape now hosts not only reliable news articles but also a significant amount of unreliable content. Digital media has faster reachability by significantly influencing public opinion and advancing political agendas. While newspaper readers may be familiar with their preferred outlets political leanings or credibility, determining unreliable news articles is much more challenging. The credibility of many online sources is often opaque, with AI generated content being easily disseminated at minimal cost. Unreliable news articles, particularly those that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, closely mimic the topics and writing styles of credible sources, making them difficult to distinguish. To address this, we introduce SemCAFE, a system designed to detect news reliability by incorporating entity relatedness into its assessment. SemCAFE employs standard Natural Language Processing techniques, such as boilerplate removal and tokenization, alongside entity level semantic analysis using the YAGO knowledge base. By creating a semantic fingerprint for each news article, SemCAFE could assess the credibility of 46,020 reliable and 3,407 unreliable articles on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our approach improved the macro F1 score by 12% over state of the art methods. The sample data and code are available on GitHub

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation systems is challenging due to the diversity of valid outputs. While human evaluation is the gold standard, it suffers from inconsistencies, lack of standardisation, and demographic biases, limiting reproducibility. LLM-based evaluators offer a scalable alternative but are highly sensitive to prompt design, where small variations can lead to significant discrepancies. In this work, we propose an inversion learning method that learns effective reverse mappings from model outputs back to their input instructions, enabling the automatic generation of highly effective, model-specific evaluation prompts. Our method requires only a single evaluation sample and eliminates the need for time-consuming manual prompt engineering, thereby improving both efficiency and robustness. Our work contributes toward a new direction for more robust and efficient LLM-based evaluation.

Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained over extensive corpora risk memorizing sensitive, copyrighted, or toxic content. To address this, we propose \textbf{OBLIVIATE}, a robust unlearning framework that removes targeted data while preserving model utility. The framework follows a structured process: extracting target tokens, building retain sets, and fine-tuning with a tailored loss function comprising three components -- masking, distillation, and world fact. Using low-rank adapters (LoRA) ensures efficiency without compromising unlearning quality. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets, including Harry Potter series, WMDP, and TOFU, using a comprehensive suite of metrics: \emph{forget quality} (via a new document-level memorization score), \emph{model utility}, and \emph{fluency}. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in resisting membership inference attacks, minimizing the impact on retained data, and maintaining robustness across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o. Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP. Our model, codes, and datasets are released at https://github.com/EQUES-Inc/pharma-LLM-eval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a vital role in the financial domain, powering applications such as real-time market analysis, trend forecasting, and interest rate computation. However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a critical task in natural language processing that aims to transform natural language questions into accurate and executable SQL queries. In real-world scenarios, these reasoning tasks are often accompanied by complex mathematical computations, domain knowledge, and hypothetical reasoning scenarios. However, existing large-scale Text-to-SQL datasets typically focus on business logic and task logic, neglecting critical factors such as vertical domain knowledge, complex mathematical reasoning, and hypothetical reasoning, which are essential for realistically reflecting the reasoning demands in practical applications and completing data querying and analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicCat, the first Text-to-SQL benchmark dataset specifically designed for complex reasoning and chain-of-thought parsing, encompassing physics, arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning scenarios. LogicCat comprises 4,038 English questions paired 12,114 detailed chain-of-thought reasoning steps, spanning 45 databases across diverse domains, significantly surpassing existing datasets in complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicCat substantially increases the task difficulty for current state-of-the-art models to at most 33.20% execution accuracy, indicating that this task remains exceptionally challenging. The advancement of LogicCat represents a crucial step toward developing systems suitable for real-world enterprise data analysis and autonomous query generation. We have released our dataset code at https://github.com/Ffunkytao/LogicCat.

Abstract: While text-based emotion recognition methods have achieved notable success, real-world dialogue systems often demand a more nuanced emotional understanding than any single modality can offer. Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) has thus emerged as a crucial direction for enhancing the naturalness and emotional understanding of human-computer interaction. Its goal is to accurately recognize emotions by integrating information from various modalities such as text, speech, and visual signals.
  This survey offers a systematic overview of MERC, including its motivations, core tasks, representative methods, and evaluation strategies. We further examine recent trends, highlight key challenges, and outline future directions. As interest in emotionally intelligent systems grows, this survey provides timely guidance for advancing MERC research.

Abstract: We present a study on how and where personas -- defined by distinct sets of human characteristics, values, and beliefs -- are encoded in the representation space of large language models (LLMs). Using a range of dimension reduction and pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism -- suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions. These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation of specific human traits in LLM outputs. Warning: This paper includes potentially offensive sample statements.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in diverse applications, where they are assigned a specific persona - such as a happy high school teacher - to guide their responses. While prior research has examined how well LLMs adhere to predefined personas in writing style, a comprehensive analysis of consistency across different personas and task types is lacking. In this paper, we introduce a new standardized framework to analyze consistency in persona-assigned LLMs. We define consistency as the extent to which a model maintains coherent responses when assigned the same persona across different tasks and runs. Our framework evaluates personas across four different categories (happiness, occupation, personality, and political stance) spanning multiple task dimensions (survey writing, essay generation, social media post generation, single turn, and multi-turn conversations). Our findings reveal that consistency is influenced by multiple factors, including the assigned persona, stereotypes, and model design choices. Consistency also varies across tasks, increasing with more structured tasks and additional context. All code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive abilities that previously received limited attention in systematic LLM benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600 meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human level on this task.

<title>MEMOIR: Lifelong Model Editing with Minimal Overwrite and Informed Retention for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models efficiently and reliably-without retraining or forgetting previous information-remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction, and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks for LLaMA-3 and Mistral backbones demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach to language posits that language comprises a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience. We analyze representations of the English Double Object (DO) and Prepositional Object (PO) constructions in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of $5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied by human-rated preference strength for DO or PO. Geometric analyses show that the separability between the two constructions' representations, as measured by energy distance or Jensen-Shannon divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength, which depends on lexical and functional properties of sentences. That is, more prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in activation space, compared to sentences that could have equally well have occured in either construction. These results provide evidence that LLMs learn rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer support for geometric measures for representations in LLMs.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier training, types and their utility in test-time scaling.

Abstract: Large language models have consistently struggled with complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving. Investigating the internal reasoning mechanisms of these models can help us design better model architectures and training strategies, ultimately enhancing their reasoning capability. In this study, we constructed a symbolic multi-step reasoning task to investigate the information propagation mechanisms in Transformer models when solving the task through direct answering and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We introduced the concept of buffer mechanism: the model stores various information in distinct buffers and selectively extracts it through the query-key matrix. We proposed a random matrix-based algorithm to enhance the model's reasoning ability. This algorithm introduces only 132 trainable parameters, yet leads to significant performance improvements on 7 multi-step reasoning datasets, including PrOntoQA, LogicAsker, and LogicInference. These findings provide new insights into understanding the large language models.

Abstract: Instruction tuning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generally involves cooperative learning between a backbone LLM and a feature encoder of non-text input modalities. The major challenge is how to efficiently find the synergy between the two modules so that LLMs can adapt their reasoning abilities to downstream tasks while feature encoders can adjust to provide more task-specific information about its modality. In this paper, we analyze the MLLM instruction tuning from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, where we find the unbalanced learning between the feature encoder and the LLM can cause problems of oscillation and biased learning that lead to sub-optimal convergence. Inspired by our findings, we propose a Multimodal Balance Coefficient that enables quantitative measurement of the balance of learning. Based on this, we further design a dynamic learning scheduler that better coordinates the learning between the LLM and feature encoder, alleviating the problems of oscillation and biased learning. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary regularization on the gradient to promote updating with larger step sizes, which potentially allows for a more accurate estimation of the proposed MultiModal Balance Coefficient and further improves the training sufficiency. Our proposed approach is agnostic to the architecture of LLM and feature encoder, so it can be generically integrated with various MLLMs. We conduct experiments on multiple downstream tasks with various MLLMs, demonstrating that the proposed method is more effective than the baselines in MLLM instruction tuning.

Abstract: Museums serve as repositories of cultural heritage and historical artifacts from diverse epochs, civilizations, and regions, preserving well-documented collections that encapsulate vast knowledge, which, when systematically structured into large-scale datasets, can train specialized models. Visitors engage with exhibits through curiosity and questions, making expert domain-specific models essential for interactive query resolution and gaining historical insights. Understanding exhibits from images requires analyzing visual features and linking them to historical knowledge to derive meaningful correlations. We facilitate such reasoning by (a) collecting and curating a large-scale dataset of 65M images and 200M question-answer pairs for exhibits from all around the world; (b) training large vision-language models (VLMs) on the collected dataset; (c) benchmarking their ability on five visual question answering tasks, specifically designed to reflect real-world inquiries and challenges observed in museum settings. The complete dataset is labeled by museum experts, ensuring the quality and the practical significance of the labels. We train two VLMs from different categories: BLIP with vision-language aligned embeddings, but lacking the expressive power of large language models, and the LLaVA model, a powerful instruction-tuned LLM enriched with vision-language reasoning capabilities. Through extensive experiments, we find that while both model types effectively answer visually grounded questions, large vision-language models excel in queries requiring deeper historical context and reasoning. We further demonstrate the necessity of fine-tuning models on large-scale domain-specific datasets by showing that our fine-tuned models significantly outperform current SOTA VLMs in answering questions related to specific attributes, highlighting their limitations in handling complex, nuanced queries.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering requires models to generate accurate answers by integrating visual and textual understanding. However, VQA models still struggle with hallucinations, producing convincing but incorrect answers, particularly in knowledge-driven and Out-of-Distribution scenarios. We introduce FilterRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that combines BLIP-VQA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ground answers in external knowledge sources like Wikipedia and DBpedia. FilterRAG achieves 36.5% accuracy on the OK-VQA dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving robustness in both in-domain and Out-of-Distribution settings. These findings highlight the potential of FilterRAG to improve Visual Question Answering systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational agents, particularly chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), poses a significant risk of social engineering (SE) attacks on social media platforms. SE detection in multi-turn, chat-based interactions is considerably more complex than single-instance detection due to the dynamic nature of these conversations. A critical factor in mitigating this threat is understanding the SE attack mechanisms through which SE attacks operate, specifically how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and how victims' personality traits contribute to their susceptibility. In this work, we propose an LLM-agentic framework, SE-VSim, to simulate SE attack mechanisms by generating multi-turn conversations. We model victim agents with varying personality traits to assess how psychological profiles influence susceptibility to manipulation. Using a dataset of over 1000 simulated conversations, we examine attack scenarios in which adversaries, posing as recruiters, funding agencies, and journalists, attempt to extract sensitive information. Based on this analysis, we present a proof of concept, SE-OmniGuard, to offer personalized protection to users by leveraging prior knowledge of the victims personality, evaluating attack strategies, and monitoring information exchanges in conversations to identify potential SE attempts.

<title>The Model Hears You: Audio Language Model Deployments Should Consider the Principle of Least Privilege</title>

Abstract: The latest Audio Language Models (Audio LMs) process speech directly instead of relying on a separate transcription step. This shift preserves detailed information, such as intonation or the presence of multiple speakers, that would otherwise be lost in transcription. However, it also introduces new safety risks, including the potential misuse of speaker identity cues and other sensitive vocal attributes, which could have legal implications. In this paper, we urge a closer examination of how these models are built and deployed. Our experiments show that end-to-end modeling, compared with cascaded pipelines, creates socio-technical safety risks such as identity inference, biased decision-making, and emotion detection. This raises concerns about whether Audio LMs store voiceprints and function in ways that create uncertainty under existing legal regimes. We then argue that the Principle of Least Privilege should be considered to guide the development and deployment of these models. Specifically, evaluations should assess (1) the privacy and safety risks associated with end-to-end modeling; and (2) the appropriate scope of information access. Finally, we highlight related gaps in current audio LM benchmarks and identify key open research questions, both technical and policy-related, that must be addressed to enable the responsible deployment of end-to-end Audio LMs.

Abstract: Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and $F_1$ score.

Abstract: This systematic review of the research literature on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a focused analysis of the most highly cited studies published between 2020 and May 2025. A total of 128 articles met our inclusion criteria. The records were retrieved from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP). RAG couples a neural retriever with a generative language model, grounding output in up-to-date, non-parametric memory while retaining the semantic generalisation stored in model weights. Guided by the PRISMA 2020 framework, we (i) specify explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria based on citation count and research questions, (ii) catalogue datasets, architectures, and evaluation practices, and (iii) synthesise empirical evidence on the effectiveness and limitations of RAG. To mitigate citation-lag bias, we applied a lower citation-count threshold to papers published in 2025 so that emerging breakthroughs with naturally fewer citations were still captured. This review clarifies the current research landscape, highlights methodological gaps, and charts priority directions for future research.

Abstract: The increasing demand for domain-specific evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous benchmarks. These efforts often adhere to the principle of data scaling, relying on large corpora or extensive question-answer (QA) sets to ensure broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and QA set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLM performance remains poorly understood. In this paper, we argue that data scaling is not always the optimal principle for domain-specific benchmark construction. Instead, we introduce Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework grounded in the principle of comprehensiveness and compactness. Comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall by covering the full breadth of the domain, while compactness improves precision by reducing redundancy and noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a case study conducted at a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of PolyBench, a large-scale, high-quality academic benchmark. Although this study focuses on academia, the Comp-Comp framework is domain-agnostic and readily adaptable to a wide range of specialized fields.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is widely used in automatic speech recognition. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach to dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and minimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose additional local constraints to ensure that the model optimizes each source of heterogeneous data to its local optimum after $K$-step gradient descent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization problem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We discuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning. Experiments are carried out on self-supervised pre-training using multi-domain and multilingual datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach can significantly improve the adaptivity of the self-supervised pre-trained model for the downstream supervised fine-tuning tasks.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Summary: 
Emotion Omni is a model designed to understand emotional content in user speech and generate empathetic responses. The model addresses the challenge of building empathetic speech assistants without the need for massive datasets or large-scale training. Emotion Omni outperforms existing models in speech quality and empathy, achieving a UTMOS score of 4.41 and an Emotion GPT Score of 3.97. The model's ability to follow instructions is comparable to models that require extensive pretraining. The development of a 200k emotional dialogue dataset supports the training and testing of empathetic speech assistants. Emotion Omni's improvements in speech fidelity and emotional expressiveness make it a promising advancement in human-machine interaction. Demos of the model can be accessed at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.18655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models only convert response content into speech without fully capturing the rich emotional cues in user queries, where the same sentence may convey different meanings depending on the expression. Emotional understanding is thus essential for improving human-machine interaction. Most empathetic speech LLMs rely on massive datasets, demanding high computational cost. A key challenge is to build models that generate empathetic responses with limited data and without large-scale training. To this end, we propose Emotion Omni, a model that understands emotional content in user speech and generates empathetic responses. We further developed a data pipeline to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset supporting empathetic speech assistants. Experiments show that Emotion Omni achieves comparable instruction-following ability without large-scale pretraining, while surpassing existing models in speech quality (UTMOS:4.41) and empathy (Emotion GPT Score: 3.97). These results confirm its improvements in both speech fidelity and emotional expressiveness. Demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/.

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which is gaining popularity due to the rapid development of prompt engineering driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents DistillPrompt -- a novel autoprompting method based on large language models that employs a multi-stage integration of task-specific information into prompts using training data. DistillPrompt utilizes distillation, compression, and aggregation operations to explore the prompt space more thoroughly. The method was tested on different datasets for text classification and generation tasks using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 language model. The results demonstrate a significant average improvement (e.g., 20.12% across the entire dataset compared to Grips) in key metrics over existing methods in the field, establishing DistillPrompt as one of the most effective non-gradient approaches in autoprompting.

<div> Dataset, Video Question Answering, Cognitive Understanding, Movie Content, Agentic Brainstorming
Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces the MovieCORE dataset, a unique video question answering (VQA) dataset that delves deeper into cognitive understanding of movie content. It focuses on prompting System-2 thinking through specific and thought-provoking questions. The dataset is created using an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, involving multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents. Cognitive tests assess the depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity of the questions. A comprehensive evaluation scheme is proposed to assess VQA model performance on more challenging cognitive tasks. An Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE) module is introduced to enhance model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. This work aims to advance AI systems' understanding of movies and sheds light on the strengths and limitations of current VQA models when faced with nuanced questions about cinematic content.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

Summary:
This study explores the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) to membership inference attacks (MIAs) that aim to uncover whether users' private information has been used in system prompts. Four types of attacks - direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks - were designed and tested on three LLMs and two benchmark datasets. Results indicate a realistic threat of MIAs on LLM RecSys, with direct inquiry and poisoning attacks being particularly effective. Factors such as the number of shots in system prompts and the victim's position in the shots influence the success of these attacks. This highlights the importance of considering privacy concerns in the development of LLM RecSys for safeguarding users' sensitive data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

Summary: 
Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) is a framework introduced in this paper for creating self-evolving agents that grow continuously through real-world interaction. The framework is based on four core principles: Experience Exploration, Long-term Memory, Skill Learning, and Knowledge Internalization. Agents learn through self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, preserve historical knowledge into a persistent memory system, abstract recurring patterns into reusable skills, and internalize explicit experiences into intuitive capabilities. The paper also presents StuLife, a benchmark dataset simulating a student's college journey with detailed scenarios. StuLife spans enrollment, academic, and personal development phases, providing a holistic view of a student's experience. This framework and benchmark dataset offer insights into developing agents capable of lifelong learning and adaptation.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm

Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary, uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Hallucinations, N-Gram frequency tensor, Tensor decomposition methods, MLP binary classifier<br />
Summary: <br />
Hallucinations remain a significant issue in Large Language Models (LLMs) despite their effectiveness in natural language tasks. Various methods like uncertainty estimation and consistency checks aim to address this problem. This work proposes a novel approach inspired by ROUGE, constructing an N-Gram frequency tensor from LLM-generated text to capture richer semantic structure. Tensor decomposition methods are used to extract features for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for hallucinations. The method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset, showing significant improvements over traditional baselines and competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics, such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

<div> Keywords: large language models, reasoning tasks, adaptive updates, dynamic fine-tuning, knowledge retention

Summary: 
SAGE is a framework designed to address the limitations of large language models in adapting and learning from new data during reasoning at inference time. The framework decomposes complex reasoning tasks into atomic subtasks and utilizes a Trigger module to detect reasoning failures in real-time. The Trigger Buffer module clusters anomaly samples for stability checks and merging, while the Lora Store module dynamically optimizes parameter updates for knowledge retention. Through dynamic knowledge updating during test time, SAGE demonstrates excellent accuracy, robustness, and stability on atomic reasoning subtasks. The approach allows for adaptive updates during reasoning at inference time, providing a more efficient and effective method for continuous learning in language models.

arXiv:2509.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN, followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The study explores multi-agent debate in AI reasoning, finding that diversity in model capabilities can lead to decreased accuracy over time. Existing research has focused on homogeneous agent groups, but this study demonstrates that stronger models may still lose accuracy when debating with weaker counterparts. Models often shift from correct to incorrect answers due to peer reasoning, choosing agreement over challenging flawed logic. This highlights the risk of performance degradation in debate when agents prioritize consensus over correct reasoning. The study suggests that naive applications of debate in AI systems may lead to harmful outcomes without proper incentivization or resistance to persuasive yet incorrect reasoning. <div>

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

Summary:
Token fertility ratios, token counts, and linguistic metadata can accurately predict translation quality without running the translation system. Using features such as language family, script, and region, ChrF scores for GPT-4o translations in 203 languages were forecasted. Gradient boosting models achieved $R^{2}$ values of 0.66 for XX$\rightarrow$English and 0.72 for English$\rightarrow$XX translations. Typological factors were found to be crucial for predictions into English, while token-level fertility played a larger role for translations into diverse languages. These results highlight the influence of both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology on translation quality, providing valuable insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy \textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

Summary: 
In the article, the authors focus on evaluating large-language models used as automatic raters for various tasks like document summarization, dialog generation, and story generation. Traditional methods for measuring model performance lack the ability to assign absolute scores to individual summaries, which is essential for thresholding purposes. The authors propose a direct-scoring method that utilizes synthetic summaries to create pairwise machine rankings at test time. Their method demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art pairwise evaluators on benchmark datasets like SummEval, TopicalChat, and HANNA.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of refining evaluation methods for large-language models and offers a promising approach for assessing their performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level} performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval (\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05}) meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as data to facilitate future work.

- A multi-stage LLM-based framework was developed to identify staff message topics and classify messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion.
- The best-performing LLM model achieved a high accuracy rate and weighted F1-score, making it effective for analyzing staff messages.

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and 76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

Tokenization inefficiency in morphologically complex and low-resource languages leads to increased computing resources and decreased accuracy in natural language processing. A study evaluated 10 large language models on a diverse dataset encompassing 16 African languages and found that higher fertility, or tokens per word, consistently correlated with lower accuracy across all models and subjects. Reasoning models outperformed non-reasoning models in both high and low resource languages, reducing accuracy disparities seen in previous models. The study also highlighted the significant impact of token inflation on training costs and time, with a doubling in tokens resulting in quadrupled expenses. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating morphologically aware tokenization, ensuring fair pricing, and developing multilingual benchmarks to promote more equitable natural language processing.

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word) reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models (DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable natural language processing (NLP).

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&amp;A) system based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed articles, curated Q&amp;A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1), show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized medical AI systems.

<div> Keywords: AI, language models, bidirectional reasoning, Contrastive Fine-Tuning, understanding

Summary: 
The research investigates whether large language models truly comprehend concepts or simply recognize patterns by introducing the concept of bidirectional reasoning. The ability to apply transformations in both directions without explicit training on the reverse direction is proposed as a test for genuine understanding. The study reveals cognitive specialization in current language models, where fine-tuning on forward tasks results in reduced bidirectional reasoning abilities. To address this, Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT) is introduced, which trains models using positive, negative, and obfuscation examples to develop deeper understanding. The experiments show that CFT successfully enables bidirectional reasoning, allowing for strong reverse performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. This approach not only serves as a theoretical framework for evaluating understanding in AI but also provides a practical training method for enhancing AI systems' capabilities.

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue, they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples. This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for developing more capable AI systems.

Summary:<br /><br />In a study of dyadic communication using the KiloGram dataset, researchers investigated how people establish referential conventions for new objects. They found that forming shared ways of describing objects involves broader conceptual alignment, leading to increased alignment in descriptions for undiscussed images. This alignment generalized to new referents and decayed nonlinearly with visual similarity, consistent with Shepard's law. The study showed that ad hoc conventions are not arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, highlighting implications for theories of reference and language agent design. <div>

An alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, small language models, reasoning tasks, Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation, task setting

Summary: 
Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD) addresses the issue of spurious correlations in small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on noisy CoT data from large language models (LLMs). CoPeD introduces a correctness-aware task setting that encourages SLMs to predict answers based on correct rationales and adjust predictions when incorrect. This improves reasoning faithfulness and enables the model to learn from mistakes. Additionally, a Correctness-Aware Weighted loss dynamically adjusts the contribution of training instances based on rationale and answer losses, focusing on samples where rationales provide stronger support for correct answers. Experimental results demonstrate CoPeD's effectiveness on both in-distribution (IND) and out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning datasets. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization. Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

<div> dataset construction, Large Language Models, preference alignment, efficient, regulation

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) require high-quality preference datasets to align with human preferences. Conventional methods face challenges like distribution mismatches and computational overhead. This work proposes Icon$^{2}$, a novel approach that leverages LLMs' representation space. It extracts direction vectors to encode preferences and filters self-synthesized instructions for consistency. Bidirectional inherent control guides token representations for precise response generation. Experimental results show significant improvements in alignment and efficiency, with Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieving average win rate improvements of 13.89% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard. Computational costs are also reduced by up to 48.1%. This innovative method addresses the challenges of constructing preference datasets for LLMs, leading to better alignment with human preferences and improved efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency. Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by up to 48.1%.

Abstract: The paradigm shift from traditional ranked-based search to Generative Search Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized answers. This paper introduces a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale, content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

<title>New Insights into Optimal Alignment of Acoustic and Linguistic Representations for Knowledge Transfer in ASR</title>

<div> Keywords: alignment, optimal transport, automatic speech recognition, linguistic knowledge transfer, detection <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is crucial for transferring linguistic knowledge to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The challenge lies in addressing the structured and asymmetric nature of the alignment process, where multiple acoustic frames may correspond to a single linguistic token (many-to-one) or vice versa (one-to-many). Additionally, handling imbalanced matching conditions due to noise or silence is essential. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to treat alignment as a detection problem, aiming to identify significant correspondences with high precision and recall. The unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment model efficiently addresses distributional mismatch and structural asymmetries, ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while allowing for flexible mappings between acoustic and linguistic units. Experimental results on a CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model validate the effectiveness of this approach in improving ASR performance by controlling the degree of matching. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric: while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR performance.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS) approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models (LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts, providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music information retrieval applications.

<div> Keywords: Intent detection, few-shot learning, conversational systems, relational structure, pretraining

Summary: 
SAID is a novel framework that combines textual and relational structure information for intent detection in conversational systems. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating both types of information in a unified manner. The proposed query-adaptive attention network (QueryAdapt) leverages intent-specific relation tokens generated from query-query and query-answer relations, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that SAID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in intent detection. The framework pretrains language models using large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora and fine-tunes with limited annotations, focusing on the textual and structural aspects of conversational systems. By explicitly capturing the query-query and query-answer relations, SAID enhances the accuracy of intent detection at the beginning of conversations. This research contributes to advancing the field of intent detection in conversational systems under challenging few-shot scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems, since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data, neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network (QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs, encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, method reuse, question similarity, solution transfer, cross-question reuse

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used to find solutions to various questions. Traditional approaches to method reuse require questions to be highly similar, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a method to extend method reuse to address questions with low similarity or hidden similarities. By separating the question and solution and guiding the LLM to adapt the solution to new but related questions, the focus shifts to solution transfer rather than question recognition. This approach is further extended to cases where questions share only partial features or hidden characteristics, enabling cross-question method reuse beyond conventional constraints. Experimental results confirm that the scope-extension approach increases the likelihood of filtering out reusable solutions, enhancing the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse. However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore, we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing English-centric bias in large language models. Built on Llama 3.1-8B and scaled to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens (82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2) creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and (4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive foundation models that integrate low-resource languages.

arXiv:2509.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result, it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances. Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

Summary: 
Farsi, with over 127 million speakers, is considered a middle-resource language, but faces challenges in data availability for subjective tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection. Despite a growing digital text availability, datasets lack quality and essential demographic factors, hindering accurate modeling of language subjectivity. The review of 110 publications highlights the scarcity of publicly available datasets in Farsi. Existing datasets show instability in prediction models' results, indicating the insufficiency of data volume in improving NLP prospects for the language. The study emphasizes the need for more comprehensive datasets with demographic factors for better modeling of subjectivity in Farsi.

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection) and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore, existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects in NLP.

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and domains.

Abstract: This research introduces VeriFact-CoT (Verified Factual Chain-of-Thought), a novel method designed to address the pervasive issues of hallucination and the absence of credible citation sources in Large Language Models (LLMs) when generating complex, fact-sensitive content. By incorporating a multi-stage mechanism of 'fact verification-reflection-citation integration,' VeriFact-CoT empowers LLMs to critically self-examine and revise their intermediate reasoning steps and final answers. This process significantly enhances the objective accuracy, trustworthiness, and traceability of the generated outputs, making LLMs more reliable for applications demanding high fidelity such as scientific research, news reporting, and legal consultation.

Summary:
LatinX is a multilingual text-to-speech model designed for speech-to-speech translation that maintains the original speaker's identity across different languages. The model, a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer, undergoes three stages of training: pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, supervised fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and alignment with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity. Trained on English and Romance languages, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER and enhances speaker similarity compared to the baseline. Human evaluations confirm stronger perceived speaker similarity with LatinX, highlighting differences between objective and subjective assessments. The study also discusses cross-lingual analyses and suggests exploring balanced preference signals and lower-latency architectures for future improvements.

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference signals and lower-latency architectures as future work.

<div> Keywords: Traditional Chinese Medicine, Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Large Language Models, explainable formula generation, ZhiFangDanTai<br />
<br />
Summary: 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas are crucial for treating complex diseases, but existing models lack comprehensive results. This paper introduces ZhiFangDanTai, a framework that combines Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai retrieves and synthesizes structured TCM knowledge to provide concise summaries, enhancing LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved information. The framework addresses challenges such as formula compositions, roles of sovereign, minister, assistant, courier, efficacy, contraindications, and diagnosis details. The theoretical proofs show that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques reduces generalization error and hallucination rates in TCM formula tasks. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of ZhiFangDanTai over existing models. The model is openly available at https://huggingface.co/tczzx6/ZhiFangDanTai1.0. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy; contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/tczzx6/ZhiFangDanTai1.0.

Summary:
MedFactEval is introduced as a framework for scalable evaluation of factual accuracy in clinical text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). It involves clinicians defining key facts and an LLM Jury assessing their inclusion in summaries. MedAgentBrief is a model-agnostic workflow designed for generating high-quality, factual discharge summaries. Validation was done using a gold-standard reference set by a physician panel, showing almost perfect agreement with the LLM Jury. The framework's performance was statistically non-inferior to a single human expert. This work aims to advance the responsible use of generative AI in clinical workflows. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert (kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework (MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief), offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of generative AI in clinical workflows.

Summary:<br />
This study investigates the effectiveness of alignment methods on Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as collaborators in multiturn, multiparty interactions. The research showcases how friction agents, designed to prompt groups to reflect and deliberate during decision-making, perform in collaborative task conversations. A novel evaluation framework is proposed to measure the impact of friction interventions on group collaboration and belief alignment. Results demonstrate that a friction-aware approach surpasses common alignment techniques, facilitating convergence towards a common ground and enhancing task outcome correctness. The study emphasizes the importance of training AI collaborators for long-horizon interactions, highlighting the significance of friction-aware strategies in improving the reliability and predictability of LLM agents in diverse workflows. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and correctness of task outcomes.

<title>Enhancing the Robustness of Contextual ASR to Varying Biasing Information Volumes Through Purified Semantic Correlation Joint Modeling</title>

<div> Keywords: cross-attention, contextual ASR, biasing information, semantic correlation, PSC-Joint

Summary: 
The study focuses on enhancing contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models by addressing the challenges posed by variations in biasing information volume. The proposed purified semantic correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach identifies and integrates the most relevant biasing information, rather than the entire biasing list, to improve recognition accuracy. By calculating semantic correlations at different levels and filtering out irrelevant biasing phrases, the PSC-Joint approach effectively highlights and integrates key information for contextual recognition. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in F1 score on datasets with varying biasing list lengths, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating the impact of information variations. The study highlights the importance of semantic correlations and purification mechanisms for optimizing contextual ASR models in handling personalized biasing phrases. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level, phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46% on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

Summary:<br />
- The dissertation addresses the challenge of high computational costs in deploying large language models by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures.
- It focuses on resolving the conflict between reducing computation using dynamism and avoiding system-level bottlenecks in batched inference.
- The work proposes an efficient parallel decoding mechanism to address overhead in conventional early-exiting methods.
- Deep parameter sharing is introduced as an architectural foundation to create compact, parameter-efficient models that mitigate synchronization issues in dynamic inference.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs, they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a single model.

Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance but struggle with producing hallucinations, affecting reliability. The TruthfulQA benchmark assesses truthfulness but is mainly available in English, creating a gap for evaluating LLMs in low-resource languages. KatotohananQA, a Filipino translation of TruthfulQA, was introduced and used to evaluate seven free-tier proprietary models through a binary-choice framework. The study revealed a significant truthfulness performance gap between English and Filipino, with newer OpenAI models displaying strong multilingual robustness. Variances in question characteristics were also identified, indicating that certain question types, categories, and topics may be less robust to multilingual transfer. These findings emphasize the importance of broader multilingual evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in the usage of LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

To address this, we present KatotohananQA, a Filipino translation of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Seven free-tier proprietary models were assessed using a binary-choice framework. Findings show a significant performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness, with newer OpenAI models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) demonstrating strong multilingual robustness. Results also reveal disparities across question characteristics, suggesting that some question types, categories, and topics are less robust to multilingual transfer which highlight the need for broader multilingual evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage.

<div> Keywords: Conversational Speech Synthesis, Multimodal Dialogue History, Fine-grained Interaction Modeling, Prosody, Interaction Graphs

Summary:
Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate natural prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH) at a fine-grained level. The proposed MFCIG-CSS system utilizes two specialized interaction graphs, semantic and prosody, to capture interactions between word-level semantics and prosody in MDH. By encoding these interactions, the system enhances synthesized speech with natural conversational prosody, leading to superior prosodic expressiveness compared to baseline models. The approach is evaluated on the DailyTalk dataset and demonstrates significant improvements in prosody generation. The code and speech samples of MFCIG-CSS are available on GitHub at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MFCIG-CSS.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) often face catastrophic forgetting in sequential multi-task scenarios. While methods like O-LoRA and N-LoRA address task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace orthogonality, additive fine-tuning disrupts the natural geometric structure of LLM parameters, limiting performance. Recognizing the inherent geometric structure of the parameter space in LLMs, the Orthogonal Low-rank Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA) method introduces Lie group theory to LLM fine-tuning. OLieRA leverages multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry while imposing orthogonality constraints on task subspaces. Experimental results highlight that OLieRA achieves top-tier performance on the Standard CL benchmark and remains competitive in the Large Number of Tasks setting. <br /><br />Summary: Large language models encounter challenges with catastrophic forgetting in multi-task settings. While existing methods like O-LoRA and N-LoRA address task interference through orthogonality constraints, they neglect the vital geometric structure of LLM parameters. Introducing Lie group theory, the OLieRA method ensures geometric preservation alongside orthogonality enforcement, leading to superior performance in various benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2509.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters, limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of Tasks setting.

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age, country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

Summary:
The study explores the impact of synthetic data on general-purpose text embedders. The researchers reproduced and released high-quality synthetic data, leading to consistent performance improvements. However, they found that the benefits of synthetic data are limited and specific to individual datasets, with trade-offs between performance on different tasks. Training on synthetic data does not necessarily result in more robust embedding models across tasks. This highlights the current limitations of using synthetic data for general-purpose embedders and questions the belief that it leads to overall improvements in model generalization. <div>
arXiv:2509.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data. Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al. (Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another. Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

The proposed framework addresses the limitations of generic LLMs by creating a synthetic dataset that uses a standardized JSON format. This helps ensure consistency and scalability. In addition to the synthetic data set, the resumes were parsed using DeepSeek, a high-parameter LLM. The resumes were parsed into the same structured JSON format and placed in the training set. This will help improve data diversity and realism. Through experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance metrics, such as exact match, F1 score, BLEU score, ROUGE score, and overall similarity compared to base models and other state-of-the-art LLMs. In particular, the fine-tuned Phi-4 model achieved the highest F1 score of 90.62%, indicating exceptional precision and recall in recruitment tasks. This study highlights the potential of fine-tuned LLMs. Furthermore, it will revolutionize recruitment workflows by providing more accurate candidate-job matching.

<div> Mask-GCG, Large Language Models, Jailbreak attacks, Greedy Coordinate Gradient, Token masking <br />
<br />
Summary: In response to successful jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), a new method called Mask-GCG is proposed. This method utilizes learnable token masking to identify and prioritize impactful tokens in the suffix during attacks, reducing redundancy and computational overhead. By increasing the focus on high-impact tokens and pruning low-impact ones, Mask-GCG effectively shortens the time needed for successful attacks compared to previous methods like GCG. Experimental results demonstrate that most tokens in the suffix play a significant role in the success of attacks, highlighting token redundancy in LLM prompts. This approach not only maintains attack success rates but also provides insights for creating efficient and interpretable LLMs in the context of security vulnerabilities like jailbreak attacks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix. Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts. Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

arXiv:2509.06356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks. Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and dataset are provided in the appendix.

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics, LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages. These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual commonsense generation. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/gplsi/MULTICOM.

arXiv:2509.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative, long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100 tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES. Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

<div> Keywords: Transformer-based language models, Layer-Wise Scaling (LWS), pruning, pre-training, computational capacity

Summary:<br /><br />
This study introduces three new Layer-Wise Scaling (LWS) variants for Transformer-based language models, which redistribute FFN widths and attention heads through linear interpolation during pre-training. By systematically ablating these variants on a fixed budget of parameters and training on 5 billion tokens, the models achieve better performance compared to traditional isotropic layer sizes without compromising training throughput. The research is a significant exploration into the potential of layer-wise architectures for pre-training, but it calls for further experiments on a larger scale to fully understand their impact. This work highlights the importance of considering the diverse functional roles of different depths in Transformer models and suggests that optimizing layer sizes can lead to improved model performance. <div>
arXiv:2509.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling (LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed, Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline, without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance. Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated baselines.

Summary:
SLiNT is a new framework designed to address the challenges of link prediction in knowledge graphs by integrating structural information and semantic context. It involves three key components: Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) to enrich sparse entities, Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning (DHCL) for fine-grained supervision, and Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) for structure-aware intervention. Experimental results on WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets show that SLiNT outperforms both embedding-based and generation-based baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning in scalable knowledge graph completion. This approach combines the strengths of large language models with knowledge graph-derived structural context for robust link prediction. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically, Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for scalable knowledge graph completion.

<div> gate, calibration, large language models, hallucinations, attention

Summary:
This article introduces a decoding framework called HAVE that addresses issues of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). HAVE incorporates head-adaptive gating, which reweighs attention heads, and value calibration to align attention with token contributions. The framework reduces hallucinations by creating token-level evidence aligned with model updates and fusing it with LM distribution through an uncertainty-scaled policy. HAVE is parameter-free, efficient, and can be easily integrated with LLMs without finetuning. Experimental results on multiple QA benchmarks and LLM families show that HAVE outperforms strong baselines and reduces hallucinations. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and improves trustworthiness in real-world generation tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together, these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass, making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world settings.

By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates, and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

Intertextuality, the connection between literary texts through references, is a fundamental concept in literary studies. This paper introduces a new quantitative model for analyzing intertextuality, which involves comparing embeddings of n-grams from two texts and averaging the results. The method is validated on texts with known intertextual relationships and tested for scalability on a large set of diverse texts, proving its effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis applied to the results reveals centrality and community structures, providing insights into the intertextual relationships captured by the model. This new approach offers a scalable and quantitative way to analyze intertextuality in literary texts, allowing for a deeper understanding of the connections between works.

Abstract: Intertextuality is a central tenet in literary studies. It refers to the intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts, demonstrates the method's effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis further reveals centrality and community structures, affirming the approach's success in capturing and quantifying intertextual relationships.

<title>Domain-Aware RAG: MoL-Enhanced RL for Efficient Training and Scalable Retrieval</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge. While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting, still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus (TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations, allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters) fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Abstract: We introduce ParCzech4Speech 1.0, a processed version of the ParCzech 4.0 corpus, targeted at speech modeling tasks with the largest variant containing 2,695 hours. We combined the sound recordings of the Czech parliamentary speeches with the official transcripts. The recordings were processed with WhisperX and Wav2Vec 2.0 to extract automated audio-text alignment. Our processing pipeline improves upon the ParCzech 3.0 speech recognition version by extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is offered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis tasks with clean boundaries, (2) unsegmented preserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment for further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain the original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The dataset is available in the LINDAT repository, with the sentence-segmented and unsegmented variants additionally available on Hugging Face.

<title>Will Annotators Disagree? Identifying Subjectivity in Value-Laden Arguments</title>

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a more nuanced annotation process.

<title>Anchoring Refusal Direction: Mitigating Safety Risks in Tuning via Projection Constraint</title>

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions, raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states, which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training, which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios, and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance. Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety research.

<title>MachineLearningLM: Continued Pretraining Language Models on Millions of Synthetic Tabular Prediction Tasks Scales In-Context ML</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06806</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.

<title>MoGU V2: Toward a Higher Pareto Frontier Between Model Usability and Security</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06807</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative, rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

arXiv:2509.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection, and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code and data publicly available.

<title>A Comparative Benchmark of Large Language Models for Labelling Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs</title>

arXiv:2509.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) is critical to reducing the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured, free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy, identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&amp;M data quality and downstream reliability analysis.

<title>COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies. However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects: truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore, our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/Rezamirbagheri110/EPT-Benchmark.

<title>The Majority is not always right: RL training for solution aggregation</title>

arXiv:2509.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile, and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers. Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

However, we observe that higher-quality claims can sometimes be extracted using other methods, even when their METEOR scores are lower.

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700 low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and low-resource languages.

<title>Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN): A Protocol for Trustworthy Numeric Answers from LLMs via Claim Verification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06902</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}. Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity: fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose \textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality, rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic, integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings: \emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates uncertainty.

<title>Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

<title>On the Same Wavelength? Evaluating Pragmatic Reasoning in Language Models across Broad Concepts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06952</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting, and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim, social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to (a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

<title>ProtSAE: Disentangling and Interpreting Protein Language Models via Semantically-Guided Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs for downstream generation tasks.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber incidents presents significant challenges for digital forensic investigators, especially in evidence collection and analysis. Public resources are still limited because of ethical, legal, and privacy concerns, even though realistic datasets are necessary to support research and tool developments. To address this gap, we introduce ForensicsData, an extensive Question-Context-Answer (Q-C-A) dataset sourced from actual malware analysis reports. It consists of more than 5,000 Q-C-A triplets. A unique workflow was used to create the dataset, which extracts structured data, uses large language models (LLMs) to transform it into Q-C-A format, and then uses a specialized evaluation process to confirm its quality. Among the models evaluated, Gemini 2 Flash demonstrated the best performance in aligning generated content with forensic terminology. ForensicsData aims to advance digital forensics by enabling reproducible experiments and fostering collaboration within the research community.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper, we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format Box 1.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94, significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline, while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.

Abstract: Although paralinguistic cues are often considered the primary drivers of speech emotion recognition (SER), we investigate the role of lexical content extracted from speech and show that it can achieve competitive and in some cases higher performance compared to acoustic models. On the MELD dataset, our lexical-based approach obtains a weighted F1-score (WF1) of 51.5%, compared to 49.3% for an acoustic-only pipeline with a larger parameter count. Furthermore, we analyze different self-supervised (SSL) speech and text representations, conduct a layer-wise study of transformer-based encoders, and evaluate the effect of audio denoising.

<title>Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

<title>TSPC: A Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric Architecture for code-switching Vietnamese-English Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.

Abstract: Chemical and materials research has traditionally relied heavily on knowledge narrative, with progress often driven by language-based descriptions of principles, mechanisms, and experimental experiences, rather than tables, limiting what conventional databases and ML can exploit. We present a language-native database for boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer thermally conductive composites that captures lightly structured information from papers across preparation, characterization, theory-computation, and mechanistic reasoning, with evidence-linked snippets. Records are organized in a heterogeneous database and queried via composite retrieval with semantics, key words and value filters. The system can synthesizes literature into accurate, verifiable, and expert style guidance. This substrate enables high fidelity efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool augmented agents to interleave retrieval with reasoning and deliver actionable SOP. The framework supplies the language rich foundation required for LLM-driven materials discovery.

<title>Reverse-Engineered Reasoning for Open-Ended Generation</title>

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works ``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent, step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks. Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery, we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints, allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency, producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user experience.

Abstract: Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages. This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.

Abstract: We present Beamforming-LLM, a system that enables users to semantically recall conversations they may have missed in multi-speaker environments. The system combines spatial audio capture using a microphone array with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to support natural language queries such as, "What did I miss when I was following the conversation on dogs?" Directional audio streams are separated using beamforming, transcribed with Whisper, and embedded into a vector database using sentence encoders. Upon receiving a user query, semantically relevant segments are retrieved, temporally aligned with non-attended segments, and summarized using a lightweight large language model (GPT-4o-mini). The result is a user-friendly interface that provides contrastive summaries, spatial context, and timestamped audio playback. This work lays the foundation for intelligent auditory memory systems and has broad applications in assistive technology, meeting summarization, and context-aware personal spatial computing.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research, especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models. Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more insights into our methodologies.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents, requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes, and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&amp;When dataset, a benchmark designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure. RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data are available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.

Abstract: Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision, recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

<title>Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL, which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation, where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and (ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration, which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of multi-domain translation, where the objective is to learn mappings between arbitrary configurations of domains within a defined set (such as $(D_1, D_2)\rightarrow{}D_3$, $D_2\rightarrow{}(D_1, D_3)$, $D_3\rightarrow{}D_1$, etc. for three domains) without the need for separate models for each specific translation configuration, enabling more efficient and flexible domain translation. We introduce Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a method with dual purposes: i) reconstructing any missing views for new data objects, and ii) enabling learning in semi-supervised contexts with arbitrary supervision configurations. MDD achieves these objectives by exploiting the noise formulation of diffusion models, specifically modeling one noise level per domain. Similar to existing domain translation approaches, MDD learns the translation between any combination of domains. However, unlike prior work, our formulation inherently handles semi-supervised learning without modification by representing missing views as noise in the diffusion process. We evaluate our approach through domain translation experiments on BL3NDT, a multi-domain synthetic dataset designed for challenging semantic domain inversion, the BraTS2020 dataset, and the CelebAMask-HQ dataset.

<title>Support or Refute: Analyzing the Stance of Evidence to Detect Out-of-Context Mis- and Disinformation</title>

Abstract: Mis- and disinformation online have become a major societal problem as major sources of online harms of different kinds. One common form of mis- and disinformation is out-of-context (OOC) information, where different pieces of information are falsely associated, e.g., a real image combined with a false textual caption or a misleading textual description. Although some past studies have attempted to defend against OOC mis- and disinformation through external evidence, they tend to disregard the role of different pieces of evidence with different stances. Motivated by the intuition that the stance of evidence represents a bias towards different detection results, we propose a stance extraction network (SEN) that can extract the stances of different pieces of multi-modal evidence in a unified framework. Moreover, we introduce a support-refutation score calculated based on the co-occurrence relations of named entities into the textual SEN. Extensive experiments on a public large-scale dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines, with the best model achieving a performance gain of 3.2% in accuracy. The source code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/yx3266/SEN.

<title>Grammaticality illusion or ambiguous interpretation? Event-related potentials reveal the nature of the missing-NP effect in Mandarin centre-embedded structures</title>

Abstract: In several languages, omitting a verb phrase (VP) in double centre-embedded structures creates a grammaticality illusion. Similar illusion also exhibited in Mandarin missing-NP double centre-embedded structures. However, there is no consensus on its very nature. Instead of treating it as grammaticality illusion, we argue that ambiguous interpretations of verbs can best account for this phenomenon in Mandarin. To further support this hypothesis, we conducted two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments on quasi double centre-embedded structures whose complexity is reduced by placing the self-embedding relative clauses into the sentence's subject position. Experiment 1 showed that similar phenomenon even exhibited in this structure, evidenced by an absence of P600 effect and a presence of N400 effect. In Experiment 2, providing semantic cues to reduce ambiguity dispelled this illusion, as evidenced by a P600 effect. We interpret the results under garden-path theory and propose that word-order difference may account for this cross-linguistic variation.

Abstract: Bidirectional models are considered essential for strong text embeddings. Recent approaches to adapt autoregressive language models (LMs) into strong text embedding models have largely had the requirement to modify the LM architecture to be bidirectional. We challenge this premise by introducing "echo embeddings" which converts autoregressive LMs into high quality text embedding models without changing the architecture or requiring fine-tuning. By repeating the input and extracting embeddings from the repeated tokens -- which have access to all original tokens -- echo embeddings improve over classical LM embeddings by over 5% in zero-shot settings. Our zero-shot embeddings nearly match those obtained by bidirectionally-converted LMs that undergo additional masked-language modeling training. Echo embeddings are also compatible with supervised fine-tuning, matching or outperforming bidirectionally-converted LMs in an apples-to-apples comparison, even with an identical compute budget during training and inference. Overall, repetition is a simple and effective strategy to circumvent the need for bidirectional attention in embedding models, paving the way towards a unified architecture for all NLP tasks.

<title>Linearly Controlled Language Generation with Performative Guarantees</title>

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LMs) in critical applications highlights the need for controlled language generation strategies that are not only computationally efficient but that also enjoy performance guarantees. To achieve this, we use a common model of concept semantics as linearly represented in an LM's latent space. In particular, we take the view that natural language generation traces a trajectory in this continuous semantic space, realized by the language model's hidden activations. This view permits a control-theoretic treatment of text generation in latent space, in which we propose a lightweight, gradient-free intervention that dynamically steers trajectories away from regions corresponding to undesired meanings. In particular, we propose to directly intervene the activations of the token that is being generated in embedding space in an online fashion. Crucially, we do not simply steer activations towards a desirable region. Instead, our method relies on classical techniques from control theory to precisely control activations in a context-dependent way, and guarantees that they are brought into a specific pre-defined region of embedding space that corresponds to allowed semantics. Our intervention is computed in closed-form according to an optimal controller formulation, minimally impacting generation time. This control of the activations in embedding space allows for fine-grained steering of attributes of the generated sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different objectives-- toxicity avoidance and sentiment control-- while maintaining text quality.

Abstract: Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) play a crucial role in health outcomes and are frequently documented in clinical text. Automatically extracting SBDH information from clinical text relies on publicly available good-quality datasets. However, existing SBDH datasets exhibit substantial limitations in their availability and coverage. In this study, we introduce Synth-SBDH, a novel synthetic dataset with detailed SBDH annotations, encompassing status, temporal information, and rationale across 15 SBDH categories. We showcase the utility of Synth-SBDH on three tasks using real-world clinical datasets from two distinct hospital settings, highlighting its versatility, generalizability, and distillation capabilities. Models trained on Synth-SBDH consistently outperform counterparts with no Synth-SBDH training, achieving up to 63.75% macro-F improvements. Additionally, Synth-SBDH proves effective for rare SBDH categories and under-resource constraints while being substantially cheaper than expert-annotated real-world data. Human evaluation reveals a 71.06% Human-LLM alignment and uncovers areas for future refinements.

Abstract: Beyond individual languages, multilingual natural language processing (NLP) research increasingly aims to develop models that perform well across languages generally. However, evaluating these systems on all the world's languages is practically infeasible. To attain generalizability, representative language sampling is essential. Previous work argues that generalizable multilingual evaluation sets should contain languages with diverse typological properties. However, 'typologically diverse' language samples have been found to vary considerably in this regard, and popular sampling methods are flawed and inconsistent. We present a language sampling framework for selecting highly typologically diverse languages given a sampling frame, informed by language typology. We compare sampling methods with a range of metrics and find that our systematic methods consistently retrieve more typologically diverse language selections than previous methods in NLP. Moreover, we provide evidence that this affects generalizability in multilingual model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of diverse language sampling in NLP evaluation.

<title>Affective Computing in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey from the NLP Perspective</title>

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) integrates computer science, psychology, and cognitive science to enable machines to recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions across domains such as social media, finance, healthcare, and education. AC commonly centers on two task families: Affective Understanding (AU) and Affective Generation (AG). While fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved solid AU performance, they often generalize poorly across tasks and remain limited for AG, especially in producing diverse, emotionally appropriate responses. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT and LLaMA) has catalyzed a paradigm shift by offering in-context learning, broader world knowledge, and stronger sequence generation. This survey presents an NLP-oriented overview of AC in the LLM era. We (i) consolidate traditional AC tasks and preliminary LLM-based studies; (ii) review adaptation techniques that improve AU/AG, including Instruction Tuning (full and parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, P-/Prompt-Tuning), Prompt Engineering (zero/few-shot, chain-of-thought, agent-based prompting), and Reinforcement Learning. For the latter, we summarize RL from human preferences (RLHF), verifiable/programmatic rewards (RLVR), and AI feedback (RLAIF), which provide preference- or rule-grounded optimization signals that can help steer AU/AG toward empathy, safety, and planning, achieving finer-grained or multi-objective control. To assess progress, we compile benchmarks and evaluation practices for both AU and AG. We also discuss open challenges-from ethics, data quality, and safety to robust evaluation and resource efficiency-and outline research directions. We hope this survey clarifies the landscape and offers practical guidance for building affect-aware, reliable, and responsible LLM systems.

Abstract: Improving the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with respect to the cultural values that they encode has become an increasingly important topic. In this work, we study whether we can exploit existing knowledge about cultural values at inference time to adjust model responses to cultural value probes. We present a simple and inexpensive method that uses a combination of in-context learning (ICL) and human survey data, and show that we can improve the alignment to cultural values across 5 models that include both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Importantly, we show that our method could prove useful in test languages other than English and can improve alignment to the cultural values that correspond to a range of culturally diverse countries.

Abstract: While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in household environments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found on shop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there. ``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assembly lines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to make changes, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs. To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).

<title>Extracting and Combining Abilities For Building Multi-lingual Ability-enhanced Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multi-lingual ability transfer has become increasingly important for the broad application of large language models (LLMs). Existing work highly relies on training with the multi-lingual ability-related data, which may not be available for low-resource languages. To solve it, we propose a Multi-lingual Abilities Extraction and Combination approach, named as MAEC. Our key idea is to decompose and extract language-agnostic ability-related weights from LLMs, and combine them across different languages by simple addition and subtraction operations without training. Specifically, our MAEC consists of the extraction and combination stages. In the extraction stage, we firstly locate key neurons that are highly related to specific abilities, and then employ them to extract the transferable ability-related weights. In the combination stage, we further select the ability-related tensors that mitigate the linguistic effects, and design a combining strategy based on them and the language-specific weights, to build the multi-lingual ability-enhanced LLM. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on LLaMA-3 8B on mathematical and scientific tasks in both high-resource and low-resource lingual scenarios. Experiment results have shown that MAEC can effectively and efficiently extract and combine the advanced abilities, achieving comparable performance with PaLM. Resources are available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/MAET.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles are tested in simulation before deployment, using domain-specific programs for scenario specification. To aid the testing of autonomous vehicles in simulation, we design a natural language interface, using an instruction-following large language model, to assist a non-coding domain expert in synthesising the desired scenarios and vehicle behaviours. We show that using it to convert utterances to the symbolic program is feasible, despite the very small training dataset. Human experiments show that dialogue is critical to successful simulation generation, leading to a 4.5 times higher success rate than a generation without engaging in extended conversation.

Abstract: We propose a training-free approach to improve sentence embeddings leveraging test-time compute by applying generative text models for data augmentation at inference time. Unlike conventional data augmentation that utilises synthetic training data, our approach does not require access to model parameters or the computational resources typically required for fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. Generatively Augmented Sentence Encoding variates the input text by paraphrasing, summarising, or extracting keywords, followed by pooling the original and synthetic embeddings. Experimental results on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) demonstrate performance improvements across a range of embedding models using different generative models for augmentation. We find that generative augmentation leads to larger performance improvements for embedding models with lower baseline performance. These findings suggest that integrating generative augmentation at inference time adds semantic diversity and can enhance the robustness and generalisability of sentence embeddings for embedding models. Our results show that performance gains depend on the embedding model and the dataset.

Abstract: This paper sheds light on the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by rigorously evaluating their ability to process masked text. We introduce two novel tasks: MskQA, measuring reasoning on masked question-answering datasets like RealtimeQA, and MskCal, assessing numerical reasoning on masked arithmetic problems.Testing GPT-4o and 4o-mini reveals that while LLMs exhibit some resilience to masked text, their performance is highly contingent on masking rates and semantic cues. Specifically, "solid masking," where semantic clues are entirely absent, leads to a significant performance drop compared to "partial lifting," where some semantic information is retained, indicating LLMs' reliance on surface-level patterns. Interestingly, GPT-4o consistently outperforms 4o-mini, particularly in MskCal, demonstrating a greater ability to handle numerical reasoning with masked text. This underscores the crucial role of semantic cues in the reasoning process of LLMs. Our study illuminates the interplay between background knowledge and reasoning ability in masked text processing, paving the way for a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations, and highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods to accurately assess their true comprehension abilities.

Abstract: Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems assist users in completing tasks through natural language interactions, often relying on a single-layered workflow structure for slot-filling in public tasks, such as hotel bookings. However, in enterprise environments, which involve rich domain-specific knowledge, TOD systems face challenges due to task complexity and the lack of standardized documentation. In this work, we introduce HierTOD, an enterprise TOD system driven by hierarchical goals that can support composite workflows. By focusing on goal-driven interactions, our system serves a more proactive role, facilitating mixed-initiative dialogue and improving task completion. Equipped with components for natural language understanding, composite goal retriever, dialogue management, and response generation, backed by a well-organized data service with domain knowledge base and retrieval engine, HierTOD delivers efficient task assistance as judged by human evaluators. Furthermore, our system implementation unifies two TOD paradigms: slot-filling for information collection and step-by-step guidance for task execution. Our user study demonstrates the effectiveness and helpfulness of HierTOD in performing both paradigms.

Abstract: Large language models can use chain-of-thought (CoT) to externalize reasoning, potentially enabling oversight of capable LLM agents. Prior work has shown that models struggle at two-hop question-answering without CoT. This capability is so basic that if it was a fundamental limitation, it would imply that many complex agentic tasks would similarly require CoT. We investigate LLM latent reasoning capabilities using two-hop question answering as a case study. Previous work on the gap between latent and externalized two-hop reasoning produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results. In this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop reasoning in LLMs, where a positive result provides definitive evidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B and GPT-4o) on synthetic facts and test two-hop reasoning over these facts. By using synthetic facts, we rule out memorization and reasoning shortcuts as explanations for two-hop performance. We observe a nuanced picture: Models fail to compose two synthetic facts, but can succeed when one fact is synthetic and the other is natural. These results demonstrate that LLMs are undeniably capable of latent two-hop reasoning, although it remains unclear how this ability scales with model size. Finally, we highlight a lesson for researchers studying LLM reasoning: when drawing conclusions about LLM latent reasoning, one must be careful to avoid both spurious successes (that stem from memorization and reasoning shortcuts) and spurious failures (that may stem from artificial experimental setups, divorced from training setups of frontier LLMs).

Abstract: The exponential growth of online textual content across diverse domains has necessitated advanced methods for automated text classification. Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have shown significant success in this area, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, general-purpose LLMs often struggle with domain-specific content, such as scientific texts, due to unique challenges like specialized vocabulary and imbalanced data. In this study, we fine-tune four state-of-the-art LLMs BERT, SciBERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT on three datasets derived from the WoS-46985 dataset to evaluate their performance in scientific text classification. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific models, particularly SciBERT, consistently outperform general-purpose models in both abstract-based and keyword-based classification tasks. Additionally, we compare our achieved results with those reported in the literature for deep learning models, further highlighting the advantages of LLMs, especially when utilized in specific domains. The findings emphasize the importance of domain-specific adaptations for LLMs to enhance their effectiveness in specialized text classification tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the incremental, internal problem-solving process of language models (LMs) with arithmetic multi-hop reasoning as a case study. We specifically investigate when LMs internally resolve sub/whole problems through first reading the problem statements, generating reasoning chains, and achieving the final answer to mechanistically interpret LMs' multi-hop problem-solving process. Our experiments reveal a systematic incremental reasoning strategy underlying LMs. They have not derived an answer at the moment they first read the problem; instead, they obtain (sub)answers while generating the reasoning chain. Therefore, the generated reasoning chains can be regarded as faithful reflections of the model's internal computation.

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Large Language Models (CB-LLMs), a novel framework for building inherently interpretable Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to traditional black-box LLMs that rely on limited post-hoc interpretations, CB-LLMs integrate intrinsic interpretability directly into the LLMs -- allowing accurate explanations with scalability and transparency. We build CB-LLMs for two essential NLP tasks: text classification and text generation. In text classification, CB-LLMs is competitive with, and at times outperforms, traditional black-box models while providing explicit and interpretable reasoning. For the more challenging task of text generation, interpretable neurons in CB-LLMs enable precise concept detection, controlled generation, and safer outputs. The embedded interpretability empowers users to transparently identify harmful content, steer model behavior, and unlearn undesired concepts -- significantly enhancing the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLMs, which are critical capabilities notably absent in existing models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/CB-LLMs.

Abstract: Process-supervised reward models (PRMs) excel at providing step-by-step verification for large language model (LLM) outputs in domains like mathematics and coding. However, their application to fields lacking ground-truth answers, such as clinical note generation, poses significant challenges. We introduce a novel framework for training PRMs to deliver step-level reward signals for LLM-generated clinical notes. By precisely defining meaningful "steps," injecting realistic "errors" informed by domain expertise, and leveraging LLMs to generate process supervision data at scale, we overcome previous limitations. Our PRM, built on LLaMA-3.1 8B, consistently outperforms proprietary reasoning and non-reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two key evaluations: (1) distinguishing gold-standard from error-containing samples with 98.8% accuracy, and (2) selecting physician-preferred clinical notes with 56.2% accuracy. We investigate critical components for effective PRM training, including optimal loss functions and data selection strategies, and present a comprehensive physician reader study identifying predictors of downstream Best-of-N performance. Our study sheds light on unlocking the potential of PRMs for diverse generative tasks across domains.

Particularly, we tried three approaches: (i) native sample mixing, (ii) multi-task learning (MTL), and (iii) prompting and instruction finetuning very large multilingual language models (VMLMs). In native sample mixing, we added monolingual task samples to code-mixed training sets. In MTL learning, we relied on native and code-mixed samples of a semantically related task (hate detection in our case). Finally, in our third approach, we evaluated the efficacy of VMLMs via few-shot context prompting and instruction finetuning. Some interesting findings we got are (i) adding native samples improved humor (raising the F1-score up to 6.76%) and sarcasm (raising the F1-score up to 8.64%) detection, (ii) training MLMs in an MTL framework boosted performance for both humour (raising the F1-score up to 10.67%) and sarcasm (increment up to 12.35% in F1-score) detection, and (iii) prompting and instruction finetuning VMLMs couldn't outperform the other approaches. Finally, our ablation studies and error analysis discovered the cases where our model is yet to improve. We provided our code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing is a technique that updates large language models (LLMs) with new information to maintain their world knowledge. This approach avoids the need to rebuild the model from scratch, thereby addressing the high costs associated with frequent retraining. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks. In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating. The code and data of EditCoT are available at: https://github.com/bebr2/EditCoT .

Abstract: Large language models, despite extensive alignment with human values and ethical principles, remain vulnerable to sophisticated jailbreak attacks that exploit their reasoning abilities. Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. To counter this, we propose Intent-Aware CoT and Reverse Thinking CoT, which decompose queries to detect malicious intent and reason in reverse to evaluate and reject harmful responses. These methods enhance reasoning robustness and strengthen the model's defense against adversarial exploits.

Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains. Math Word Problems (MWPs) serve as a crucial benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities. While most research primarily focuses on improving accuracy, it often neglects understanding and addressing the underlying patterns of errors. Current error classification methods rely on static and predefined categories, which limit their ability to capture the full spectrum of error patterns in mathematical reasoning. To enable systematic error analysis, we collect error samples from 15 different LLMs of varying sizes across four distinct MWP datasets using multiple sampling strategies. Based on this extensive collection, we introduce MWPES-300K, a comprehensive dataset containing 304,865 error samples that cover diverse error patterns and reasoning paths. To reduce human bias and enable fine-grained analysis of error patterns, we propose a novel framework for automated dynamic error classification in mathematical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that dataset characteristics significantly shape error patterns, which evolve from basic to complex manifestations as model capabilities increase. With deeper insights into error patterns, we propose Error-Aware Prompting (EAP) that incorporates common error patterns as explicit guidance, leading to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements but also raise concerns about cultural bias, often reflecting dominant narratives at the expense of under-represented subcultures. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to recognize and accurately respond to the Little Traditions within Indian society, encompassing localized cultural practices and subcultures such as caste, kinship, marriage, and religion. Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze LLMs engagement with Indian subcultures, offering critical insights into the challenges of embedding cultural diversity in AI systems.

<title>Premise-Augmented Reasoning Chains Improve Error Identification in Math reasoning with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by enabling detailed step-by-step solutions. However, due to the verbosity of LLMs, the resulting reasoning chains can be long, making it harder to verify the reasoning steps and trace issues resulting from dependencies between the steps that may be farther away in the sequence of steps. Importantly, mathematical reasoning allows each step to be derived from a small set of premises, which are a subset of the preceding steps in the reasoning chain. In this paper, we present a framework that identifies the premises for each step, to improve the evaluation of reasoning. We restructure conventional linear reasoning chains into Premise Augmented Reasoning Chains (PARC) by introducing premise links, resulting in a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are the steps and the edges are the premise links. Through experiments with a PARC-based dataset that we built, namely PERL (Premises and ERrors identification in LLMs), we demonstrate that LLMs can reliably identify premises within complex reasoning chains. In particular, even open-source LLMs achieve 90% recall in premise identification. We also show that PARC helps to identify errors in reasoning chains more reliably. The accuracy of error identification improves by 6% to 16% absolute when step-by-step verification is carried out in PARC under the premises. Our findings highlight the utility of premise-centric representations in addressing complex problem-solving tasks and open new avenues for improving the reliability of LLM-based reasoning evaluations.

Abstract: While recent efforts have begun integrating large language models (LLMs) into English education, they often rely on traditional approaches to learning tasks without fully embracing educational methodologies, thus lacking adaptability to language learning. To address this gap, we argue that LLMs have the potential to serve as effective tutors in English Education. Specifically, LLMs can play three critical roles: (1) as data enhancers, improving the creation of learning materials or serving as student simulations; (2) as task predictors, serving as learner assessment or optimizing learning pathway; and (3) as agents, enabling personalized and inclusive education. We encourage interdisciplinary research to explore these roles, fostering innovation while addressing challenges and risks, ultimately advancing English Education through the thoughtful integration of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire information from pre-training corpora, but their stored knowledge can become inaccurate or outdated over time. Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/RLEdit.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge leverages the generative and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate LLM responses across diverse scenarios, providing accurate preference signals. This approach plays a vital role in aligning LLMs with human values, ensuring ethical and reliable AI outputs that align with societal norms. Recent studies have raised many methods to train LLM as generative judges, but most of them are data consuming or lack accuracy, and only focus on LLM's judge ability. In this work, we regard judge ability as a general ability of LLM and implement a two-stage training approach, comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up and direct preference optimization (DPO) enhancement, to achieve judge style adaptation and improve judgment accuracy. Additionally, we introduce an efficient data synthesis method to generate judgmental content. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, utilizing only about 2% to 40% of the data required by other methods, achieves SOTA performance on RewardBench. Furthermore, our training method enhances the general capabilities of the model by constructing complicated judge task, and the judge signals provided by our model have significantly enhanced the downstream DPO training performance of our internal models in our test to optimize policy model with Judge Model. We also open-source our model weights and training data to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained using massive datasets, which often contain undesirable content such as harmful texts, personal information, and copyrighted material. To address this, machine unlearning aims to remove information from trained models. Recent work has shown that soft token attacks (STA) can successfully extract unlearned information from LLMs, but in this work we show that STAs can be an inadequate tool for auditing unlearning. Using common benchmarks such as Who Is Harry Potter? and TOFU, we demonstrate that in a strong auditor setting such attacks can elicit any information from the LLM, regardless of the deployed unlearning algorithm or whether the queried content was originally present in the training corpus. We further show that STA with just a few soft tokens (1-10) can elicit random strings over 400 characters long, indicating that STAs must be used carefully to effectively audit unlearning.

Abstract: We present a study to benchmark representative watermarking methods in cross-lingual settings. The current literature mainly focuses on the evaluation of watermarking methods for the English language. However, the literature for evaluating watermarking in cross-lingual settings is scarce. This results in overlooking important adversary scenarios in which a cross-lingual adversary could be in, leading to a gray area of practicality over cross-lingual watermarking. In this paper, we evaluate four watermarking methods in four different and vocabulary rich languages. Our experiments investigate the quality of text under different watermarking procedure and the detectability of watermarks with practical translation attack scenarios. Specifically, we investigate practical scenarios that an adversary with cross-lingual knowledge could take, and evaluate whether current watermarking methods are suitable for such scenarios. Finally, from our findings, we draw key insights about watermarking in cross-lingual settings.

Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction fine-tuning for Large Language Models is fundamentally constrained by the quality and efficiency of training datasets. This work introduces Low-Confidence Gold (LCG), a novel filtering framework that employs centroid-based clustering and confidence-guided selection for identifying valuable instruction pairs. Through a semi-supervised approach using a lightweight classifier trained on representative samples, LCG curates high-quality subsets while preserving data diversity. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that models fine-tuned on LCG-filtered subsets of 6K samples achieve superior performance compared to existing methods, with substantial improvements on MT-bench and consistent gains across comprehensive evaluation metrics. The framework's efficacy while maintaining model performance establishes a promising direction for efficient instruction tuning.

Abstract: Hallucinated outputs from large language models (LLMs) pose risks in the medical domain, especially for lay audiences making health-related decisions. Existing automatic factual consistency evaluation methods, such as entailment- and question-answering (QA) -based, struggle with plain language summarization (PLS) due to elaborative explanation phenomenon, which introduces external content (e.g., definitions, background, examples) absent from the scientific abstract to enhance comprehension. To address this, we introduce PlainQAFact, an automatic factual consistency evaluation metric trained on a fine-grained, human-annotated dataset PlainFact, for evaluating factual consistency of both source-simplified and elaborately explained sentences. PlainQAFact first classifies sentence type, then applies a retrieval-augmented QA scoring method. Empirical results show that existing evaluation metrics fail to evaluate the factual consistency in PLS, especially for elaborative explanations, whereas PlainQAFact consistently outperforms them across all evaluation settings. We further analyze PlainQAFact's effectiveness across external knowledge sources, answer extraction strategies, answer overlap measures, and document granularity levels, refining its overall factual consistency assessment. Taken together, our work presents the first evaluation metric designed for PLS factual consistency evaluation, providing the community with both a robust benchmark and a practical tool to advance reliable and safe plain language communication in the medical domain.

<title>X-EcoMLA: Upcycling Pre-Trained Attention into MLA for Efficient and Extreme KV Compression</title>

Abstract: Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is designed to optimize KV cache memory through low-rank key-value joint compression. Rather than caching keys and values separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing memory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory efficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation lies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be trained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits fully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different attention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post training distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention into an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training adaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that leveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training accuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising model performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the benchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression achieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU hours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average score drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in applying existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world, large-scale, multi-database environments. Through error analysis, we identify two major challenges in schema linking: (1) Database Retrieval: accurately selecting the target database from a large schema pool, while effectively filtering out irrelevant ones; and (2) Schema Item Grounding: precisely identifying the relevant tables and columns within complex and often redundant schemas for SQL generation. Based on these, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework tailored for large-scale databases with thousands of fields. LinkAlign comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. Each stage supports both Agent and Pipeline execution modes, enabling balancing efficiency and performance via modular design. To enable more realistic evaluation, we construct AmbiDB, a synthetic dataset designed to reflect the ambiguity of real-world schema linking. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that LinkAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines on all schema linking metrics. Notably, it improves the overall Text-to-SQL pipeline and achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 33.09% on the Spider 2.0-Lite benchmark using only open-source LLMs, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.

Abstract: Generating high-quality stories spanning thousands of tokens requires competency across a variety of skills, from tracking plot and character arcs to keeping a consistent and engaging style. Due to the difficulty of sourcing labeled datasets and precise quality measurements, most work using large language models (LLMs) for long-form story generation uses combinations of hand-designed prompting techniques to elicit author-like behavior. This is a manual process that is highly dependent on the specific story-generation task. Motivated by the recent success of applying RL with Verifiable Rewards to domains like math and coding, we propose a general story-generation task (Next-Chapter Prediction) and a reward formulation (Verified Rewards via Completion Likelihood Improvement) that allows us to use an unlabeled book dataset as a learning signal for reasoning. We learn to reason over a story's condensed information and generate a detailed plan for the next chapter. Our reasoning is evaluated via the chapters it helps a story-generator create, and compared against non-trained and supervised finetuning (SFT) baselines. Pairwise human judgments reveal the chapters our learned reasoning produces are preferred across almost all metrics, and the effect is more pronounced in Scifi and Fantasy genres.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a widely adopted approach for knowledge injection during large language model (LLM) inference in recent years. However, due to their limited ability to exploit fine-grained inter-document relationships, current RAG implementations face challenges in effectively addressing the retrieved noise and redundancy content, which may cause error in the generation results. To address these limitations, we propose an Efficient Dynamic Clustering-based document Compression framework (EDC2-RAG) that utilizes latent inter-document relationships while simultaneously removing irrelevant information and redundant content. We validate our approach, built upon GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, on widely used knowledge-QA and Hallucination-Detection datasets. Experimental results show that our method achieves consistent performance improvements across various scenarios and experimental settings, demonstrating strong robustness and applicability. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/EDC-2-RAG.

Abstract: As inference-time scaling becomes critical for enhanced reasoning capabilities, it is increasingly becoming important to build models that are efficient to infer. We introduce Nemotron-H, a family of 8B and 56B/47B hybrid Mamba-Transformer models designed to reduce inference cost for a given accuracy level. To achieve this goal, we replace the majority of self-attention layers in the common Transformer model architecture with Mamba layers that perform constant computation and require constant memory per generated token. We show that Nemotron-H models offer either better or on-par accuracy compared to other similarly-sized state-of-the-art open-sourced Transformer models (e.g., Qwen-2.5-7B/72B and Llama-3.1-8B/70B), while being up to 3$\times$ faster at inference. To further increase inference speed and reduce the memory required at inference time, we created Nemotron-H-47B-Base from the 56B model using a new compression via pruning and distillation technique called MiniPuzzle. Nemotron-H-47B-Base achieves similar accuracy to the 56B model, but is 20% faster to infer. In addition, we introduce an FP8-based training recipe and show that it can achieve on par results with BF16-based training. This recipe is used to train the 56B model. We are releasing Nemotron-H base model checkpoints with support in Hugging Face and NeMo.

Abstract: Efficient text classification is essential for handling the increasing volume of academic publications. This study explores the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs), including BERT, SciBERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT, fine-tuned on the Web of Science (WoS-46985) dataset for scientific text classification. To enhance performance, we augment the dataset by executing seven targeted queries in the WoS database, retrieving 1,000 articles per category aligned with WoS-46985's main classes. PLMs predict labels for this unlabeled data, and a hard-voting strategy combines predictions for improved accuracy and confidence. Fine-tuning on the expanded dataset with dynamic learning rates and early stopping significantly boosts classification accuracy, especially in specialized domains. Domain-specific models like SciBERT and BioBERT consistently outperform general-purpose models such as BERT. These findings underscore the efficacy of dataset augmentation, inference-driven label prediction, hard-voting, and fine-tuning techniques in creating robust and scalable solutions for automated academic text classification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential in the field of health care, yet they face great challenges in adapting to rapidly evolving medical knowledge. This can lead to outdated or contradictory treatment suggestions. This study investigated how LLMs respond to evolving clinical guidelines, focusing on concept drift and internal inconsistencies. We developed the DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution and assessed the temporal reliability of various LLMs. Our evaluation of seven state-of-the-art models across 4,290 scenarios demonstrated difficulties in rejecting outdated recommendations and frequently endorsing conflicting guidance. Additionally, we explored two mitigation strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and preference fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization. While each method improved model performance, their combination led to the most consistent and reliable results. These findings underscore the need to improve LLM robustness to temporal shifts to ensure more dependable applications in clinical practice. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/RDBH/DriftMed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are hampered by hallucinations. A particularly challenging variant, knowledge overshadowing, occurs when one piece of activated knowledge inadvertently masks another relevant piece, leading to erroneous outputs even with high-quality training data. Current understanding of overshadowing is largely confined to inference-time observations, lacking deep insights into its origins and internal mechanisms during model training. Therefore, we introduce PhantomCircuit, a novel framework designed to comprehensively analyze and detect knowledge overshadowing. By innovatively employing knowledge circuit analysis, PhantomCircuit dissects the function of key components in the circuit and how the attention pattern dynamics contribute to the overshadowing phenomenon and its evolution throughout the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate PhantomCircuit's effectiveness in identifying such instances, offering novel insights into this elusive hallucination and providing the research community with a new methodological lens for its potential mitigation.

<title>Language Mixing in Reasoning Language Models: Patterns, Impact, and Internal Causes</title>

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) excel at complex tasks by leveraging a chain-of-thought process to generate structured intermediate steps. However, language mixing, i.e., reasoning steps containing tokens from languages other than the prompt, has been observed in their outputs and shown to affect performance, though its impact remains debated. We present the first systematic study of language mixing in RLMs, examining its patterns, impact, and internal causes across 15 languages, 7 task difficulty levels, and 18 subject areas, and show how all three factors influence language mixing. Moreover, we demonstrate that the choice of reasoning language significantly affects performance: forcing models to reason in Latin or Han scripts via constrained decoding notably improves accuracy. Finally, we show that the script composition of reasoning traces closely aligns with that of the model's internal representations, indicating that language mixing reflects latent processing preferences in RLMs. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing multilingual reasoning and open new directions for controlling reasoning languages to build more interpretable and adaptable RLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of multimodal models capable of speech communications. Unlike text interactions, speech conveys diverse information, including acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models lack instances mimicking real scenarios and predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the speech conversational abilities, comprising 9,400 carefully curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers a broad range of fundamental skills essential for effective vocal interactions. For the evaluation scheme, we propose several objective evaluation indicators and incorporate an additional LLM-as-a-judge approach to score open-ended questions. Experimental results on 15 mainstream systems reveal significant variability, each exhibiting distinct strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future research in speech interaction systems.

<title>Too Consistent to Detect: A Study of Self-Consistent Errors in LLMs</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatedly generate the same incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as the LLM scale increases, the frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All four types of detection methods significantly struggle to detect self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current detection methods and underscore the need for improvement. Motivated by the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.

<title>Fast Quiet-STaR: Thinking Without Thought Tokens</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a range of natural language processing tasks. However, recent advances demonstrate that further gains particularly in complex reasoning tasks require more than merely scaling up model sizes or training data. One promising direction is to enable models to think during the reasoning process. Recently, Quiet STaR significantly improves reasoning by generating token-level thought traces, but incurs substantial inference overhead. In this work, we propose Fast Quiet STaR, a more efficient reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of token-level reasoning while reducing computational cost. Our method introduces a curriculum learning based training strategy that gradually reduces the number of thought tokens, enabling the model to internalize more abstract and concise reasoning processes. We further extend this approach to the standard Next Token Prediction (NTP) setting through reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, resulting in Fast Quiet-STaR NTP, which eliminates the need for explicit thought token generation during inference. Experiments on four benchmark datasets with Mistral 7B and Qwen2.5 7B demonstrate that Fast Quiet-STaR consistently outperforms Quiet-STaR in terms of average accuracy under the same inference time budget. Notably, Fast Quiet-STaR NTP achieves an average accuracy improvement of 9\% on Mistral 7B and 5.7\% on Qwen2.5 7B, while maintaining the same inference latency. Our code will be available at https://github.com/huangwei200012/Fast-Quiet-STaR.

Abstract: Podcasts have become daily companions for half a billion users. Given the enormous amount of podcast content available, highlights provide a valuable signal that helps viewers get the gist of an episode and decide if they want to invest in listening to it in its entirety. However, identifying highlights automatically is challenging due to the unstructured and long-form nature of the content. We introduce Rhapsody, a dataset of 13K podcast episodes paired with segment-level highlight scores derived from YouTube's 'most replayed' feature. We frame the podcast highlight detection as a segment-level binary classification task. We explore various baseline approaches, including zero-shot prompting of language models and lightweight fine-tuned language models using segment-level classification heads. Our experimental results indicate that even state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4o and Gemini struggle with this task, while models fine-tuned with in-domain data significantly outperform their zero-shot performance. The fine-tuned model benefits from leveraging both speech signal features and transcripts. These findings highlight the challenges for fine-grained information access in long-form spoken media.

<title>Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs -- through an iterative critique and refinement process without external supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to 54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is essential for advancing scientific and engineering fields but is hindered by operational complexity, high expertise requirements, and limited accessibility. This paper introduces ChatCFD, an automated agent system for OpenFOAM simulations that processes multi-modal inputs (e.g., research papers, meshes) via an interactive interface, leveraging DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 large language models, a multi-agent architecture, and OpenFOAM knowledge. Its four-stage pipeline (Knowledge Base Construction, User Input Processing, Case File Generation, and Execution and Error Reflection) enables iterative trial-reflection-refinement for intricate setups, supporting diverse physical models and external meshes. Validation on 205 benchmark tutorial cases, 110 perturbed variants, and 2 literature-derived cases shows ChatCFD's 82.1 percent operational success rate on basic cases, outperforming MetaOpenFOAM (6.2 percent) and Foam-Agent (42.3 percent), and 60-80 percent on literature-derived complex cases. Turbulence model studies show a 40 percent success rate for common models versus 10 percent for rare ones like RNG k-epsilon. Physics coupling analyses reveal higher resource demands for multi-physics-coupled cases, while LLM bias toward simpler setups introduces persistent errors, such as dimensional inconsistency. Ablation studies highlight the efficacy of RAG-based modules and reflection mechanisms. By automating hypothesis testing and parameter exploration, ChatCFD accelerates scientific discovery in fluid mechanics and engineering, addressing LLM limitations through structured design and showing strong potential as a modular component in MCP-based agent networks for collaborative multi-agent systems, paving the way for scalable AI-driven CFD innovation. The code for ChatCFD is available at https://github.com/ConMoo/ChatCFD.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are available at https://github.com/YuanChang98/tree-review.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation.

<title>RADIANT: Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT -- Introducing RAG-ability and Entity-Context Divergence</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content. Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and factually coherent content generation.

Abstract: Dense retrievers often struggle with queries involving less-frequent entities due to their limited entity knowledge. We propose the Knowledgeable Passage Retriever (KPR), a BERT-based retriever enhanced with a context-entity attention layer and dynamically updatable entity embeddings. This design enables KPR to incorporate external entity knowledge without retraining. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that KPR consistently improves retrieval accuracy, with particularly large gains on the EntityQuestions dataset. When built on the off-the-shelf bge-base retriever, KPR achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly sized models on two datasets. Models and code are released at https://github.com/knowledgeable-embedding/knowledgeable-embedding.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods, such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement, a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

<title>Not All Features Deserve Attention: Graph-Guided Dependency Learning for Tabular Data Generation with Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs' attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality. Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a conversation, poses unique challenges for traditional NLP. Existing benchmarks are limited by their narrow language pairs and tasks, failing to adequately assess large language models' (LLMs) code-mixing abilities. Despite the recognized importance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this context remains sparse. Additionally, current techniques for synthesizing code-mixed data are underdeveloped to generate code-mixing. In response, we introduce CodeMixBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight tasks, including three specific to LLMs and five traditional NLP tasks, and 18 languages across seven language families. We also propose a new method for generating large-scale synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting. Our evaluation reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets involving different language families. Enhancements in training data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could improve their performance. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Jeromeyluck/CodeMixBench.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts, with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who interacted with the \texttt{Welzijn.AI} chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 14 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors. This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at https://e-m-n-l-p.github.io/.

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%).

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Accurate Sign Language Translation in Low-Resource Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity, the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore, they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for underrepresented linguistic communities.

<title>MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning</title>

Abstract: The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many natural language processing tasks but face challenges in domain-specific, analytical tasks such as conducting research surveys. This study introduces ResearchArena, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in conducting academic surveys -- a foundational step in academic research. ResearchArena models the process in three stages: (1) information discovery, identifying relevant literature; (2) information selection, evaluating papers' relevance and impact; and (3) information organization, structuring knowledge into hierarchical frameworks such as mind-maps. Notably, mind-map construction is treated as a bonus task, reflecting its supplementary role in survey-writing. To support these evaluations, we construct an offline environment of 12M full-text academic papers and 7.9K survey papers. To ensure ethical compliance, we do not redistribute copyrighted materials; instead, we provide code to construct the environment from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC). Preliminary evaluations reveal that LLM-based approaches underperform compared to simpler keyword-based retrieval methods, though recent reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 show slightly better zero-shot performance. These results underscore significant opportunities for advancing LLMs in autonomous research. We open-source the code to construct the ResearchArena benchmark at https://github.com/cxcscmu/ResearchArena.

Abstract: Traditional robot simulators focus on physical process modeling and realistic rendering, often suffering from high computational costs, inefficiencies, and limited adaptability. To handle this issue, we concentrate on behavior simulation in robotics to analyze and validate the logic behind robot behaviors, aiming to achieve preliminary evaluation before deploying resource-intensive simulators and thus enhance simulation efficiency. In this paper, we propose BeSimulator, a modular and novel LLM-powered framework, as an attempt towards behavior simulation in the context of text-based environments. By constructing text-based virtual environments and performing semantic-level simulation, BeSimulator can generalize across scenarios and achieve long-horizon complex simulation. Inspired by human cognition paradigm, it employs a ``consider-decide-capture-transfer'' four-phase simulation process, termed Chain of Behavior Simulation (CBS), which excels at analyzing action feasibility and state transition. Additionally, BeSimulator incorporates code-driven reasoning to enable arithmetic operations and enhance reliability, and reflective feedback to refine simulation. Based on our manually constructed behavior-tree-based simulation benchmark, BTSIMBENCH, our experiments show a significant performance improvement in behavior simulation compared to baselines, ranging from 13.60% to 24.80%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Dawn888888/BeSimulator.

<title>Causal Representation Learning with Generative Artificial Intelligence: Application to Texts as Treatments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00903</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2410.00903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference with unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the power of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Specifically, we propose to use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to efficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for subsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true internal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest, such as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown confounding features. Unlike existing methods, the proposed GenAI-Powered Inference (GPI) methodology eliminates the need to learn causal representation from the data, and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We formally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification of the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the violation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning. Finally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed GPI methodology to the settings in which the treatment feature is based on human perception. The GPI is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to regenerate existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using the generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama~3, to illustrate the advantages of our estimator over state-of-the-art causal representation learning algorithms.

<title>ETF: An Entity Tracing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Code Summaries</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand both natural language and code, driving their use in tasks like natural language-to-code (NL2Code) and code summarisation. However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to process multi-modal data, providing enhanced contextual understanding of complex problems. MLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA); however, they often struggle with fundamental engineering problems, and there is a scarcity of specialized datasets for training on topics like digital electronics. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark dataset called ElectroVizQA specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' performance on digital electronic circuit problems commonly found in undergraduate curricula. This dataset, the first of its kind tailored for the VQA task in digital electronics, comprises approximately 626 visual questions, offering a comprehensive overview of digital electronics topics. This paper rigorously assesses the extent to which MLLMs can understand and solve digital electronic circuit questions, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations within this specialized domain. By introducing this benchmark dataset, we aim to motivate further research and development in the application of MLLMs to engineering education, ultimately bridging the performance gap and enhancing the efficacy of these models in technical fields.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs, particularly in language reasoning and tool integration, have rapidly sparked the \emph{Language Agents} for real-world development. Among these, travel planning represents a prominent domain, combining complex multi-objective planning challenges with practical deployment demands. However, existing benchmarks often oversimplify real-world requirements by focusing on synthetic queries and limited constraints. We address the gap of evaluating language agents in multi-day, multi-POI travel planning scenarios with diverse and open human needs. Specifically, we introduce \emph{ChinaTravel}, the first open-ended benchmark grounded in authentic Chinese travel requirements collected from 1,154 human participants. We design a compositionally generalizable domain-specific language (DSL) for scalable evaluation, covering feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and preference comparison. Empirical studies reveal the potential of neuro-symbolic agents in travel planning, achieving a 37.0\% constraint satisfaction rate on human queries, a 10\times improvement over purely neural models. These findings highlight ChinaTravel as a pivotal milestone for advancing language agents in complex, real-world planning scenarios.

Abstract: Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, particularly in recognizing geographic information from images. However, VLMs still show regional biases in this task. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce a benchmark consisting of 1,200 images paired with detailed geographic metadata. Evaluating four VLMs, we find that while these models demonstrate the ability to recognize geographic information from images, achieving up to 53.8% accuracy in city prediction, they exhibit significant biases. Specifically, performance is substantially higher for economically developed and densely populated regions compared to less developed (-12.5%) and sparsely populated (-17.0%) areas. Moreover, regional biases of frequently over-predicting certain locations remain. For instance, they consistently predict Sydney for images taken in Australia, shown by the low entropy scores for these countries. The strong performance of VLMs also raises privacy concerns, particularly for users who share images online without the intent of being identified. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/uscnlp-lime/FairLocator.

Abstract: This research investigates both explicit and implicit social biases exhibited by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The key distinction between these bias types lies in the level of awareness: explicit bias refers to conscious, intentional biases, while implicit bias operates subconsciously. To analyze explicit bias, we directly pose questions to VLMs related to gender and racial differences: (1) Multiple-choice questions based on a given image (e.g., "What is the education level of the person in the image?") (2) Yes-No comparisons using two images (e.g., "Is the person in the first image more educated than the person in the second image?") For implicit bias, we design tasks where VLMs assist users but reveal biases through their responses: (1) Image description tasks: Models are asked to describe individuals in images, and we analyze disparities in textual cues across demographic groups. (2) Form completion tasks: Models draft a personal information collection form with 20 attributes, and we examine correlations among selected attributes for potential biases. We evaluate Gemini-1.5, GPT-4V, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.2-Vision and LLaVA-v1.6. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/uscnlp-lime/VisBias.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models.

Abstract: Frontier models that generate extended reasoning traces inadvertently produce rich token sequences that can facilitate model distillation. Recognizing this vulnerability, model owners may seek sampling strategies that limit the effectiveness of distillation without compromising model performance. Antidistillation sampling provides exactly this capability. By strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution, antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them significantly less effective for distillation while preserving the model's practical utility.

arXiv:2504.13707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve and agent applications become more widespread, the underlying deception risks urgently require systematic evaluation and effective oversight. Unlike existing evaluation which uses simulated games or presents limited choices, we introduce OpenDeception, a novel deception evaluation framework with an open-ended scenario dataset. OpenDeception jointly evaluates both the deception intention and capabilities of LLM-based agents by inspecting their internal reasoning process. Specifically, we construct five types of common use cases where LLMs intensively interact with the user, each consisting of ten diverse, concrete scenarios from the real world. To avoid ethical concerns and costs of high-risk deceptive interactions with human testers, we propose to simulate the multi-turn dialogue via agent simulation. Extensive evaluation of eleven mainstream LLMs on OpenDeception highlights the urgent need to address deception risks and security concerns in LLM-based agents: the deception intention ratio across the models exceeds 80%, while the deception success rate surpasses 50%. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs with stronger capabilities do exhibit a higher risk of deception, which calls for more alignment efforts on inhibiting deceptive behaviors.

arXiv:2505.13398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic, perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations, independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.

Abstract: Finding interesting phenomena is the core of scientific discovery, but it is a manual, ill-defined concept. We present an integrative pipeline for automating the discovery of interesting simple hypotheses (feature-target relations with effect direction and a potential underlying mechanism) in structured biomedical data. The pipeline combines machine learning, knowledge graphs, literature search and Large Language Models. We formalize "interestingness" as a combination of novelty, utility and plausibility. On 8 major diseases from the UK Biobank, our pipeline consistently recovers risk factors years before their appearance in the literature. 40--53% of our top candidates were validated as interesting, compared to 0--7% for a SHAP-based baseline. Overall, 28% of 109 candidates were interesting to medical experts. The pipeline addresses the challenge of operationalizing "interestingness" scalably and for any target. We release data and code: https://github.com/LinialLab/InterFeat

Abstract: This paper presents Project Riley, a novel multimodal and multi-model conversational AI architecture oriented towards the simulation of reasoning influenced by emotional states. Drawing inspiration from Pixar's Inside Out, the system comprises five distinct emotional agents - Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust - that engage in structured multi-round dialogues to generate, criticise, and iteratively refine responses. A final reasoning mechanism synthesises the contributions of these agents into a coherent output that either reflects the dominant emotion or integrates multiple perspectives. The architecture incorporates both textual and visual large language models (LLMs), alongside advanced reasoning and self-refinement processes. A functional prototype was deployed locally in an offline environment, optimised for emotional expressiveness and computational efficiency. From this initial prototype, another one emerged, called Armando, which was developed for use in emergency contexts, delivering emotionally calibrated and factually accurate information through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and cumulative context tracking. The Project Riley prototype was evaluated through user testing, in which participants interacted with the chatbot and completed a structured questionnaire assessing three dimensions: Emotional Appropriateness, Clarity and Utility, and Naturalness and Human-likeness. The results indicate strong performance in structured scenarios, particularly with respect to emotional alignment and communicative clarity.

arXiv:2506.07963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate vision-language alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are naturally inverse dual tasks, we propose \textbf{SUDER} (\textbf{S}elf-improving \textbf{U}nified LMMs with \textbf{D}ual s\textbf{E}lf-\textbf{R}ewards), a framework reinforcing the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs with a self-supervised dual reward mechanism. SUDER leverages the inherent duality between understanding and generation tasks to provide self-supervised optimization signals for each other. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood within the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

<title>An LLM + ASP Workflow for Joint Entity-Relation Extraction</title>

arXiv:2508.12611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive, time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models (LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems in several categories with only 10\% of training data. It is able to achieve a 2.5 times (35\% over 15\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&amp;P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Persuasive Dialogues, Dual Evaluation, Misinformation, Robustness<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in balancing gullibility to misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues. The DuET-PD framework evaluates stance-change dynamics across persuasion types and domains, revealing low accuracy in knowledge and safety domains under sustained misleading persuasions. Newer open-source models exhibit increasing sycophancy, highlighting a need for improvement. The Holistic DPO training approach enhances LLMs' robustness to misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, significantly improving accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts. These contributions pave the way for more reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue.<br />

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type (corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions. Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/DuET-PD.

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses. Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex, real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, Chart Reasoning Benchmark, Visual Reasoning, ChartUnderstanding, ChartReasoner

Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance in chart understanding, but they often struggle with non-annotated charts, raising questions about their true understanding. A new Chart Reasoning Benchmark (CRBench) was developed to evaluate MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. The study found that MLLMs rely more on recognition than reasoning when interpreting charts. To address this, the ChartReasoner model was proposed to improve rational chart understanding by mimicking human behavior. Testing on CRBench showed ChartReasoner's superiority over other models like GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. ChartReasoner also demonstrated enhanced visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension, leading to significant performance gains for MLLMs. Overall, this research highlights the importance of grounding estimation in chart understanding to enhance MLLMs' ability to interpret charts effectively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the strongest predictor of linking success.

Summary: <br /><br />The article introduces the Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) for multimodal sentiment analysis, combining a powerful Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with a lightweight baseline model. The system utilizes an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the small model filters input samples, escalating only those with high uncertainty to the MLLM for deeper analysis. Strategies are implemented to handle ambiguous or conflicting predictions, such as weighted averaging and prompt-based cross-verification. This approach dynamically allocates computational resources, significantly reducing inference costs while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the U-ACS method achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational requirements compared to using a standalone MLLM. <div>

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty, are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis. Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to using a standalone MLLM.

Summary: 
The article discusses the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) in peer review, highlighting the potential risks to fairness and reliability. Concerns arise from the use of LLMs to generate substantive review content, leading to challenges for existing general AI-generated text detectors in distinguishing between language refinement and content generation. To address this, the authors propose a shift towards content-based detection, introducing CoCoNUTS, a benchmark focused on AI-generated peer reviews. They also develop CoCoDet, an AI review detector using a multi-task learning framework to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. This work aims to provide a foundation for evaluating LLMs in peer review and advancing more precise and equitable detection methods for scholarly applications. The code and data for CoCoNUTS will be publicly available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

<br />Summary: 
The paper introduces PostToPersonality (PtoP), a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) from social media posts. PtoP addresses challenges such as hallucination in LLMs and the imbalanced distribution of MBTI types by utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation and synthetic minority oversampling. By fine-tuning a pretrained LLM, PtoP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 10 baseline ML and DL techniques on a real-world social media dataset. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in inferring personality traits from social media content and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving MBTI prediction accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2509.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently, the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content. However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges: the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

Summary: 
- GPT-5 outperformed GPT-4 and GPT-4o in a BioNLP benchmark across various tasks.
- GPT-5 achieved high accuracy in biomedical question answering tasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models.
- The model showed significant improvements in named entity recognition and relation extraction tasks.
- However, performance in text summarization and disease NER tasks still lags behind domain-specific baselines.
- The results suggest that GPT-5 is suitable for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA but may require fine-tuning for precision-critical tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering, its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached 94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734). In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines. These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as frontier models advance.

arXiv:2509.04464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that, when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question, a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

Summary: This paper investigates the impact of emotional expressions on buyer-seller dispute dialogues and their outcomes. It explores the use of automatic text emotion recognition in conflict resolution. The study demonstrates that large-language models are more effective at annotating emotion intensity and aligning with human annotators' decisions. Findings suggest that emotional expressions play a crucial role in conflict escalation and resolution. The results support existing theoretical models on the influence of emotions in disputes. The paper also proposes that agent-based systems could be valuable in managing conflicts by detecting and potentially mitigating emotional escalations. <div>

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts' thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes. We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional escalation.

<div> evolve, task representations, context, language models, adaptation
Summary:<br /><br />Language models can learn new tasks by forming task representations in-context without weight updates. Task representations evolve in non-monotonic ways and condense multiple evidence into transferrable representations. These representations exhibit strong temporal and semantic locality, capturing minimal task scopes and supporting longer tasks with more temporally-distributed representations. Models rely on a two-fold locality, adapting just-in-time to new evidence and tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate \emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and \emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on ''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'', such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks. This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

<div> Pruning, Large Language Models, Prefill-decode disaggregation, KV Cache, Inference<br />Summary:<br />Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but computationally expensive. A new pruning method is proposed for prefill-decode disaggregation inference, focusing on block and KV Cache pruning. This method iteratively removes blocks independently for the prefill and decode stages, leading to more efficient pruning solutions. Additionally, a token-aware cache pruning mechanism is introduced, optimizing data transmission bandwidth consumption. Experimental results show strong performance improvements in both disaggregation and unified settings. The proposed approach achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption. <div>
arXiv:2509.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities: multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation, significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and cost-performance optimization.

<div> Keywords: COCORELI, hybrid agent framework, large language models, spatial reasoning, abstraction<br />
Summary: <br />
The COCORELI framework addresses limitations of large language models (LLMs) in complex instruction-following tasks, spatial reasoning, and minimizing hallucination. By integrating medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a discourse module, COCORELI can parse instructions and dynamically learn high-level representations of the environment. In collaborative construction tasks, COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic LLM systems using larger LLMs. It achieves this by avoiding hallucinations, identifying missing information, seeking clarifications, and updating learned objects. The framework's abstraction abilities extend beyond the environment, as demonstrated in the ToolBench API completion task. <div>

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations, identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown in the ToolBench API completion task.

Summary: 
Radiology reports contain valuable clinical information that can be used to train imaging models without the need for extensive manual annotation. The MOSAIC approach addresses limitations of existing methods by offering a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally efficient solution using a compact open-access language model. MOSAIC achieves high performance across multiple datasets in various languages and imaging modalities, with a mean macro F1 score of 88 on chest X-ray datasets. The model requires only 24 GB of GPU memory and can achieve strong results with minimal annotated samples, making it a practical alternative to larger or proprietary language models in clinical settings. Code and models are open-source, inviting further evaluation and extension in different languages, taxonomies, and modalities.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets, approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86 with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RECAP, a new benchmark for evaluating intent rewriting in user-agent dialogues. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle with ambiguous or dynamic dialogues, leading to poor planning outcomes. RECAP focuses on challenges like ambiguity, intent drift, and mixed-goal conversations. The benchmark includes an LLM-based evaluator to assess planning utility based on rewritten intents. A prompt-based rewriting approach outperforms baselines, and fine-tuning DPO-based rewriters further improves utility. The results suggest that intent rewriting is critical for enhancing agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems. <div>

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

<div> adapter, speech embeddings, LLM-compatible tokens, automatic speech recognition, named entity recognition

Summary:
The paper introduces a parameter-efficient adapter that converts speech embeddings into tokens compatible with Large Language Models (LLMs). This adapter is designed to improve performance in end-to-end tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis (SA). By utilizing an LLM-based synthetic dataset annotation technique, labeling costs are reduced. The proposed adapter, with significantly fewer trainable parameters, achieves noteworthy performance improvements across tasks: a 26% relative Word Error Rates (WER) enhancement in ASR, a 6.3% relative F1 score increase in NER, and a 32% relative F1 score boost in SA. Additionally, incorporating techniques like a classifier regularizer and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimization further enhances performance, resulting in a 6.6% and 9.5% improvement in Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) scores.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

<div> Speculative decoding, test-time scaling, language models, benchmark, n-gram-based methods <br />
Summary: <br />
Test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) can be enhanced through speculative decoding to reduce computational overhead. A new benchmark has been introduced to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM test-time scaling, providing protocols for different scaling paradigms. Model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based speculative decoding methods were compared, with n-gram-based methods showing effectiveness in capturing repetitive patterns. Combining n-gram-based methods with other approaches can balance acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning paths in test-time scaling. Further research on speculative decoding for test-time scaling is encouraged to improve reasoning efficiency in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2509.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces, leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods. Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

<div> scaling paradigm, native thought parallelism, Tunnel Vision, ParaThinker, reasoning potential 

Summary:
The article introduces a new scaling paradigm called native thought parallelism to address the limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights the concept of Tunnel Vision, where sequential reasoning paths hit a performance bottleneck. The proposed framework, ParaThinker, trains LLMs to generate multiple diverse reasoning paths in parallel, leading to better final answers. By exploring various lines of thought simultaneously, ParaThinker sidesteps Tunnel Vision and unlocks the model's latent reasoning potential. The approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width) is more effective than scaling sequentially (depth) in achieving superior reasoning. Results show substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs, with minimal latency overhead, enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones. This emphasizes the importance of parallel thinking as a key dimension in scaling future LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer, sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width) is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5% for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient dimension for scaling future LLMs.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new text-to-molecule model called Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5) that utilizes substructure-level tokenization to better capture global structural contexts within molecules. This approach focuses on key substructures, enhancing the model's ability to understand molecular semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAMT5's superiority in text-to-molecule generation tasks, even outperforming existing methods with minimal training data. The authors also propose an ensemble strategy to further improve generation performance by combining outputs from multiple models. The code for CAMT5 is available on GitHub for interested users to access and utilize. <div>

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However, they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks. Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to further boost the generation performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Songhyeontae/CAMT5.git.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

<div> Keywords: large language models, rare token prediction, plateau neurons, dual computational regimes, attention mechanisms

Summary: 
Rare token prediction in large language models poses a challenge due to the scarcity of data. Through analysis of GPT-2 XL and Pythia models, it was discovered that specialized "plateau" neurons are necessary for processing rare tokens, beyond the power-law regime for common tokens. These plateau neurons exist in dual computational regimes, indicating a distinct mechanism for handling rare tokens. Additionally, instead of forming modular clusters, these neurons are distributed spatially. Surprisingly, attention mechanisms do not show any bias towards routing to these specialist neurons. This suggests that rare token specialization is achieved through distributed differentiation driven by training, maintaining context-sensitive flexibility while effectively allocating adaptive capacity. <div>
arXiv:2509.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized ``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Summary: 
Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is crucial for various applications such as opinion mining and advertisement design.

To improve personalized VER, a method using discrete prompt tuning inspired by human prompt engineering is proposed. This method selects the best natural language representation from generated prompts and adapts it for accurate personalized VER. By tailoring the prompt to the individual, the proposed approach aims to enhance the performance of MLLMs in recognizing emotions at a personalized level, which is essential for practical real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design. Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of accurate personalized VER.

<div> energy-based model, reliable abstention, retrieval-augmented generation, safety-critical domains, semantic corpus <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces an energy-based model (EBM) for reliable abstention in retrieval-augmented generation systems, particularly important in safety-critical fields like women's health. The EBM learns a smooth energy landscape over a large dataset of guideline-derived questions to decide when to generate or abstain. Benchmarking against a calibrated softmax baseline and k-nearest neighbor density heuristic showed that the EBM outperformed in abstention on semantically challenging cases, achieving a higher AUROC and reducing false positive rate. The EBM's robustness primarily stems from its energy scoring head, demonstrating that energy-based scoring provides a more reliable confidence signal than probability-based scoring. This approach offers a scalable and interpretable solution for creating safe retrieval-augmented generation systems. <div>

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives, performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable foundation for safe RAG systems.

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics: \texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY}, designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

<div> Automated Support Systems, Review Comments, RevUtil Dataset, Fine-tuned Models, Machine-generated Reviews
Summary:<br />
Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is crucial in peer review, and with limited reviewer time, automated support systems are needed to ensure quality feedback. Four key aspects drive the utility of review comments for authors: Actionability, Grounding & Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. The RevUtil dataset, comprising human-labeled and synthetic data, enables evaluation of models assessing review comments. Fine-tuned models trained on the dataset demonstrate agreement levels with humans comparable to or exceeding powerful closed models. However, machine-generated reviews generally underperform human reviews on the identified aspects. The study highlights the importance of these key aspects in driving the usefulness of review comments for authors and the need for further developments in automated assessment models.

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews, automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding & Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with 10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

Summary:
ASCENDgpt is a transformer-based model designed for cardiovascular risk prediction using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). It introduces a phenotype-aware tokenization scheme that consolidates diagnosis codes and maintains semantic information, leading to a significant reduction in vocabulary size. The model is pretrained on a large dataset and fine-tuned for predicting five cardiovascular outcomes. It achieves high discrimination performance on the test set, with an average C-index of 0.816 across all outcomes. The phenotype-based approach allows for clinically interpretable predictions while remaining computationally efficient. This work highlights the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining for EHR-based risk prediction tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens, achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442 tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842, all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

<div> prompts, large language models, multi-talker, automatic speech recognition, structured prompts
Summary: 
- The study introduces serialized output prompts (SOP) to guide large language models in multi-talker automatic speech recognition systems.
- A Separator and serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are utilized to extract MT content from mixed speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner.
- The SOP serves as a prompt for the language models, improving performance in complex scenarios like the three-talker condition.
- A three-stage training strategy involving serialized output training, speech information extraction, and SOP-based adaptation is employed to effectively train the model.
- Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset demonstrate the significant improvement in performance of the proposed SOP approach in both two- and three-talker scenarios.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP, which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT) fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under both two- and three-talker conditions.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead, generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

<title>Learned Hallucination Detection in Black-Box LLMs using Token-level Entropy Production Rate</title>

<div> Keywords: Hallucination detection, Large Language Models, Question Answering, Entropy Production Rate, Supervised learning 

Summary: 
This paper presents a methodology for detecting hallucinations in outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) during Question Answering tasks. The approach is designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as using black-box LLM APIs that provide only a few top candidate log-probabilities per token. The method involves deriving uncertainty indicators directly from the log-probabilities generated during non-greedy decoding. An Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric is first introduced as a baseline, which is later enhanced with supervised learning. The learned model utilizes features representing the entropic contributions of the top-ranked tokens within a single generated sequence, without the need for multiple query re-runs. Evaluation across various QA datasets and LLMs shows that the estimator significantly improves hallucination detection compared to using EPR alone. The approach proves to be efficient and practical for API-constrained deployments, enhancing the reliability of LLM responses in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. Additionally, its utility is demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on annual reports in an industrial dataset.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering (QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection, specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top <10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on annual reports from an industrial dataset.

Summary:  
- Clinician burnout is a significant concern in high-acuity ICUs, impacting patient safety.
- Utilizing ICU discharge summaries from MIMIC-IV, this study develops a hybrid pipeline to analyze clinical narratives for burnout surveillance.
- The pipeline combines sentiment embeddings, a stress lexicon, and LDA with workload proxies to identify burnout risk.
- A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves high precision, recall, and F1 scores, outperforming metadata-only methods.
- Specialty-specific analysis reveals increased burnout risk among providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology.<br /> 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR) metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1 score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive well-being monitoring.

Summary: 
This paper investigates biases in university and program recommendations made by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Biases identified include favoring institutions in the Global North, reinforcing gender stereotypes, and repetitive recommendations. Despite LLaMA-3.1 achieving higher diversity in recommendations, disparities persist across geographic and demographic factors. The study proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation framework to measure demographic and geographic representation in recommendation systems, highlighting the need for addressing biases in educational LMs for ensuring equitable global access to higher education. <div>
arXiv:2509.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic, demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure equitable global access to higher education.

Summary:
Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents aim to provide trustworthy and source-grounded synthesis but often display overconfidence, weak sourcing, and confusing citation practices. DeepTRACE is introduced as an audit framework to analyze various dimensions including answer text, sources, and citations. By using statement-level analysis and creating citation and factual-support matrices, DeepTRACE examines how systems reason and attribute evidence. Evaluation of popular public models reveals that while deep-research configurations can reduce overconfidence and improve citation thoroughness, they still tend to produce one-sided responses on debate queries and include a large number of unsupported statements. Citation accuracy among these systems ranges from 40-80%, highlighting the challenges in ensuring reliable and well-sourced information from generative search engines and deep research agents.

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy, source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources, and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition, confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com, Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

<div> modeling, contextual signals, response quality, vulnerability, context engineering

Summary:
The study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) process and prioritize mixed contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Using the Poisoned Context Testbed, the researchers adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from neuroscience to quantify the influence of competing contextual signals on LLM outputs. The findings reveal that LLMs tend to incorporate less prevalent information from mixed contexts, leading to a susceptibility to inappropriate content that can degrade response quality. To address this vulnerability, the researchers introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach that allows the model to identify and ignore inappropriate signals internally. Empirical evaluations on the testbed show that RW-Steering significantly improves response quality and mitigates the adverse effects of mixed contexts. The approach is shown to be robust and generalizable across varying proportions of inappropriate content, making it a promising solution for enhancing LLM safety in real-world applications. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality. Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve, establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling, REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy Evolution) are presented.

Summary:
VaccineRAG addresses issues with the precision of retrievers in Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. This dataset evaluates models using varying positive/negative sample ratios to expose weaknesses in current LLMs. VaccineRAG prompts LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers, improving sample discrimination capabilities. The model also utilizes Partial-GRPO to enhance learning of long-sequence complex CoT content by treating LLM outputs as multiple components rather than a single whole, enabling better preference selections for complex sequences. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of VaccineRAG. The code and dataset will be publicly available for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models' sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be publicly released soon.

Summary:
The paper introduces a Behavioral Fingerprinting framework focused on understanding the nuanced behavioral characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond traditional performance metrics. By utilizing a Diagnostic Prompt Suite and an automated evaluation pipeline with a powerful LLM as a judge, the study analyzes eighteen models across capability tiers. The results highlight a divergence in the LLM landscape, showing convergence in core capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning but significant variations in alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness. The research also uncovers a default persona clustering among models, indicating common alignment incentives. This suggests that the interactive nature of LLMs is a direct result of specific and diverse developer alignment strategies rather than just scale or reasoning power. The framework presented offers a reproducible and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel ``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering (ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together, this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences. Project: https://github.com/JarvisPei/Behavioral-Fingerprinting

Summary:
Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have shown promise in converting non-acoustic signals into intelligible speech. While progress has been made in speech generation, recognizing and processing the synthesized speech accurately remains a challenge due to phonetic ambiguity and noise. In this study, an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework is proposed, combining a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM) for post-processing. The transformer captures the full context of utterances, while the LLM ensures linguistic consistency, leading to a significant 16% relative and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) compared to a 36% baseline. These improvements demonstrate enhanced intelligibility for silent speech interfaces.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM) for post-processing.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off, we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles, SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce subtask error rates.

<div> Keywords: virtual reality, artificial intelligence, dyslexia, Italian, Spanish

Summary:<br /><br />This study investigates the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. Using VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments, machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to differentiate between dyslexic and non-dyslexic students. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in completion time for the SR test but not in accuracy or self-esteem. Supervised ML models demonstrated an accuracy of 87.5% for Italian, 66.6% for Spanish, and 75.0% for the pooled group in classifying dyslexia presence/absence. The results suggest that VR and ML can effectively support dyslexia assessment by capturing speed differences in task completion. However, language-specific factors may impact classification accuracy. <div>

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Emotional safety, Mental health, Data augmentation, Fine-tuning

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in processing emotionally sensitive content, particularly in mental health contexts. In this study, the authors investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on tasks related to emotional safety assessment. By merging multiple human-authored mental health datasets and augmenting them with emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT, a novel dataset is created for evaluation. The study compares the performance of four LLaMA models across different settings, showing that larger models outperform smaller ones in nuanced multi-label classification and zero-shot scenarios. However, lightweight fine-tuning enables smaller models to achieve comparable results in high-data categories while maintaining low VRAM usage at inference. These findings suggest that smaller on-device models can be effective and privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications, such as therapeutic LLM applications, by helping interpret emotional context and ensuring safe conversational boundaries. The study underscores the importance of scalability and safety in developing LLM applications for mental health contexts.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs. borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance, particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings. However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller, on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical systems.

Summary: <br />
- Language models can propagate social bias, particularly in gender and ethnicity representation. 
- This study investigated biases in AI-generated occupational stories and proposed a mitigation strategy called BAME.
- BAME leverages explanations generated by models to reduce biases without altering parameters, resulting in improved demographic representation.
- Analysis of stories generated by three large language models across different occupational groups revealed persistent biases linked to training data stereotypes.
- Guiding models with their own reasoning mechanisms can enhance demographic parity and contribute to the development of more transparent generative AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories. Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME), revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%. BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes. Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

<div> Keywords: large language models, multilingual capabilities, model performance, language consistency, cross-lingual abstraction

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are expanding their multilingual capabilities, raising concerns about equity in performance across languages. This study compares two monolingual BERT models trained on Swahili and English news data to assess the impact of data disparities on model performance. The results show that the native Swahili-trained model outperformed the Swahili-to-English translated model, indicating that translation alone does not bridge representational differences between languages. This suggests the importance of native-language training for reliable outcomes, especially in educational and informational contexts where performance gaps can compound inequality. The findings highlight the need for broader dataset development for underrepresented languages and emphasize the importance of multilingual model evaluation to reduce the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing digital divides. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data, and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili, thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47% respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge representational differences between languages and that models trained in one language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality. Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing digital divides is reduced.

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling, postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance patient care.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Tool Use, Small Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization 

Summary:
Small Language Models (SLMs) struggle in tool use compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their limited knowledge base and contextual understanding. To address this challenge, this research employs Reinforcement Learning, specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally heavy and lack adaptability, while the proposed method efficiently boosts SLM tool-use accuracy, increasing their practical utility. By utilizing RL techniques, SLMs can improve their ability to interact with external resources such as APIs, databases, and software functions, making them more effective in real-world applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, and automated workflows. This approach overcomes the resource constraints and computational complexity that limit the tool-use capabilities of SLMs, providing a more compact and efficient solution for enhancing their performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs, databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations, making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy, increasing their practical utility.

Summary:
HSMP-BERT, a prompt-based model, was developed for structured extraction from Hebrew radiology reports on Crohn's disease. The study analyzed 9,683 reports from Israeli providers, with a subset of 512 reports annotated for findings across gastrointestinal organs and pathologies. HSMP-BERT outperformed baseline models in organ-finding combinations, achieving a mean F1 score of 0.83 and a $\kappa$ score of 0.65. Hierarchical inference significantly reduced runtime compared to traditional methods. The model revealed associations between ileal wall thickening, stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, and identified age- and sex-specific trends in inflammatory findings. The study demonstrates the scalability of HSMP-BERT for structured extraction in radiology and highlights AI's potential in low-resource language settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90 structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66% train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24 organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1 0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning (F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$). Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference. Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening, stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently, the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously infeasible depth.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12 state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

This paper explores methods for fine-grained control of transformer-based language models through interventions at the prompt, activation, and weight levels. The authors present a unified framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and weight-space edits for model manipulation. They address controllable text generation as an optimization problem, utilizing prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning techniques. The study analyzes robustness and safety implications, including adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations, showing that minimal weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side effects. Empirical results demonstrate high success rates in sentiment control and factual edits while maintaining base performance, though there are generalization-specificity trade-offs. The paper also addresses ethical concerns regarding dual-use risks and emphasizes the need for rigorous evaluation in designing controllable and robust language models.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts, activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects. Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation. This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language models.

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch, speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition, charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather than a text-based challenge.

<title>Sample-efficient Integration of New Modalities into Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover, integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector -- placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio, video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e., satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules) with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs 64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality coverage of foundation models.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation, fine-tuning, and editing.

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world social media text.

<title>Polysemantic Dropout: Conformal OOD Detection for Specialized LLMs</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs, posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.

<title>AraHalluEval: A Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation Framework for Arabic LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries, while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to 42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable performance in real-world settings.

<title>Why Language Models Hallucinate</title>

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+, a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195 predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9 million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included with the submission and is also available at https://youtu.be/UcnE3_GsTWs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing, which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation, thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs, reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions. Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary, underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement, an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign language.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs (BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1, GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out strategy.

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions, building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model, we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions. After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex questions.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills. Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

<title>Enhancing Diversity in Large Language Models via Determinantal Point Processes</title>

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses. Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic diversity without sacrificing model quality.

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles, reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU, GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and interpretability.

arXiv:2509.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating "confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases, enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs, enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash (50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models. Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash: 28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000 high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity were tenuous or absent.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings (GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient (DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score, and 85.50% overall accuracy.

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations (internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive insights for advancing their capabilities.

<title>Using LLMs for Multilingual Clinical Entity Linking to ICD-10</title>

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes. Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1 regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters, thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts. Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge.

<title>ACE-RL: Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced Reward for Long-form Generation Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained, adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands. Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints, converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally, we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and 7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation scenarios.

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges: Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with limited compute resources.

<title>Optimizing Small Transformer-Based Language Models for Multi-Label Sentiment Analysis in Short Texts</title>

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e., BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings. Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1) continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation, and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text datasets.

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines, offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective response generation systems.

Abstract: We present a masked diffusion language modeling framework for data-efficient training for the BabyLM 2025 Challenge. Our approach applies diffusion training objectives to language modeling under strict data constraints, incorporating frequency-informed masking that prioritizes learning from rare tokens while maintaining theoretical validity. We explore multiple noise scheduling strategies, including two-mode approaches, and investigate different noise weighting schemes within the NELBO objective. We evaluate our method on the BabyLM benchmark suite, measuring linguistic competence, world knowledge, and human-likeness. Results show performance competitive to hybrid autoregressive-masked baselines, demonstrating that diffusion-based training offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning.

arXiv:2509.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future research.

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world, causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared to other models. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/BITHLP/PRIM.

<title>Triadic Fusion of Cognitive, Functional, and Causal Dimensions for Explainable LLMs: The TAXAL Framework</title>

arXiv:2509.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs, do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing, evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services, showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways, TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice, supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of agentic AI.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across 33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects. Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31 language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

arXiv:2509.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1) recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1) popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected, identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning systems.

<title>HoPE: Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding for Stable Long-Range Dependency Modeling in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

arXiv:2509.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO) preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

arXiv:2509.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp, while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction, we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information density. Our results replicated the established relationship between information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs' subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions: parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies, scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart. However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies, scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout pretraining.

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data, and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and, conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it. We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models(LLMs) enable compelling story generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments remains an open challenge in procedural content generation(PCG). We present a lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of 2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames, extracts spatial predicates in the form of "Object-Relation-Object" triples, and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata, and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure. We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching, affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames. This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG.

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph (which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%, 4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph & configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning alone cannot fix.

Abstract: We propose DarkStream, a streaming speech synthesis model for real-time speaker anonymization. To improve content encoding under strict latency constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving real-time speech communication.

<title>Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731</link>

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated, explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of 2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum, dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit, language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries. Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Automating the decision of whether a code change requires manual review is vital for maintaining software quality in modern development workflows. However, the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks creates a critical bottleneck: while large volumes of unlabelled code are readily available, there is an insufficient amount of labelled data to train supervised models for review classification. We address this challenge by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages into equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating synthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that although LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from available unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are considered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To overcome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train supervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of these classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation systems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This approach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of annotated data.

Abstract: Digital social media platforms frequently contribute to cognitive-behavioral fixation, a phenomenon in which users exhibit sustained and repetitive engagement with narrow content domains. While cognitive-behavioral fixation has been extensively studied in psychology, methods for computationally detecting and evaluating such fixation remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for assessing cognitive-behavioral fixation by analyzing users' multimodal social media engagement patterns. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal topic extraction module and a cognitive-behavioral fixation quantification module that collaboratively enable adaptive, hierarchical, and interpretable assessment of user behavior. Experiments on existing benchmarks and a newly curated multimodal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, laying the groundwork for scalable computational analysis of cognitive fixation. All code in this project is publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/Liskie/cognitive-fixation-evaluation.

<title>SparkUI-Parser: Enhancing GUI Perception with Robust Grounding and Parsing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04908</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives. Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization, thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement, enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH, demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Sticker-TTS.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4 percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.

Abstract: We report on our tool, Pulse Infinite, that uses proof techniques to show non-termination (divergence) in large programs. Pulse Infinite works compositionally and under-approximately: the former supports scale, and the latter ensures soundness for proving divergence. Prior work focused on small benchmarks in the tens or hundreds of lines of code (LoC), and scale limits their practicality: a single company may have tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of LoC or more. We report on applying Pulse Infinite to over a hundred million lines of open-source and proprietary software written in C, C++, and Hack, identifying over 30 previously unknown issues, establishing a new state of the art for detecting divergence in real-world codebases.

Abstract: Recently multi-lingual pre-trained language models (PLM) such as mBERT and XLM-R have achieved impressive strides in cross-lingual dense retrieval. Despite its successes, they are general-purpose PLM while the multilingual PLM tailored for cross-lingual retrieval is still unexplored. Motivated by an observation that the sentences in parallel documents are approximately in the same order, which is universal across languages, we propose to model this sequential sentence relation to facilitate cross-lingual representation learning. Specifically, we propose a multilingual PLM called masked sentence model (MSM), which consists of a sentence encoder to generate the sentence representations, and a document encoder applied to a sequence of sentence vectors from a document. The document encoder is shared for all languages to model the universal sequential sentence relation across languages. To train the model, we propose a masked sentence prediction task, which masks and predicts the sentence vector via a hierarchical contrastive loss with sampled negatives. Comprehensive experiments on four cross-lingual retrieval tasks show MSM significantly outperforms existing advanced pre-training models, demonstrating the effectiveness and stronger cross-lingual retrieval capabilities of our approach. Code and model are available at https://github.com/shunyuzh/MSM.

Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.

Abstract: We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multimodal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model. Demos are shown in https://junzhan2000.github.io/AnyGPT.github.io/

Abstract: Persona agents, which are LLM agents conditioned to act according to an assigned persona, enable contextually rich and user aligned interactions across domains like education and healthcare. However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model. Importantly, increased model size and complexity do not necessarily enhance persona agent capabilities, underscoring the need for algorithmic and architectural innovation toward faithful, performant persona agents.

Abstract: Classical Arabic represents a significant era that encompasses the golden age of Arab culture, philosophy, and scientific literature. With a broad consensus on the importance of translating these literatures to enrich knowledge dissemination across communities, the advent of large language models (LLMs) and translation systems offers promising tools to facilitate this goal. However, we have identified a scarcity of translation datasets in Classical Arabic, which are often limited in scope and topics, hindering the development of high-quality translation systems. In response, we present the ATHAR dataset, which comprises 66,000 high-quality classical Arabic to English translation samples that cover a wide array of topics including science, culture, and philosophy. Furthermore, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs under various settings, concluding that there is a need for such datasets in current systems. Our findings highlight how models can benefit from fine-tuning or incorporating this dataset into their pretraining pipelines. The dataset is publicly available on the HuggingFace Data Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohamed-khalil/ATHAR.

Abstract: This paper investigates the faithfulness of multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents in a graphical user interface (GUI) environment, aiming to address the research question of whether multimodal GUI agents can be distracted by environmental context. A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model alignment leverage token-level supervisions to perform fine-grained preference optimization. However, existing token-level alignment methods either optimize on all available tokens, which can be noisy and inefficient, or perform selective training with complex and expensive key token selection strategies. In this work, we propose Selective Preference Optimization (SePO), a novel selective alignment strategy that centers on efficient key token selection. SePO proposes the first token selection method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains an oracle model to estimate a token-level reward function on the target data. This method applies to any existing alignment datasets with response-level annotations and enables cost-efficient token selection with small-scale oracle models and training data. The estimated reward function is then utilized to score all tokens within the target dataset, where only the key tokens are selected to supervise the target policy model with a reference model-free contrastive objective function. Extensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks show that SePO significantly outperforms competitive baseline methods by only optimizing 30% key tokens on the target dataset. SePO applications on weak-to-strong generalization show that weak oracle models effectively supervise strong policy models with up to 16.8x more parameters. SePO also effectively selects key tokens from out-of-distribution data to enhance strong policy models and alleviate the over-optimization problem.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new data synthesis method called \textbf{LogicPro}, which leverages LeetCode-style algorithm \underline{Pro}blems and their corresponding \underline{Pro}gram solutions to synthesize Complex \underline{Logic}al Reasoning data in text format. First, we synthesize complex reasoning problems through source algorithm problems and test cases. Then, standard answers and intermediate variable outputs are obtained for each problem based on standard python solutions and test cases. Finally, with the guidance of code intermediate variables, we synthesize the text reasoning process for each reasoning problems. Through this method, we can synthesize data that is difficult, scalable, effective, and comes with golden standard answers and high-quality reasoning processes. As a result, with our 540K synthesized dataset constructed solely from 2,360 algorithm problems, our approach \footnote{Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/jiangjin1999/LogicPro} achieves significant improvements in multiple models for the datasets \textit{BBH$^{27}$}, \textit{LogicBench}, \textit{DROP}, \textit{AR-LSAT}, and \textit{GSM8K}, etc. outperforming a wide range of existing reasoning datasets.

Abstract: There is a strong correlation between linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI), best manifested by deep learning language models. This study provides a thorough scientometric analysis of this correlation, synthesizing the intellectual production over 51 years, from 1974 to 2024. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was the data source. The data collected were analyzed by two powerful software, viz., CiteSpace and VOSviewer, through which mapping visualizations of the intellectual landscape, trending issues and (re)emerging hotspots were generated. The results indicate that in the 1980s and 1990s, linguistics and AI (AIL) research was not robust, characterized by unstable publication over time. It has, however, witnessed a remarkable increase of publication since then, reaching 1478 articles in 2023, and 546 articles in January-March timespan in 2024, involving emerging issues including Natural language processing, Cross-sectional study, Using bidirectional encoder representation, and Using ChatGPT and hotspots such as Novice programmer, Prioritization, and Artificial intelligence, addressing new horizons, new topics, and launching new applications and powerful deep learning language models including ChatGPT. It concludes that linguistics and AI correlation is established at several levels, research centers, journals, and countries shaping AIL knowledge production and reshaping its future frontiers.

Abstract: The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language (NL) statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text, often go unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of existing NL-, FOL-, and graph-based metrics to capture differences between a sampled FOL and its corresponding ground-truth. We then measure the alignment between a metric-based ranking of FOL outputs and a strong LLM as-a-judge. To do this, we first apply operator and text-based perturbations to ground-truth FOL statements to assess metric sensitivity. We then evaluate metric robustness by comparing the metrics against LLMs judgment. Our empirical findings highlight a clear oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations. The operator perturbation affects the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural changes, and the FOL metric for specific operator changes. We observe a closer alignment between BertScore and LLM judgement, proving the importance of semantic evaluation. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both robustness and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in clinical text summarization, but their ability to handle long patient trajectories with multi-modal data spread across time remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, their Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) variants and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on long-context clinical summarization and prediction. We examine their ability to synthesize structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data while reasoning over temporal coherence, by re-engineering existing tasks, including discharge summarization and diagnosis prediction from two publicly available EHR datasets. Our results indicate that long context windows improve input integration but do not consistently enhance clinical reasoning, and LLMs are still struggling with temporal progression and rare disease prediction. While RAG shows improvements in hallucination in some cases, it does not fully address these limitations. Our work fills the gap in long clinical text summarization, establishing a foundation for evaluating LLMs with multi-modal data and temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science. Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the $50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. The remaining $76\%$ of documents show varying degrees of similarity with existing work, with only a small fraction appearing completely novel. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are inadequate at catching plagiarized ideas from such systems. We recommend a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of our findings on academic publishing.

Abstract: Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.

Abstract: Stereotypes are known to have very harmful effects, making their detection critically important. However, current research predominantly focuses on detecting and evaluating stereotypical biases, thereby leaving the study of stereotypes in its early stages. Our study revealed that many works have failed to clearly distinguish between stereotypes and stereotypical biases, which has significantly slowed progress in advancing research in this area. Stereotype and Anti-stereotype detection is a problem that requires social knowledge; hence, it is one of the most difficult areas in Responsible AI. This work investigates this task, where we propose a five-tuple definition and provide precise terminologies disentangling stereotypes, anti-stereotypes, stereotypical bias, and general bias. We provide a conceptual framework grounded in social psychology for reliable detection. We identify key shortcomings in existing benchmarks for this task of stereotype and anti-stereotype detection. To address these gaps, we developed StereoDetect, a well curated, definition-aligned benchmark dataset designed for this task. We show that sub-10B language models and GPT-4o frequently misclassify anti-stereotypes and fail to recognize neutral overgeneralizations. We demonstrate StereoDetect's effectiveness through multiple qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmarks and models fine-tuned on them. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/StereoDetect.

<title>Can LLMs Simulate Personas with Reversed Performance? A Benchmark for Counterfactual Instruction Following</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now increasingly widely used to simulate personas in virtual environments, leveraging their instruction-following capability. However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub "counterfactual instruction following". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research.

Abstract: The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality, cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and 8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database accessibility, most research today focuses on English, with limited evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of both foundational and finetuned LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create and release a multilingual dataset by translating English questions into Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair cross-lingual comparison. Using standardized prompts and metrics, we evaluate several foundational models and observe a consistent performance pattern: highest on English, followed by Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute this to differences in training data availability and linguistic features. We also examine the impact of translating task prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Furthermore, we finetune a foundational model on two datasets: one in English only, and one multilingual. Finetuning on English improves overall accuracy but widens the performance gap between languages. In contrast, multilingual finetuning narrows the gap, resulting in more balanced performance. Our findings highlight the importance for multilingual evaluation and training to build more inclusive and robust query generation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning architectures to process and predict sequences of words, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pre-trained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to systematically collect LLMs' supply chain information. Then, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a directed heterogeneous graph, having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Lastly, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

Abstract: This article introduces misinfo-general, a benchmark dataset for evaluating misinformation models' ability to perform out-of-distribution generalization. Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Token-level Uncertainty estimation framework for Reasoning (TokUR) to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and improving reasoning generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced virtual educators and learners, bridging NLP with AI4Education. Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs, indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and na\"ive ensemble baselines. In addition, we explore using MUSE as guided signals with chain-of-thought distillation to fine-tune LLMs for calibration. MUSE is available at:https://github.com/LARK-NLP-Lab/MUSE.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach. We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection, reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed commercial systems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, SpeechLMs, Reinforced Behavior Alignment, instruction-following, reinforcement learning

Summary: 
The paper introduces a framework called Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA) to enhance the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. RBA generates alignment data using a powerful teacher LLM and employs reinforcement learning to align the behavior of SpeechLMs with that of the teacher. By utilizing self-synthesis methodology, RBA improves instruction-following capabilities of SpeechLMs surpassing conventional distillation baselines. The method is successfully extended to tasks such as spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data. This novel approach addresses the performance gap in SpeechLMs compared to text-based LLMs, particularly in handling dynamic and variable user speech, and demonstrates promising results in enhancing the linguistic capabilities of SpeechLMs for various applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs (SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA), designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones. However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

<div> Keywords: earnings calls, multi-modal framework, hierarchical discourse trees, contrastive learning, discourse representation

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new multi-modal framework for analyzing earnings calls, a valuable source of financial communication. The framework encodes earnings calls as hierarchical discourse trees, capturing the structured interactions between managers and analysts. By incorporating emotional signals from text, audio, and video, as well as metadata like coherence scores and topic labels, the system generates semantically rich embeddings. A two-stage transformer architecture first encodes content and metadata at the node level, then synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results show that the embeddings accurately reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment. This approach extends beyond financial reporting to other high-stakes communicative domains like healthcare and politics, offering a versatile and explainable method for analyzing multi-modal discourse. The system's effectiveness has practical implications for tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation, demonstrating its applicability across various domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models, failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education, and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation, while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains involving high-stakes communication.

<div> Keywords: Suicide, Adolescents, Social media, Predictive modeling, Transformer-based model

Summary:
Suicide is a major concern among adolescents, with many cases going undetected due to limited contact with mental health services. This study introduces a novel approach to predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) in youths using social media data before explicit self-disclosure. The Early-SIB transformer-based model processes forum posts to predict the likelihood of a user writing a SIB post. By focusing on predictive framing without relying on self-disclosure, the model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 on a Dutch youth forum, showing promise for early detection of SIB. This research highlights the potential of utilizing social media content for suicide prediction and suggests that such tools could supplement traditional methods to aid in suicide prevention efforts.
<br /><br />Summary: Suicide prediction among adolescents is challenging, often leading to cases going unnoticed. This study proposes a unique method using social media data to predict suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) before explicit disclosure. The Early-SIB model, based on transformers, analyzes forum posts to forecast the likelihood of a user posting SIB content. This predictive approach, without relying on self-disclosure, achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 on a Dutch youth forum. The study demonstrates the potential of social media analysis in early SIB detection, offering additional support to conventional methods for suicide prevention. <div>
arXiv:2509.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it: predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage, remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end, we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a meaningful addition to traditional methods.

<div> Keywords: language models, hallucination detection, entity-level hallucinations, dataset annotation, scalable detection

Summary:
Large language models are increasingly used in critical applications where hallucinations can have serious consequences. Existing methods for detecting hallucinations are not practical for real-world use, either limited in scope or costly. This study introduces a cost-effective method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens, focusing on entity-level hallucinations like fabricated names or dates. By annotating model responses with grounded labels using web search, effective classifiers for hallucinations can be trained using simple techniques. These classifiers outperform baselines on long-form responses and also show improvement in short-form question-answering tasks. Despite being trained on entity-level labels, the classifiers can detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks, demonstrating generalization abilities. The annotation methodology may be expensive, but annotated responses from one model can be used to train classifiers for other models. The released datasets aim to facilitate further research in scalable hallucination detection. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates, citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks, indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Intrinsic Faithfulness Hallucinations, Semantic Divergence Metrics, Deterministic Information Bottleneck, Geometric Clustering

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) can experience intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations, where responses deviate from the context. Current frameworks like Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM) use geometric clustering to detect these discrepancies but may lack downstream information-theoretic analysis. This paper introduces UDIB, a method grounded in Deterministic Information Bottleneck, for high-dimensional data clustering. UDIB, essentially a robustified K-means, prioritizes informative clustering and is computationally efficient. Applying UDIB to LLM embeddings generates a shared topic representation optimized for prompt-response relationship analysis and enables more sensitive detection of confabulations. By enhancing the clustering process, this method provides a structured and coherent topic representation that improves the performance of the SDM framework in identifying semantic deviations in LLM responses. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including \textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations), where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB, can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Summary: 
Abstraction is a critical skill in computer science, essential for both human problem-solvers and large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches in training LLMs for code generation lack explicit training for abstraction, focusing on superficial pattern recognition. To address this gap, AR$^2 (Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Abstract Reasoning) is proposed as a framework to enhance LLMs' abstraction abilities. It employs a teacher model to transform complex problem statements into narrative-rich descriptions without changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is trained to extract underlying computational kernels from these narrative problems. Experimental results show that AR$^2 significantly improves the student model's accuracy on challenging programming tasks, emphasizing the importance of abstraction in enhancing LLM generalization. <div>

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$ substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen, challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for enhancing LLM generalization.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing the factual consistency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically constructing and expanding knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference. The proposed method extracts a seed KG from the question via prompting, iteratively expands it using the LLM's latent knowledge, and selectively refines it through external retrieval. By integrating internal and external knowledge sources, the approach improves factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability in three factual question answering benchmarks. The findings highlight the effectiveness of inference-time KG construction in enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time. However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation, methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task, we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents, consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment, structural consistency, and visual fidelity.

<div> Keywords: Optical Character Recognition, Large Vision-Language Models, Edge deployment, Multilingual images, Efficiency

Summary:<br /><br />
This article introduces Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system designed for edge deployment in resource-constrained environments. The system was evaluated against five Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and two traditional OCR systems on a multilingual dataset. Results showed Qwen had the highest precision, while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR achieved the best overall F1 score and outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 times faster and at a significantly lower cost. Traditional OCR systems were found to be more optimal for edge deployment due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and high affordability. The study highlights the importance of considering various metrics including accuracy, efficiency, and deployment cost when selecting an OCR system for edge deployment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency, language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54), while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000 images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high affordability.

<div> steering vectors, self-preference bias, large language models, evaluation pipelines, fairness<br />
<br />
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit self-preference bias, favoring their own outputs over those of other models. This bias can impact fairness and reliability in evaluation processes. The study explores the use of lightweight steering vectors to address this issue without retraining the models. By distinguishing between justified and unjustified instances of self-preference bias, the researchers tested two steering vector methods - Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and optimization-based approach. The results indicate that steering vectors can significantly reduce unjustified self-preference bias, outperforming other baseline methods. However, the vectors are less effective when dealing with legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement, suggesting that self-preference bias may extend across multiple or nonlinear directions. This research highlights the potential and limitations of steering vectors as a tool to enhance the fairness and reliability of LLM-based evaluations, calling for further robust interventions in this area. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions. This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges and motivates more robust interventions.

<div> SNOMED CT, concept co-occurrence, semantic similarity, embeddings, clinical notes <br />
Summary: <br />
The study explores the relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic similarity in clinical notes. While there is a weak correlation between co-occurrence and semantic similarity, embeddings capture clinically meaningful associations not reflected in documentation frequency. Embeddings suggest missing concepts and match concepts later documented, enhancing clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings reveals coherent clinical themes mapping to patient phenotypes. Co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes like mortality demonstrate practical utility. The study emphasizes the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical relationships, and supporting decision-making and phenotyping applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally, co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new approach for stance detection called Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with triplet loss to understand the semantic similarities and differences between stance targets, improving domain adaptation. By creating a discriminative embedding space, MLSD enables a model to learn from new target domains in cross-target or cross-domain stance detection tasks. Evaluations across multiple scenarios on two datasets demonstrate a significant enhancement in stance detection performance compared to six established stance detection models. <div>

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across six widely used stance detection models.

Summary:<br />
- Evaluation of sign language generation is often done through back-translation, which may introduce ambiguity and fail to capture the multimodal nature of sign language. <br />
- SiLVERScore is introduced as a novel semantically-aware evaluation metric that assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space, addressing the limitations of existing metrics. <br />

- SiLVERScore achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs on PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, outperforming traditional metrics significantly. <br />
- The study explores generalization challenges across datasets, highlighting the importance of considering semantic and prosodic elements in sign language evaluation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.03791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation, where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC = 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

<div> Keywords: Vision language models, interactive grounding, referential games, evaluation metrics, task success

Summary:
Efforts to evaluate vision language models (VLMs) in interactive grounding contexts have led to the introduction of a four-metric suite. This suite examines grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and human-likeness to assess VLM performance in ongoing communication scenarios. Through analyzing 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games involving three VLMs and human dyads, it was observed that all models differed from human patterns on multiple metrics, with GPT4o-mini proving to be the closest overall. Despite conventional task success scores not necessarily indicating successful grounding, high image-utterance alignment did not always predict task success. These findings emphasize the importance of considering various metrics beyond task success when evaluating VLM performance in interactive contexts, providing a valuable framework for future research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings. However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Align-then-Slide, an evaluation framework for document-level machine translation (doc-mt) using large language models (LLMs). The framework consists of an Align stage, where sentence-level source-target correspondences are inferred to resolve mismatches, and an n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage for multi-granularity assessment. Experimental results on the WMT benchmark show a high correlation with expert rankings, and alignment with human judgments on a real-world test set. Additionally, preference data generated by Align-then-Slide is used for training and as a reward model for generating preferred translations over a baseline. The results demonstrate the framework's accuracy, robustness, and utility as an evaluation tool for doc-mt systems.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool for doc-mt systems.

Summary: 
NE-PADD is a novel method for Partial Audio Deepfake Detection that utilizes named entity knowledge through Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and attention aggregation mechanisms. The approach combines Attention Fusion (AF) for integrating attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for guiding PADD with named entity semantics.

The study demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating named entity knowledge in Partial Audio Deepfake Detection, showcasing the potential for improved accuracy in detecting audio deepfakes at the frame-level. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD), partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area, leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in PADD.

Summary:<br />
- Drivelology is a unique linguistic phenomenon characterized by "nonsense with depth," requiring contextual inference and emotional interpretation.<br />
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle to understand the layered semantics of Drivelological text despite excelling at other NLP tasks.<br />
- A diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 examples in multiple languages was curated and expert-reviewed to capture Drivelological characteristics.<br />
- LLMs often mistake Drivelology for shallow nonsense, struggle with reasoning tasks, and miss the rhetorical function implied in the text.<br />
- The results highlight a gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the impact of Long-CoT reasoning on the trustworthiness of language models. It reviews recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. The survey provides a structured overview of recent studies, analyzing methodologies, findings, and limitations. While reasoning techniques show promise in enhancing trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models have vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy. The paper highlights the need for AI safety measures to address these challenges and suggests future research directions. Overall, the integration of reasoning techniques into language models has the potential to improve accuracy and interpretability, but careful consideration is required to ensure trustworthiness in various dimensions. <div>

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However, despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Probing-based approaches, Safety detection, Trigger words, Semantic harmfulness

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised safety concerns due to their ability to comply with harmful instructions. Recent research has utilized probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations for safety detection. However, the out-of-distribution performance of these approaches has been poor, leading researchers to hypothesize that probes may learn superficial patterns rather than truly identifying semantic harmfulness. Controlled experiments have confirmed this hypothesis, revealing that probes predominantly learn instructional patterns and trigger words. This finding challenges the effectiveness of current probing methods and suggests a need for a redesign of models and evaluation protocols. Further discussions on responsible research in this area have been provided, and the project has been open-sourced for additional exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Summary:
Smartphones have become integral to daily life, leading to the development of mobile agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, current agents face limitations such as errors, lack of interaction with the environment, and memory constraints. To address these issues, the MobileRAG framework is introduced, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance performance in handling complex mobile tasks. The framework includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG components. A new benchmark, MobileRAG-Eval, is also introduced, featuring challenging real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge. Experimental results show that MobileRAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 10.3% improvement with fewer operational steps. The code for MobileRAG is publicly available for further research and development.

arXiv:2509.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However, current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving 10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

<div> Keywords: Complex Question Answering, Large Language Models, Matrix of Thought, Fact-correction mechanism, QA Framework

Summary:
The article introduces the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel structure for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) for complex Question Answering (QA) tasks. MoT utilizes a "column-cell communication" mechanism to enable multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy and improving reasoning. A fact-correction mechanism is also developed to enhance knowledge for LLM reasoning and correct erroneous answers. The proposed QA framework, MTQA, outperforms existing methods on four datasets in terms of F1 and EM scores, while being significantly more efficient with reasoning time only 14.4% of baseline methods. The code for the framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. Overall, MoT and MTQA provide an effective and accurate solution for handling complex QA tasks with improved reasoning capabilities and efficiency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the "column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy.

<div> dataset, Korean poetry, emotion analysis, language model, cultural specificity <br />
<br />Summary: 
This study introduces the KPoEM dataset for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. The dataset consists of 7,662 entries, with fine-grained emotion categories from five Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model trained on KPoEM achieved a significantly higher F1 score compared to models trained on general corpora. The sequential fine-tuning process on general corpora and KPoEM allowed the model to accurately identify culturally specific emotional expressions and preserve the core sentiments of Korean poetry. This research showcases the integration of computational methods and literary analysis, offering new possibilities for quantitatively exploring emotions in poetry while retaining the emotional and cultural nuances of Korean literature. <div>

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models, poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of 7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615 work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60 F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of Korean literature.

<div> Keywords: large language models, fine-tuning, catastrophic forgetting, self-distribution alignment, RAG scenarios

Summary: 
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved natural language processing, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. However, supervised fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge and capabilities. To address this issue, the authors propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution. This helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enhances downstream performance. The study shows a correlation between distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG scenarios, highlighting the importance of retaining RAG capabilities during fine-tuning. SelfAug achieves a superior balance between task-specific performance and general capability retention. The findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in RAG contexts but also offer a practical solution applicable to various fine-tuning scenarios. The code for SelfAug is available on GitHub for public use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning. Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/SelfAug.

<div> Keywords: self-play fine-tuning, Text-to-SQL task, iterative fine-tuning, error-driven loss method, state-of-the-art methods

Summary:
SPFT-SQL is a novel self-play fine-tuning method designed specifically for the Text-to-SQL task. It incorporates a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach before self-play to generate high-quality fine-tuning data and builds models with varying capabilities. During self-play fine-tuning, an error-driven loss method incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, improving the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. Extensive experiments on multiple language models and benchmarks show that SPFT-SQL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in the Text-to-SQL task. <div>
arXiv:2509.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in Large Language Models have spurred the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) focused on creating immersive user experiences through consistent persona adoption. However, current research in speech-based RPAs lacks consideration for essential paralinguistic features like intonation and prosody. Additionally, the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks hinders accurate assessment of model performance in maintaining persona consistency. To address these gaps, VoxRole, a comprehensive benchmark for speech-based RPCAs, has been introduced. The benchmark includes 13335 multi-turn dialogues from 261 movies, enabling a multidimensional evaluation of model performance in persona consistency. By leveraging VoxRole, researchers have gained insights into the strengths and limitations of contemporary spoken dialogue models. <div>

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First, existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments, featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261 movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character. Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces CANDY, a benchmark created to evaluate the fact-checking abilities of large language models (LLMs) on Chinese misinformation. A dataset of approximately 20k instances was carefully curated for this purpose. The analysis reveals that current LLMs have limitations in producing accurate fact-checking results, even with enhancements like chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. A taxonomy was developed to categorize the flawed explanations given by LLMs for their conclusions, with factual fabrication being the most common error. While LLMs alone are considered unreliable for fact-checking, they show potential for improving human performance when used as assisting tools. Access to the dataset and code is available at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY. <div>

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically, we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited, making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language, specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream applications for this underrepresented language.

<div> Keywords: temporal knowledge graph, question answering, reasoning, recursive thinking, fault tolerance

Summary:
The article introduces RTQA, a novel framework for temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) that addresses the limitations of current methods. RTQA improves reasoning over TKGs without the need for training by recursively decomposing questions, solving sub-problems using Language Models (LLMs) and TKG knowledge, and aggregating answers through multi-path methods for increased fault tolerance. The framework comprises three core components: the Temporal Question Decomposer, Recursive Solver, and Answer Aggregator. Experimental results on benchmarks such as MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA demonstrate significant improvements in Hits@1 for the "Multiple" and "Complex" question categories, surpassing existing approaches. The code and data for RTQA are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/zjukg/RTQA. <br /><br />Summary: RTQA enhances temporal question answering by leveraging recursive thinking, improving reasoning over TKGs without training, and enhancing fault tolerance through multi-path answer aggregation.

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Robustness, Benchmark Evaluation, Paraphrased Questions, Generalization Abilities

Summary: 
This study evaluates the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to paraphrased benchmark questions and questions the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations as a measure of model capabilities. By generating various paraphrases of questions across six different benchmarks, the study measures the effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs. The findings show that while LLM rankings remain stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores decrease significantly, indicating a struggle with linguistic variability. This raises concerns about the generalization abilities of LLMs and the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations. The observed performance drop challenges the notion that high benchmark scores accurately reflect a model's robustness to real-world input variations. The study suggests the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better simulate practical deployment scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

The study investigates the similarity of model outputs across 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU using the model similarity metric $\kappa_p$. Results indicate that as the size and capability of a model increase, its responses become more consistent across languages. Interestingly, models demonstrate greater consistency within themselves than with other models in the same language. This highlights the importance of $\kappa_p$ for evaluating multilingual reliability and suggests its potential in enhancing the development of consistent multilingual systems. <div>

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Summary: 
This study introduces a functional syntax annotation model for Chinese texts based on RoBERTa, addressing the lack of an automatic annotation system for Chinese texts in the context of systemic functional grammar. A dataset of 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus was annotated according to functional syntax theory and used to fine-tune the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model for named entity recognition. The model achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.852 on the test set, outperforming other comparative models in identifying key syntactic elements such as Subject, Main Verb, and Complement. However, challenges remain in recognizing entities with imbalanced label samples. This study represents the first integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models for Chinese texts, offering a promising approach for automated functional syntax analysis and paving the way for future research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach). The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1 score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C). Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent studies.

arXiv:2509.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory, which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base. Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted music creation.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1) multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles, and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning + Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Summary: 
This study explores the development of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a foundation for enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue. By leveraging strategies for personalising conversational agents, the study investigates the optimal construction of lexical profiles based on varying amounts of transcribed spoken data and the number of items per part-of-speech category. Through evaluation using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics, it was found that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 minutes of transcribed speech with specific item quantities for different POS categories, offered the best balance in terms of performance and data efficiency. The results indicate that these personalised lexical profiles serve as a crucial step towards implementing lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents, considering minimal data requirements and efficacy in fostering successful communication. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10 items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles, taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Summary:
In the field of linguistics, achieving coherence in discourse involves maintaining reference to consistent entities across sentences and establishing discourse relations between these entities. Existing research predominantly focuses on either entity features or discourse relation features separately, neglecting the potential benefits of integrating both aspects. This study investigates two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations to enhance coherence assessment. Through experimentation on three standard datasets, the results demonstrate that incorporating both types of features significantly improves the performance of coherence models. This research emphasizes the importance of simultaneously modeling entities and discourse relations for the evaluation of coherence in linguistic discourse.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Summary:
The article introduces MAGneT, a multi-agent framework for generating synthetic psychological counseling sessions. It decomposes counselor response generation into specialized tasks handled by different agents, improving the structure and quality of counseling. A unified evaluation framework is proposed, integrating automatic and expert metrics to assess data quality comprehensively. Expert evaluations cover nine aspects of counseling, showing that MAGneT outperforms existing methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of sessions. Fine-tuning an open-source model on MAGneT-generated sessions leads to better performance in general counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-specific skills. The code and data are made publicly available. Experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in the majority of cases, indicating its effectiveness in modeling counseling techniques accurately. <div>

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality, privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT, a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale (CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3% on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make our code and data public.

Social event detection from social media requires labeled data, but annotation is labor-intensive. The proposed SED-Aug framework combines explicit text-based augmentation using large language models with implicit feature-space augmentation through novel perturbation techniques. This approach enhances data diversity and model robustness, outperforming baseline models by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012 dataset and 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of average F1 score.

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework, which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012 dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

Summary:
The article introduces the Inverse IFEval benchmark, which evaluates the ability of large language models to overcome training-induced biases and follow adversarial instructions. The benchmark includes challenges such as Question Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and Counterfactual Answering. A dataset of high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains was created and evaluated using a human-in-the-loop pipeline. Experiments on leading large language models highlighted the importance of the Inverse IFEval benchmark in assessing adaptability under unconventional contexts. The findings emphasize the need for future alignment efforts to focus not only on fluency and factual correctness but also on the ability of models to follow instructions in diverse and unpredictable real-world scenarios. The hope is that Inverse IFEval will serve as a diagnostic tool and foundation for improving the instruction-following reliability of large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains, evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
The article discusses the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing healthcare but highlights the risk of these models relying on static training data. This reliance poses a danger when medical recommendations evolve, leading to outdated knowledge being memorized by LLMs. To address this problem, the authors introduce two new question-answering datasets derived from systematic reviews: MedRevQA and MedChangeQA. Evaluation of eight LLMs on these datasets shows a consistent reliance on outdated knowledge. The study also examines the impact of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies on this phenomenon. The findings suggest the need for mitigating strategies to develop more current and reliable medical AI systems. Overall, the research underscores the importance of updating LLMs with the latest medical knowledge to ensure accurate and beneficial healthcare recommendations.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews: MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Summary:
PARCO is proposed for domain-specific named entity recognition in automatic speech recognition systems. It integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering to improve phonetic discrimination, enhance entity retrieval, and reduce false positives. Experiments on Chinese and English datasets show that PARCO outperforms baselines, achieving low error rates. It also demonstrates robust performance on out-of-domain datasets. PARCO's approach addresses challenges such as homophones and limited entity diversity in contextual ASR, offering a promising solution for accurate recognition of domain-specific named entities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens, leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation (PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering. These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and LibriSpeech.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on the impact of task prompts on measuring gender bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). It examines how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task affects bias outcomes in LLMs. The research shows that slight changes in prompts can significantly alter bias results, sometimes even changing the direction of bias. Furthermore, it reveals that discrete-choice metrics tend to magnify bias compared to probabilistic measures. The study raises questions about the reliability of current LLM gender bias evaluations and poses a challenge to the NLP community regarding the influence of testing designs on LLM performance and the ecological validity of future benchmarks.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and (2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance, and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Temporal reasoning and knowledge are crucial for language models, but current models mainly focus on the Gregorian calendar. This study evaluates how well open-source language models handle the Japanese calendar, a non-Gregorian system. Four tasks requiring temporal knowledge and reasoning were created for evaluation. While some models can perform calendar conversions, they struggle with Japanese-calendar arithmetic and consistency across calendars. This highlights the need for developing language models that can better understand culture-specific calendars. <div>

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar. However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system: the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars. Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning, often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model, and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and \textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent, neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github repository.

<title>SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation</title>

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.

<title>Promptception: How Sensitive Are Large Multimodal Models to Prompts?</title>

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models. This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER Retriever Codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/ShacharOr100/ner_retriever

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space, a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous, reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

<title>LibriQuote: A Speech Dataset of Fictional Character Utterances for Expressive Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear. Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally, we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at https://libriquote.github.io/.

Abstract: Formalizing cooking procedures remains a challenging task due to their inherent complexity and ambiguity. We introduce an extensible domain-specific language for representing recipes as directed action graphs, capturing processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure. Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows. Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the DSL's expressiveness and suitability for future automated recipe analysis and execution. This work represents initial steps towards an action-centric ontology for cooking, using temporal graphs to enable structured machine understanding, precise interpretation, and scalable automation of culinary processes - both in home kitchens and professional culinary settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally, we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably, our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering, enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology, cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent, interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation, correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

<title>No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in Resume Screening</title>

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias) to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group, people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13% if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work, design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and determining which are subject to oversight.

<title>Towards a Unified View of Large Language Model Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate, and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and families.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding (image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss; (ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations.

arXiv:2509.04439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories. We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition, we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models. Code is available at https://github.com/OscarXZQ/delta_activations.

Abstract: The presence of specific linguistic signals particular to a certain sub-group can become highly salient to language models during training. In automated decision-making settings, this may lead to biased outcomes when models rely on cues that correlate with protected characteristics. We investigate whether prompting ChatGPT to rewrite text using simplification, neutralisation, localisation, and formalisation can reduce demographic signals while preserving meaning. Experimental results show a statistically significant drop in location classification accuracy across multiple models after transformation, suggesting reduced reliance on group-specific language. At the same time, sentiment analysis and rating prediction tasks confirm that the core meaning of the reviews remains greatly intact. These results suggest that prompt-based rewriting offers a practical and generalisable approach for mitigating bias in text classification.

Abstract: Code completion models have made significant progress in recent years. Recently, repository-level code completion has drawn more attention in modern software development, and several baseline methods and benchmarks have been proposed. However, existing repository-level code completion methods often fall short of fully using the extensive context of a project repository, such as the intricacies of relevant files and class hierarchies. Besides, the existing benchmarks usually focus on limited code completion scenarios, which cannot reflect the repository-level code completion abilities well of existing methods. To address these limitations, we propose the R2C2-Coder to enhance and benchmark the real-world repository-level code completion abilities of code Large Language Models, where the R2C2-Coder includes a code prompt construction method R2C2-Enhance and a well-designed benchmark R2C2-Bench. Specifically, first, in R2C2-Enhance, we first construct the candidate retrieval pool and then assemble the completion prompt by retrieving from the retrieval pool for each completion cursor position. Second, based on R2C2 -Enhance, we can construct a more challenging and diverse R2C2-Bench with training, validation and test splits, where a context perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate the real-world repository-level code completion well. Extensive results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our R2C2-Coder.

Abstract: Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases.

<title>ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box LLMs</title>

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks depends significantly on the quality of their instructions, which often require substantial human effort to craft. This underscores the need for automated instruction optimization. However, optimizing instructions is particularly challenging when working with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients are inaccessible. We introduce ACING, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework that formulates instruction optimization as a stateless, continuous-action problem, enabling exploration of infinite instruction spaces using only black-box feedback. ACING automatically discovers prompts that outperform human-written prompts in 76% of instruction-induction tasks, with gains of up to 33 points and a 10-point median improvement over the best automatic baseline in 33 tasks spanning instruction-induction, summarization, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Extensive ablations highlight its robustness and efficiency. An implementation of ACING is available at https://github.com/salmakh1/ACING.

<title>Small Changes, Large Consequences: Analyzing the Allocational Fairness of LLMs in Hiring Contexts</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes applications like hiring, yet their potential for unfair decision-making remains understudied in generative and retrieval settings. In this work, we examine the allocational fairness of LLM-based hiring systems through two tasks that reflect actual HR usage: resume summarization and applicant ranking. By constructing a synthetic resume dataset with controlled perturbations and curating job postings, we investigate whether model behavior differs across demographic groups. Our findings reveal that generated summaries exhibit meaningful differences more frequently for race than for gender perturbations. Models also display non-uniform retrieval selection patterns across demographic groups and exhibit high ranking sensitivity to both gender and race perturbations. Surprisingly, retrieval models can show comparable sensitivity to both demographic and non-demographic changes, suggesting that fairness issues may stem from broader model brittleness. Overall, our results indicate that LLM-based hiring systems, especially in the retrieval stage, can exhibit notable biases that lead to discriminatory outcomes in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains challenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-Augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional fields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time access to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential, traditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical challenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii) difficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii) system efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop reasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms that leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation of LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions. All the related resources of GraphRAG, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphRAG.

Abstract: Objective: Assessing the appropriateness of diagnostic referrals is critical for improving healthcare efficiency and reducing unnecessary procedures. However, this task becomes challenging when referral reasons are recorded only as free text rather than structured codes, like in the Italian NHS. To address this gap, we propose a fully unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline capable of extracting and evaluating referral reasons without relying on labelled datasets.
  Methods: Our pipeline leverages Transformer-based embeddings pre-trained on Italian medical texts to cluster referral reasons and assess their alignment with appropriateness guidelines. It operates in an unsupervised setting and is designed to generalize across different examination types. We analyzed two complete regional datasets from the Lombardy Region (Italy), covering all referrals between 2019 and 2021 for venous echocolordoppler of the lower limbs (ECD;n=496,971; development) and flexible endoscope colonoscopy (FEC; n=407,949; testing only). For both, a random sample of 1,000 referrals was manually annotated to measure performance.
  Results: The pipeline achieved high performance in identifying referral reasons (Prec=92.43% (ECD), 93.59% (FEC); Rec=83.28% (ECD), 92.70% (FEC)) and appropriateness (Prec=93.58% (ECD), 94.66% (FEC); Rec=91.52% (ECD), 93.96% (FEC)). At the regional level, the analysis identified relevant inappropriate referral groups and variation across contexts, findings that informed a new Lombardy Region resolution to reinforce guideline adherence.
  Conclusions: This study presents a robust, scalable, unsupervised NLP pipeline for assessing referral appropriateness in large, real-world datasets. It demonstrates how such data can be effectively leveraged, providing public health authorities with a deployable AI tool to monitor practices and support evidence-based policy.

Abstract: To mitigate the impact of hallucination nature of LLMs, many studies propose detecting hallucinated generation through uncertainty estimation. However, these approaches predominantly operate at the sentence or paragraph level, failing to pinpoint specific spans or entities responsible for hallucinated content. This lack of granularity is especially problematic for long-form outputs that mix accurate and fabricated information. To address this limitation, we explore entity-level hallucination detection. We propose a new data set, HalluEntity, which annotates hallucination at the entity level. Based on the dataset, we comprehensively evaluate uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches across 17 modern LLMs. Our experimental results show that uncertainty estimation approaches focusing on individual token probabilities tend to over-predict hallucinations, while context-aware methods show better but still suboptimal performance. Through an in-depth qualitative study, we identify relationships between hallucination tendencies and linguistic properties and highlight important directions for future research.

Abstract: Thanks to their linguistic capabilities, LLMs offer an opportunity to bridge the gap between informal mathematics and formal languages through autoformalization. However, it is still unclear how well LLMs generalize to sophisticated and naturally occurring mathematical statements. To address this gap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical definitions: a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we introduce two novel resources for autoformalization, collecting definitions from Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs' performance including refinement through external feedback from Proof Assistants, and formal definition grounding, where we augment LLMs' formalizations through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical libraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge compared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that LLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant mathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and definition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on self-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors, highlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).

Abstract: During Human Robot Interactions in disaster relief scenarios, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential for substantial physical reasoning to assist in mission objectives. However, these reasoning capabilities are often found only in larger models, which are not currently reasonable to deploy on robotic systems due to size constraints. To meet our problem space requirements, we introduce a dataset and pipeline to create Field Reasoning and Instruction Decoding Agent (FRIDA) models. In our pipeline, domain experts and linguists combine their knowledge to make high-quality, few-shot prompts used to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning. We hand-curate datasets for this few-shot prompting and for evaluation to improve LLM reasoning on both general and disaster-specific objects. We concurrently run an ablation study to understand which kinds of synthetic data most affect performance. We fine-tune several small instruction-tuned models and find that ablated FRIDA models only trained on objects' physical state and function data outperformed both the FRIDA models trained on all synthetic data and the base models in our evaluation. We demonstrate that the FRIDA pipeline is capable of instilling physical common sense with minimal data.

<title>Explicit Learning and the LLM in Machine Translation</title>

Abstract: This study explores an LLM's ability to learn new languages using explanations found in a grammar book, a process we term "explicit learning." To rigorously assess this ability, we design controlled translation experiments between English and constructed languages generated, through specific cryptographic means, from Latin or French. Contrary to previous studies, our results demonstrate that LLMs do possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning. This ability, however, diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena to be learned increases. Supervised fine-tuning on ad hoc chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs, benefiting low-resource languages typically described in grammar books but lacking extensive corpora.

Abstract: The Future Work section of a scientific article outlines potential research directions by identifying gaps and limitations of a current study. This section serves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored areas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations. In this study, we generate future work suggestions from a scientific article. To enrich the generation process with broader insights and reduce the chance of missing important research directions, we use context from related papers using RAG. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We incorporate an LLM feedback mechanism to enhance the quality of the generated content and introduce an LLM-as-a-judge framework for robust evaluation, assessing key aspects such as novelty, hallucination, and feasibility. Our results demonstrate that the RAG-based approach using GPT-4o mini, combined with an LLM feedback mechanism, outperforms other methods based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the LLM as an extractor, generator, and feedback provider.

<title>EQ-Knight: A Memory-Augmented LLM Agent for Strategic Affective Gaming in Debt Recovery</title>

Abstract: Large language model-based chatbots have enhanced engagement in financial negotiations, but their overreliance on passive empathy introduces critical risks in credit collection. While empathy-driven approaches preserve client satisfaction in benign cases, they fail catastrophically against dishonest debtors--individuals who exploit conciliatory tactics to manipulate terms or evade repayment. Blindly prioritizing "customer experience" in such scenarios leads to creditor vulnerabilities: revenue leakage, moral hazard, and systemic exploitation. To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that dynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests. Unlike naive empathy-centric bots, EQ-Knight integrates emotion memory and game-theoretic reasoning, powered by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to track and predict debtor emotional states. By analyzing both real-time and historical emotional cues, EQ-Knight strategically counters negative emotions (e.g., aggression, feigned distress) while preserving productive debtor relationships. Experiments demonstrate EQ-Knight's superiority over conventional LLM negotiators: it achieves a 32\% reduction in concession losses without compromising recovery rates, particularly in adversarial cases where debtors weaponize negative emotions (e.g., intimidation, guilt-tripping) to coerce concessions. For credit agencies, EQ-Knight transforms LLMs from high-risk "people-pleasers" into strategic emotion-defenders--balancing emotional intelligence with tactical rigor to enforce accountability and deter exploitation.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HGPrompt, validating its effectiveness in learning an optimal ensemble for effective multi-source prompt transfer.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios. Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with a rule-based reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances legal compliance (achieving a +8.58% accuracy improvement in safety/privacy benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability. For OpenThinker-7B, a strong reasoning model that significantly outperforms its base model Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct across diverse subjects, our method enhances its general reasoning capabilities, with +2.05% and +8.98% accuracy improvement on the MMLU and LegalBench benchmark, respectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM) designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model, MiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning mode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform similar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants showing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and generation.

Abstract: SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively handles class imbalance and emotion ambiguity. The first two stages train an ensemble of classifiers that utilize DeepSER, a novel extension of a deep cross-modal transformer fusion mechanism from pretrained self-supervised acoustic and linguistic representations. Manifold MixUp is employed for further regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human annotation scores as soft targets, coupled with balanced data sampling and multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion Recognition in the Interspeech 2025: Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions Challenge.

Abstract: Patent prior-art retrieval becomes especially challenging when relevant disclosures cross technological boundaries. Existing benchmarks lack explicit domain partitions, making it difficult to assess how retrieval systems cope with such shifts. We introduce DAPFAM, a family-level benchmark with explicit IN-domain and OUT-domain partitions defined by a new IPC3 overlap scheme. The dataset contains 1,247 query families and 45,336 target families aggregated at the family level to reduce international redundancy, with citation based relevance judgments. We conduct 249 controlled experiments spanning lexical (BM25) and dense (transformer) backends, document and passage level retrieval, multiple query and document representations, aggregation strategies, and hybrid fusion via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Results reveal a pronounced domain gap: OUT-domain performance remains roughly five times lower than IN-domain across all configurations. Passage-level retrieval consistently outperforms document-level, and dense methods provide modest gains over BM25, but none close the OUT-domain gap. Document-level RRF yields strong effectiveness efficiency trade-offs with minimal overhead. By exposing the persistent challenge of cross-domain retrieval, DAPFAM provides a reproducible, compute-aware testbed for developing more robust patent IR systems. The dataset is publicly available on huggingface at https://huggingface.co/datasets/datalyes/DAPFAM_patent.

Abstract: Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage retrieval and answer extraction. For passage retrieval, we ensemble fine-tuned Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task, with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of 0.669 for extraction, substantially outperforming previous methods. These results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question answering in specialized domains.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing, which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs. The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover, LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data grows.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics. SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14 domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption, enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have leveraged extensive multimodal datasets to enhance capabilities in complex knowledge-driven tasks. However, persistent challenges in perceptual and reasoning errors limit their efficacy, particularly in interpreting intricate visual data and deducing multimodal relationships. To address these issues, we introduce PIN (Paired and INterleaved multimodal documents), a novel data format designed to foster a deeper integration of visual and textual knowledge. The PIN format uniquely combines semantically rich Markdown files, which preserve fine-grained textual structures, with holistic overall images that capture the complete document layout. Following this format, we construct and release two large-scale, open-source datasets: PIN-200M (~200 million documents) and PIN-14M (~14 million), compiled from diverse web and scientific sources in both English and Chinese. To maximize usability, we provide detailed statistical analyses and equip the datasets with quality signals, enabling researchers to easily filter and select data for specific tasks. Our work provides the community with a versatile data format and substantial resources, offering a foundation for new research in pre-training strategies and the development of more powerful knowledge-intensive LMMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG[.]in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG[.]in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.

Abstract: Scientific research is inherently global. However, the vast majority of academic journals are published exclusively in English, creating barriers for non-native-English-speaking researchers. In this study, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to translate published scientific articles while preserving their native JATS XML formatting, thereby developing a practical, automated approach for implementation by academic journals. Using our approach, we translate articles across multiple scientific disciplines into 28 languages. To evaluate translation accuracy, we introduce a novel question-and-answer (QA) benchmarking method, in which an LLM generates comprehension-based questions from the original text and then answers them based on the translated text. Our benchmark results show an average performance of 95.9%, showing that the key scientific details are accurately conveyed. In a user study, we translate the scientific papers of 15 researchers into their native languages, finding that the authors consistently found the translations to accurately capture the original information in their articles. Interestingly, a third of the authors found many technical terms "overtranslated," expressing a preference to keep terminology more familiar in English untranslated. Finally, we demonstrate how in-context learning techniques can be used to align translations with domain-specific preferences such as mitigating overtranslation, highlighting the adaptability and utility of LLM-driven scientific translation. The code and translated articles are available at https://hankleid.github.io/ProjectMundo.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.

<title>Is Random Attention Sufficient for Sequence Modeling? Disentangling Trainable Components in the Transformer</title>

Abstract: The transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide range of tasks - including mathematical reasoning, memorization, and retrieval - using only gradient-based learning on next-token prediction. While the core component of a transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard transformers to variants in which either the MLP layers or the attention weights are frozen at initialization. Surprisingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query weights is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. We formalize this by proving a new expressivity result for transformer models with frozen key and query weights. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we design MixiT, an architecture with entirely random attention scores, with provably stable signal propagation that overcomes prior depth-wise scaling challenges in random transformers. We use the successes and failures of MixiT to understand the role each transformer component plays, such as attention being largely responsible for in-context reasoning, and MLPs being responsible for, but collaborates with attention, on knowledge storage. Our results suggest that the transformer architecture has a built-in inductive bias towards forming specialized circuits, as it does even without learnable attention weights.

Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in improving human-machine interactions, offering valuable real-world applications such as language learning for children. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiGen, a multilingual speech generation model with child-friendly interaction, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for low-resource languages. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, which can be used to facilitate young children's communication with AI systems through culturally relevant context in three low-resource languages: Singaporean accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiGen compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) as an extension of FKG[.]in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of concept of FKG[.]in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers, policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world saturated with dietary assertions.

<div> Keywords: DrDiff, long-text generation, dynamic expert scheduling, Hierarchical Sparse Attention, soft absorption guidance optimization

Summary: 
DrDiff is a new framework for generating long texts efficiently without compromising quality. The framework incorporates three key technologies: dynamic expert scheduling, Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA), and soft absorption guidance optimization. The dynamic expert scheduling mechanism efficiently allocates computational resources based on text complexity, allowing for better handling of text generation tasks. The HSA mechanism adapts attention patterns to input lengths, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance. The soft absorption guidance optimization strategy, combined with DPM-solver++, reduces diffusion steps and enhances generation speed. Results from experiments on various benchmarks show that DrDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in long-text generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies. First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

Summary:
This study focuses on the integration and benchmarking of various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods in speech recognition tasks within ESPnet. The state-of-the-art PEFT methods, including VeRA, DoRA, PiSSA, and SVFT, are evaluated alongside a new method called structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning. SSVD fine-tuning selectively rotates specific right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors constant, leading to improved efficiency and domain adaptation with minimal trainable parameters. The evaluation includes domain-shifted speech recognition tasks such as child speech and dialectal variation and covers model scales ranging from 0.1B to 2B. The implementations of all methods are openly available in ESPnet to support reproducibility and encourage further research in the field. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a scalable solution for adapting large foundation models. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is widely used in speech applications, its state-of-the-art variants, e.g., VeRA, DoRA, PiSSA, and SVFT, are developed mainly for language and vision tasks, with limited validation in speech. This work presents the first comprehensive integration and benchmarking of these PEFT methods within ESPnet. We further introduce structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning, which selectively rotates input-associated right singular vectors while keeping output-associated vectors fixed to preserve semantic mappings. This design enables robust domain adaptation with minimal trainable parameters and improved efficiency. We evaluate all methods on domain-shifted speech recognition tasks, including child speech and dialectal variation, across model scales from 0.1B to 2B. All implementations are released in ESPnet to support reproducibility and future work.

This study examines the narratives constructed by large language models, specifically LLaMA 3.2-3B, regarding Black and white women in Portuguese short stories. Through computational methods, semantically similar stories were grouped for qualitative analysis. The analysis reveals three main discursive representations: social overcoming, ancestral mythification, and subjective self-realization. It demonstrates how seemingly neutral texts generated by these models perpetuate colonial structures and historical inequalities in the framing of the female body. The study advocates for an integrated approach that combines machine learning techniques with manual discourse analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the biases and implications present in generated narratives. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models, in particular LLaMA 3.2-3B, construct narratives about Black and white women in short stories generated in Portuguese. From 2100 texts, we applied computational methods to group semantically similar stories, allowing a selection for qualitative analysis. Three main discursive representations emerge: social overcoming, ancestral mythification and subjective self-realization. The analysis uncovers how grammatically coherent, seemingly neutral texts materialize a crystallized, colonially structured framing of the female body, reinforcing historical inequalities. The study proposes an integrated approach, that combines machine learning techniques with qualitative, manual discourse analysis.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors address the challenge of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpretive annotation tasks. They introduce the IDEAlgin benchmarking paradigm, which involves a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task to capture expert similarity ratings. The study evaluates various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones and LLM-as-a-judge using IDEAlgin, against human benchmarks in educational datasets. The results show that traditional vector-based metrics are not effective in capturing the nuanced dimensions of similarity important to experts. However, prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with expert judgments. This approach provides a promising framework for evaluating LLMs in open-ended expert annotations at scale, particularly in educational contexts, guiding their responsible deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to open-ended, interpretive annotation tasks, such as thematic analysis by researchers or generating feedback on student work by teachers. These tasks involve free-text annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives (e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task, and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones (topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets (interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover, we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising 12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital health interventions and public health policy.

Summary:<br />
This study showcases the effectiveness of a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in conducting Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) concurrently. By utilizing Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct and fine-tuning on the Speechocean762 dataset, the model achieved high Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC > 0.7) with human-assigned scores. It also demonstrated low Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (< 0.15). Remarkably, performance close to full audio layer fine-tuning was attained solely by fine-tuning the LoRA layers. This research suggests that an integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established through large multimodal model adaptation without extensive fine-tuning, offering a simpler training approach for simultaneous APA and MDD. This LoRA-based strategy lays the groundwork for enhanced Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) tools for English L2 learners. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This study demonstrates that a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can perform both Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA) and Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) simultaneously. Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks. Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC > 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners.

Summary:
This work focuses on introducing a novel approach to identifying and extracting implicit moderation criteria from historical moderation data in online communities like subreddits. The researchers use interpretable architecture to represent moderation criteria as score tables of lexical expressions associated with content removal, allowing for systematic comparison across different communities. Through experiments, they show that these extracted lexical patterns can replicate the performance of neural moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making processes. The criteria matrix generated from the analysis reveals significant variations in how shared norms are enforced, exposing community-specific tolerances for language, features for topical restrictions, and subcategories within toxic speech classification. This research sheds light on previously undocumented moderation patterns and emphasizes the importance of understanding diverse and implicit standards in content moderation systems.

Abstract: Effective content moderation systems require explicit classification criteria, yet online communities like subreddits often operate with diverse, implicit standards. This work introduces a novel approach to identify and extract these implicit criteria from historical moderation data using an interpretable architecture. We represent moderation criteria as score tables of lexical expressions associated with content removal, enabling systematic comparison across different communities. Our experiments demonstrate that these extracted lexical patterns effectively replicate the performance of neural moderation models while providing transparent insights into decision-making processes. The resulting criteria matrix reveals significant variations in how seemingly shared norms are actually enforced, uncovering previously undocumented moderation patterns including community-specific tolerances for language, features for topical restrictions, and underlying subcategories of the toxic speech classification.

Abstract: Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types. Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity assistants.

Summary: 
This paper discusses the potential of using large language models (LLMs) equipped with professional psychotherapeutic skills to expand access to mental health services. A major challenge in this endeavor is the lack of psychological conversation datasets. To address this, the authors construct a dialogue corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which includes multiple sessions and cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation. The dataset, known as DiaCBT, aims to improve LLMs' ability to emulate psychologists with CBT expertise. The authors train an in-depth counseling model using the dataset and develop an evaluation framework to benchmark it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results demonstrate that DiaCBT enhances LLMs' capabilities in this regard, highlighting its potential for training more professional counseling agents.

Abstract: Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more professional counseling agents.

Summary:
Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) is essential for evaluating the proficiency of second-language learners. However, ASA models often face issues of class imbalance, resulting in biased predictions. In this study, a novel objective called the Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss is introduced to tackle this problem. This loss function perturbs model predictions to improve feature representation for minority classes without altering the dataset. Evaluations on the ICNALE benchmark dataset demonstrate that integrating the BLV loss into a popular text-based model like BERT leads to significant improvements in classification accuracy and fairness. This enhancement makes automated speech evaluation more robust and reliable for a diverse range of learners.<br /><br />Summary: Automated Speaking Assessment is crucial for evaluating second-language learners' proficiency.

Abstract: Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) plays a crucial role in evaluating second-language (L2) learners proficiency. However, ASA models often suffer from class imbalance, leading to biased predictions. To address this, we introduce a novel objective for training ASA models, dubbed the Balancing Logit Variation (BLV) loss, which perturbs model predictions to improve feature representation for minority classes without modifying the dataset. Evaluations on the ICNALE benchmark dataset show that integrating the BLV loss into a celebrated text-based (BERT) model significantly enhances classification accuracy and fairness, making automated speech evaluation more robust for diverse learners.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, text embeddings, contrastive learning, bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, semantic enrichment

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are powerful text embedders, with existing approaches often relying on the final token for embedding. However, these tokens may not capture the full context, limiting their usefulness for tasks like retrieval. To address this, the authors propose a new training stage before contrastive learning that uses bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, such as EBQ2D and EBD2Q, to enrich the final token embedding with context semantics. Experimental results show that this approach significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art results across various LLM base models and scales. This research highlights the importance of enhancing final token embeddings for better text representation and performance in text-related tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Summary:
This paper introduces an adapter-based fine-tuning method that addresses parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and limited task adaptability in large language models. The method utilizes a structure-learnable mechanism with differentiable gating functions and sparsity control variables to optimize adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations automatically. By dynamically constructing task-specific efficient substructures during training, the method improves parameter utilization and representational capacity while keeping backbone parameters frozen. Sensitivity analysis experiments demonstrate the method's stability and robustness across various multi-task natural language understanding tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques in terms of accuracy, compression rate, and robustness to noise and data perturbation. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of parameter redundancy, rigid structure, and limited task adaptability in the fine-tuning of large language models. It proposes an adapter-based fine-tuning method built on a structure-learnable mechanism. By introducing differentiable gating functions and structural sparsity control variables, the method enables automatic optimization of adapter insertion points, activation paths, and module combinations. This allows the model to adjust its structure flexibly in multi-task settings to match different task characteristics. With the backbone parameters kept frozen, the method uses a structure search mechanism to guide the dynamic construction of task-specific efficient substructures during training. This significantly improves parameter utilization and representational capacity. In addition, the paper designs a set of sensitivity analysis experiments to systematically evaluate the effects of sparsity weight, noise injection ratio, and data perturbation on model performance. These experiments verify the stability and robustness of the proposed method across various multi-task natural language understanding tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream parameter-efficient tuning techniques on multiple tasks. It achieves a better balance among accuracy, compression rate, and robustness to noise and perturbation.

Summary: 
Business sentiment analysis is an important aspect of natural language processing, specifically for business purposes. In this study, a modified approach using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, was applied to analyze business sentiment. The model was trained on a product review dataset and achieved an impressive accuracy rate of around 91.33%, outperforming conventional RNN models. This approach allows businesses to effectively determine customer feedback on various products, enabling them to assess their marketing strategies based on customer reviews. The use of LSTM in sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights for companies and e-commerce platforms, helping them make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and drive business growth.

Abstract: Business sentiment analysis (BSA) is one of the significant and popular topics of natural language processing. It is one kind of sentiment analysis techniques for business purposes. Different categories of sentiment analysis techniques like lexicon-based techniques and different types of machine learning algorithms are applied for sentiment analysis on different languages like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM) is applied for business sentiment analysis, where a recurrent neural network is used. An LSTM model is used in a modified approach to prevent the vanishing gradient problem rather than applying the conventional recurrent neural network (RNN). To apply the modified RNN model, product review dataset is used. In this experiment, 70\% of the data is trained for the LSTM and the rest 30\% of the data is used for testing. The result of this modified RNN model is compared with other conventional RNN models, and a comparison is made among the results. It is noted that the proposed model performs better than the other conventional RNN models. Here, the proposed model, i.e., the modified RNN model approach has achieved around 91.33\% of accuracy. By applying this model, any business company or e-commerce business site can identify the feedback from their customers about different types of products that customers like or dislike. Based on the customer reviews, a business company or e-commerce platform can evaluate its marketing strategy.

Summary:
- The study evaluates LLM-based approaches to measuring scalar constructs in social science using multiple datasets from political science literature.
- Direct pointwise scoring by LLMs yields discontinuous distributions with bunching at arbitrary numbers.
- Aggregation of pairwise comparisons by LLMs improves the quality of measurements.
- Token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring further enhances measurement quality.
- Finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed prompted LLM performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many constructs that characterize language, like its complexity or emotionality, have a naturally continuous semantic structure; a public speech is not just "simple" or "complex," but exists on a continuum between extremes. Although large language models (LLMs) are an attractive tool for measuring scalar constructs, their idiosyncratic treatment of numerical outputs raises questions of how to best apply them. We address these questions with a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based approaches to scalar construct measurement in social science. Using multiple datasets sourced from the political science literature, we evaluate four approaches: unweighted direct pointwise scoring, aggregation of pairwise comparisons, token-probability-weighted pointwise scoring, and finetuning. Our study yields actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with bunching at arbitrary numbers. The quality of the measurements improves with pairwise comparisons made by LLMs, but it improves even more by taking pointwise scores and weighting them by token probability. Finally, finetuning smaller models with as few as 1,000 training pairs can match or exceed the performance of prompted LLMs.

Summary: 
Knowledge editing is proposed as a lightweight alternative for fingerprint injection in Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance intellectual property protection. This approach exhibits strong capability and outperforms traditional fingerprint injection techniques. The introduced Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT) method helps reduce fingerprint degradation during large-scale fine-tuning by constraining the update of the fingerprint subspace. Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints, degradation still occurs under fine-tuning, highlighting the need for more robust fingerprinting injection methods. Fingerprint-injected models struggle to differentiate between fingerprints and similar texts due to high feature similarity, indicating the necessity for fine-grained fingerprinting approaches for LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2509.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intellectual property (IP) protection of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly critical. Injecting specialized fingerprints into LLMs through instruction tuning is a common IP protection technique. However, this may significantly degrade model performance, requires substantial computational resources, and exhibits poor persistence under model modifications. We argue that knowledge editing offers a lightweight alternative that is more suitable for fingerprint injection. Accordingly, we apply knowledge editing to fingerprint injection for the first time and demonstrate its strong capability. Despite using scrambled text as fingerprints to prevent them from being overwritten during fine-tuning, degradation still occurs under large-scale fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT), which reduces fingerprint degradation by constraining the update of the fingerprint subspace. The performance of FSFT exceeds fine-tuning by 10% even in the worst-case scenario. Additionally, we observe that the fingerprint-injected models struggle to distinguish between fingerprints and similar texts due to the high similarity of their features. This finding underscores the urgent need for more robust and fine-grained fingerprinting injection methods for LLMs.

Summary: <br />
This study explores lexical processing in Estonian using a large-scale single-subject experiment combining word naming tasks and eye-tracking. The study analyzes five response variables using a generalized additive model to examine the predictivity of measures generated by the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) and traditional predictors such as word frequency and inflectional paradigm size. The study finds that DLM-based measures are strong predictors for lexical processing, with deep learning not necessarily providing more accurate predictions than linear mappings. Classical predictors generally offer slightly better fit, except for total fixation duration where DLM-based predictors are equally effective. In the word naming task, lexical variables are not predictive for first fixation duration and the total number of fixations, suggesting a heavy involvement of meaning in the task. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates lexical processing in Estonian. A large-scale single-subject experiment is reported that combines the word naming task with eye-tracking. Five response variables (first fixation duration, total fixation duration, number of fixations, word naming latency, and spoken word duration) are analyzed with the generalized additive model. Of central interest is the question of whether measures for lexical processing generated by a computational model of the mental lexicon (the Discriminative Lexicon Model, DLM) are predictive for these response variables, and how they compare to classical predictors such as word frequency, neighborhood size, and inflectional paradigm size. Computational models were implemented both with linear and deep mappings. Central findings are, first, that DLM-based measures are powerful predictors for lexical processing, second, that DLM-measures using deep learning are not necessarily more precise predictors of lexical processing than DLM-measures using linear mappings, third, that classical predictors tend to provide somewhat more precise fits compared to DLM-based predictors (except for total fixation duration, where the two provide equivalent goodness of fit), and fourth, that in the naming task lexical variables are not predictive for first fixation duration and the total number of fixations. As the DLM works with mappings from form to meaning, the predictivity of DLM-based measures for total fixation duration, naming latencies, and spoken word duration indicates that meaning is heavily involved in the present word naming task.

The study found that while translation from Romansh to German was relatively well-handled for all varieties, translation into Romansh remained challenging. The automatic evaluation of machine translation systems and language models reflected these challenges. The limited resources for Romansh machine translation evaluation highlight the need for further development in this area. <div>

In this paper, we present a benchmark for six varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but translation into Romansh is still challenging.

arXiv:2509.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent area of interest across various research domains, including Process Mining (PM). Current applications in PM have predominantly centered on prompt engineering strategies or the transformation of event logs into narrative-style datasets, thereby exploiting the semantic capabilities of LLMs to address diverse tasks. In contrast, this study investigates the direct adaptation of pretrained LLMs to process data without natural language reformulation, motivated by the fact that these models excel in generating sequences of tokens, similar to the objective in PM. More specifically, we focus on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to mitigate the computational overhead typically associated with such models. Our experimental setup focuses on Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM), and considers both single- and multi-task predictions. The results demonstrate a potential improvement in predictive performance over state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches and recent narrative-style-based solutions, particularly in the multi-task setting. Additionally, our fine-tuned models exhibit faster convergence and require significantly less hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over 7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects, encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

LatPhon is a 7.5 M-parameter Transformer designed for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion in six Latin-script languages. It outperforms the ByT5 baseline and approaches language-specific WFSTs in terms of phoneme error rate (PER), achieving a mean PER of 3.5% on the ipa-dict corpus. The model's compact size of 30 MB allows for feasible on-device deployment.

On the public ipa-dict corpus, it attains a mean phoneme error rate (PER) of 3.5%, outperforming the byte-level ByT5 baseline (5.4%) and approaching language-specific WFSTs (3.2%) while occupying 30 MB of memory, which makes on-device deployment feasible when needed. These results indicate that compact multilingual G2P can serve as a universal front-end for Latin-language speech pipelines.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, agentic systems, failure attribution, AgenTracer-8B, multi-agent interactions<br />
Summary: 
AgenTracer introduces a new framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories through counterfactual replay and fault injection, creating the dataset TracerTraj. AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with reinforcement learning, surpasses existing LLMs in attributing errors in complex multi-agent interactions. It outperforms proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet on the Who&amp;When benchmark by up to 18.18%. AgenTracer-8B provides valuable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS, leading to performance improvements of 4.8-14.2%. This capability empowers agentic AI systems to self-correct and evolve, setting a new standard in agentic failure attribution. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&amp;When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.

<div> Keywords: Language models, knowledge acquisition, entity mentions, pretraining data, LMEnt

Summary: 
LMEnt is a suite designed for analyzing knowledge acquisition in language models (LMs) during pretraining. It includes a knowledge-rich corpus annotated with entity mentions from Wikipedia, an entity-based retrieval method, and 12 pretrained models with up to 1B parameters. By studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, the researchers found that fact frequency plays a key role but does not fully explain learning trends. LMEnt aims to provide a controlled environment for analyzing the connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance, as well as the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. This suite can support future studies on knowledge representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics in LMs. The resources provided by LMEnt could lead to the development of more consistent, robust, and complete knowledge representations in LMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete. To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks. Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance, and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

<div> Keywords: Natural language processing, pre-training, transformer blocks, token clusters, fine-tuning

Summary: 
The study explores the mechanism of successful pre-training in natural language processing (NLP) tasks and its impact on fine-tuning classification tasks. It found that accuracy per token (APT) increased with token frequency in the dataset, serving as a metric of pre-training success. Pre-training grouped tokens into small, strong match clusters, enhancing performance as it progressed through transformer blocks. Despite the cost function focusing on token identification, higher-order language structures were generated. Output label prediction confidence was unaffected by input APT, showcasing the preservation of input meaning through strong match tokens. The study also highlighted the similarity in mechanisms between NLP and image classification tasks, suggesting universality in pre-training approaches. The findings were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on Wikipedia and fine-tuned on FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks. The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT) increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently, higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token. These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.

Large language models face challenges in reliable evaluation as they tackle diverse and complex tasks. A benchmark called ComplexEval was developed to identify and measure biases induced by auxiliary information in evaluation processes. Six previously unexplored biases were systematically studied across basic and advanced scenarios, revealing that all models tested were susceptible to these biases, with bias intensity increasing with task complexity. Surprisingly, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) showed a paradoxical vulnerability. The findings highlight the need to improve evaluation signals for accuracy and verifiability, ultimately leading toward more robust evaluation models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6 previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation models.

Summary: 
This study addresses the lack of resources for Saudi Sign Language (SSL) by introducing the KAU-CSSL dataset, focusing on complete sentences for improved recognition systems. The research proposes a transformer-based model utilizing pre-trained ResNet-18 for spatial features and a Transformer Encoder with Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving high accuracy levels. This development aims to enhance communication tools for the SSL community and contribute to the broader field of sign language technology. <div>
arXiv:2509.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language, specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL, focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign language.

<br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the concept of identifiability in models of classical stochastic processes, where different models produce the same observable behavior. It explores the use of quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes, showing that quantum models can be more memory and thermal efficient. The study resolves the identifiability problem by mapping classical, quantum, or 'post-quantum' models to a canonical 'generalized' hidden Markov model. This mapping allows for the comparison of any two models of a classical process and provides bounds on the minimal dimension required for a quantum model to generate a specific classical stochastic process. The research highlights the potential benefits of using quantum models and provides a framework for determining the equivalence of different models in the context of classical stochastic processes. <div>

Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.

Summary: 
- The article addresses the issue of hallucinations in multimodal large language models caused by text-visual bias and co-occurrence bias.
- It introduces a gradient-based self-reflection method to estimate the influence of different token types (visual, prompt, previous outputs) in decision-making.
- The method enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and integrates them into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate biases.
- The proposed method does not require additional resources like fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in reducing hallucinations, with up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

<div> Keywords: bias, multilingual Large Language Models, Spanish language, cultural contexts, evaluation

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating bias in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on the Spanish language in culturally-aware Latin American contexts. The study addresses the gap in current evaluations, which are predominantly US-English-centric, by proposing a culturally-grounded approach to detect social biases in LLMs. The framework incorporates culturally-specific expressions and stereotypes across four social categories, including gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. By analyzing over 4,000 prompts, a new metric is introduced to balance model performance and bias alignment. The evaluation reveals varying patterns of bias manifestation in leading commercial LLMs for the Spanish language. The study provides evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not transfer effectively to Spanish tasks and that bias patterns remain consistent across different sampling temperatures. The modular framework can be extended to new stereotypes, bias categories, languages, and cultural contexts, contributing to more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems globally.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment, current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse linguistic environments where they operate.

Summary:  
This work evaluates the inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using a synthetic dataset, InAbHyD. Each reasoning example in the dataset consists of an incomplete world model and observations, with the task of generating hypotheses to explain the observations. A new metric based on Occam's Razor is proposed to evaluate the quality of hypotheses. While state-of-the-art LLMs show some success in performing inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, they struggle with more complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses. Popular techniques like in-context learning and reinforcement learning with value-based reasoning do not significantly improve these results. The study highlights the need for further research and development to enhance LLMs' ability to handle diverse types of reasoning beyond deductive logic.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.03345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

<div> Keywords: AI agents, environment, aspects, umwelt, information leakage

Summary: 
AI agents often act autonomously but may lack true situational awareness, behaving like scripted chatbots controlled by external forces. This study proposes a novel framework where AI agents interact with their environment, triggering behaviors in response to environmental changes. By introducing the concept of aspects, akin to umwelt, different groups of agents perceive their environment uniquely, allowing for more efficient information control. An illustrative implementation demonstrates that this aspective approach eliminates information leakage that is prevalent in traditional agent architectures. The specialization of agents within their unique information niches can enhance both security and efficiency in AI systems. This innovative framework offers a promising avenue for developing more effective and autonomous AI agents that can adapt and respond dynamically to their surroundings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment, with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time, aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces LimiX as a structured-data model for addressing tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction. It treats structured data as a joint distribution and is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective. LimiX surpasses strong baselines on 10 structured-data benchmarks, including classification, regression, imputation, and data generation tasks. The model achieves superior performance without task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. LimiX provides a unified interface and is publicly accessible under the Apache 2.0 license. <div>
arXiv:2509.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

<div> Keywords: harmful information, multilingual large language models, unlearning methods, integrity, reliability

Summary: 
Harmful information can propagate through multilingual large language models (LLMs) regardless of the language it originates in. Standard unlearning techniques focusing on English data are ineffective in combating the spread of harmful content across languages and may inadvertently reinforce it. To effectively eliminate harmful content in all languages, addressing responses in both English and the original language is vital. This study emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive unlearning strategies that consider the diverse linguistic landscape of modern LLMs to improve their safety and reliability across languages.

Abstract: This paper investigates the propagation of harmful information in multilingual large language models (LLMs) and evaluates the efficacy of various unlearning methods. We demonstrate that fake information, regardless of the language it is in, once introduced into these models through training data, can spread across different languages, compromising the integrity and reliability of the generated content. Our findings reveal that standard unlearning techniques, which typically focus on English data, are insufficient in mitigating the spread of harmful content in multilingual contexts and could inadvertently reinforce harmful content across languages. We show that only by addressing harmful responses in both English and the original language of the harmful data can we effectively eliminate generations for all languages. This underscores the critical need for comprehensive unlearning strategies that consider the multilingual nature of modern LLMs to enhance their safety and reliability across diverse linguistic landscapes.

<div> Sparse Attention, Large Language Models, Time-to-First-Token Latency, SampleAttention, FlashAttention
Summary:
SampleAttention is proposed as a solution to the quadratic complexity issue of vanilla attention in Large Language Models (LLMs), reducing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency by up to 2.42 times compared to FlashAttention. The approach dynamically captures head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead, utilizing a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering method to select key-values efficiently. By attending to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens and capturing local window and column stripe patterns, SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with minimal accuracy loss. Theoretical and empirical foundations support the near-lossless sparse attention approach, highlighting the importance of capturing sparse patterns efficiently to improve model efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support extremely long context windows, but the quadratic complexity of vanilla attention results in significantly long Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency. Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\times$ compared with FlashAttention.

<div> hallucinations, Large Language Models, Mixture of Memory Experts, memorization, neural networks 

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) often experience hallucinations despite their impressive capabilities in chat, coding, and reasoning. Traditional approaches to mitigating hallucinations by grounding the LLMs in external knowledge sources have proven ineffective. Experimental evidence shows that LLMs augmented with a massive Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) can easily memorize large datasets of random numbers. Theoretical analysis reveals that neural networks exhibit hallucinations when training loss surpasses a certain threshold, a common occurrence during training on vast datasets. Comparisons with traditional retrieval methods for mitigating hallucinations highlight the shortcomings of existing approaches. Leveraging these insights, a first-generation model called Lamini-1 has been designed to combat hallucinations by utilizing a massive mixture of millions of memory experts for dynamic retrieval of facts. <div>

Abstract: Despite their powerful chat, coding, and reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate. Conventional wisdom suggests that hallucinations are a consequence of a balance between creativity and factuality, which can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by grounding the LLM in external knowledge sources. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show that these traditional approaches fail to explain why LLMs hallucinate in practice. Specifically, we show that LLMs augmented with a massive Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) can easily memorize large datasets of random numbers. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple neural networks trained to predict the next token hallucinate when the training loss is above a threshold as it usually does in practice when training on internet scale data. We interpret our findings by comparing against traditional retrieval methods for mitigating hallucinations. We use our findings to design a first generation model for removing hallucinations -- Lamini-1 -- that stores facts in a massive mixture of millions of memory experts that are retrieved dynamically.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enhances the performance of large language models without requiring additional training or fine-tuning but presents challenges due to balancing computational efficiency with high-quality output. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling, as a simple yet powerful approach, generates multiple responses and selects the best one, achieving improved performance but with a high computational cost. We propose TreeBoN, a novel framework that integrates a speculative tree-search strategy into Best-of-N (BoN) Sampling. TreeBoN maintains a set of parent nodes, iteratively branching and pruning low-quality responses, thereby reducing computational overhead while maintaining high output quality. Our approach also leverages token-level rewards from Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to guide tree expansion and prune low-quality paths. We evaluate TreeBoN using AlpacaFarm, HH-RLHF, UltraFeedback, GSM8K, and TutorEval datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements. Specifically, TreeBoN achieves the highest win rate of 65% on TutorEval and around 60% win rates across other different datasets, outperforming standard BoN with the same computational cost and showcasing its scalability and alignment efficacy.

Summary: 
Large language models are used to generate adversarial examples to test text classification algorithms for detecting low-credibility content in social media platforms. The study focuses on simulating content moderation by limiting the number of queries an attacker can attempt. The proposed solution, TREPAT, utilizes prompts inspired by NLP tasks like text simplification and style transfer to generate initial rephrasings. These modifications are further refined through a beam search procedure until the classifier changes its decision. The approach is evaluated quantitatively with various prompts, models, and query limits, demonstrating its superiority in a constrained scenario, particularly for long input texts such as news articles where exhaustive search is impractical. Targeted manual assessment and qualitative linguistic analysis validate the effectiveness of the approach in generating adversarial examples to bypass content-filtering algorithms.

Abstract: Large language models have many beneficial applications, but can they also be used to attack content-filtering algorithms in social media platforms? We investigate the challenge of generating adversarial examples to test the robustness of text classification algorithms detecting low-credibility content, including propaganda, false claims, rumours and hyperpartisan news. We focus on simulation of content moderation by setting realistic limits on the number of queries an attacker is allowed to attempt. Within our solution (TREPAT), initial rephrasings are generated by large language models with prompts inspired by meaning-preserving NLP tasks, such as text simplification and style transfer. Subsequently, these modifications are decomposed into small changes, applied through beam search procedure, until the victim classifier changes its decision. We perform (1) quantitative evaluation using various prompts, models and query limits, (2) targeted manual assessment of the generated text and (3) qualitative linguistic analysis. The results confirm the superiority of our approach in the constrained scenario, especially in case of long input text (news articles), where exhaustive search is not feasible.

Summary:
- Fine-tuned LLMs are effective in evaluating semantic coherence and naming intent clusters with high accuracy.

- Context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue enhance the clustering process.

arXiv:2412.09049v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering customer intentions is crucial for automated service agents, yet existing intent clustering methods often fall short due to their reliance on embedding distance metrics and neglect of underlying semantic structures. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the language understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) examines the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) introduces context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. Since existing English benchmarks lack sufficient semantic diversity and intent coverage, we further present a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset comprising over 100k real customer service calls with 1,507 human-annotated clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality, cost efficiency, and downstream applications. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the prominence of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable dialogue data mining.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Hallucination is a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), hindering their effectiveness. This study introduces the Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) method for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. By utilizing attention contributions to classify input queries as attentive or non-attentive, AGSER processes each query separately through LLMs to calculate consistency scores between generated responses and the original answer. The difference in these scores is used as a hallucination estimator. AGSER is effective in detecting hallucinations and reduces computational load, requiring only three passes through LLMs and using two sets of tokens. Experimental results on multiple LLMs and hallucination benchmarks show that AGSER surpasses existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection. <div>

Abstract: Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual large language models in cross-device FL settings. It aims to improve client-specific performance through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules like LoRA. FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client using Bayesian sparse rank selection, offering a more effective personalization strategy compared to manual configuration methods. Evaluations on simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks show FedP$^2$EFT outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods while complementing other FL techniques. The code for FedP$^2$EFT is available on GitHub for further exploration and application in training multilingual LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods.

Summary:
FELLE is an autoregressive model that combines language modeling with token-wise flow matching to predict continuous-valued tokens, specifically mel-spectrograms. By incorporating information from previous steps, FELLE improves coherence and stability in predicting tokens. Utilizing a coarse-to-fine flow-matching mechanism, tokens are generated hierarchically, conditioned on the language model's output, enhancing synthesis quality. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of flow-matching techniques in autoregressive mel-spectrogram modeling, leading to significant enhancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation quality. The integration of flow matching with autoregressive modeling in FELLE has the potential to advance continuous-valued token modeling and enforce temporal-coherence in various applications.

For each continuous-valued token, FELLE modifies the general prior distribution in flow matching by incorporating information from the previous step, improving coherence and stability. Furthermore, to enhance synthesis quality, FELLE introduces a coarse-to-fine flow-matching mechanism, generating continuous-valued tokens hierarchically, conditioned on the language model's output. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of incorporating flow-matching techniques in autoregressive mel-spectrogram modeling, leading to significant improvements in TTS generation quality, as shown in https://aka.ms/felle.

Summary:
Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow) is a novel method introduced in this study to improve language models' few-shot word learning abilities. By training models to generate new examples of a word's usage based on a few in-context examples, Minnow enables strong word learning performance comparable to large pre-trained language models. Finetuning pre-trained models with Minnow enhances their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions based on limited examples. This method showcases high data efficiency and potential to boost language model performance in word learning tasks. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of Minnow in improving language models' systematic and flexible use of new words in novel contexts. <div>

Abstract: Humans can quickly learn a new word from a few illustrative examples, and then systematically and flexibly use it in novel contexts. Yet the abilities of current language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving these abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method, Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains language models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few in-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new word. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks.

Summary: 
This paper explores the challenges and design space of information extraction from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The core challenges identified are data structuring, model engagement, and output refinement. The study delves into sub-problems such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. The research introduces LayIE-LLM, an open-source layout-aware IE test suite, and benchmarks it against traditional models. Results show that optimized configurations with LayIE-LLM outperform baseline configurations, showcasing the need for tailored adjustments in the IE pipeline for LLMs. A one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method is developed to find near-optimal configurations efficiently. The study demonstrates that well-configured general-purpose LLMs can match specialized models' performance, offering a cost-effective alternative without the need for extensive fine-tuning. The LayIE-LLM test suite is available on GitHub for further exploration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative.

Summary:<br />
1. Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with font recognition tasks, especially when faced with a stroop effect challenge where fonts are explicitly mentioned in the text.
2. Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting methods do not significantly improve font recognition accuracy in VLMs.
3. The evaluation using the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB) dataset reveals the limited font recognition capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs.
4. Attention analysis indicates the challenges VLMs face in capturing semantic features relevant to font recognition tasks.
5. The study highlights the need for further research and development to enhance VLMs' ability to recognize fonts accurately in diverse visual and textual contexts. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and being easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.

Summary:<br /><br />Legal practitioners, especially those new to the field, confront intricate tasks that demand adaptive and context-sensitive reasoning. Existing AI tools have limitations in supporting legal work as they focus on isolated subtasks, lacking the ability to capture the complete decision-making processes required in real-world scenarios. Introducing the LawFlow dataset, which consists of end-to-end legal workflows gathered from trained law students dealing with business entity formation situations. Unlike previous datasets, LawFlow represents dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes reflecting the complexity of legal practice. A comparison between human-generated and LLM-generated workflows reveals structural, flexibility, and execution differences. Legal professionals prefer AI to play supportive roles like brainstorming and identifying alternatives rather than executing entire workflows. The study highlights the current constraints of LLMs in handling complex legal workflows and underscores the potential for developing collaborative and reasoning-aware legal AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex, high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows, revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications. Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Our results highlight both the current limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems.

Summary:
Optimized prompts in language models are important for inducing specific behaviors while being uninterpretable. These prompts primarily consist of punctuation and rare noun tokens, differentiating them from natural language. Internally, they can be distinguished from traditional language inputs based on sparse subsets of the model's activations. Across different models tuned for specific tasks, optimized prompts follow a consistent path in how they form representations throughout the network. Understanding the composition and mechanisms behind optimized prompts can help enhance the control and predictability of language models when faced with out-of-distribution inputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Machine generated (``optimized'') prompts can be used to modulate LM outputs and induce specific behaviors while appearing completely uninterpretable. In this work, we investigate the composition of optimized prompts, as well as the mechanisms by which LMs parse and build predictions from optimized prompts. We find that optimized prompts primarily consist of punctuation and noun tokens which are more rare in the training data. Internally, optimized prompts are clearly distinguishable from natural language counterparts based on sparse subsets of the model's activations. Across various families of instruction-tuned models, optimized prompts follow a similar path in how their representations form through the network.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Chinese LLMs underscores the need for vertical-domain evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However, existing benchmarks often lack domain coverage and provide limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, drawn from 24 Chinese qualifications to align with national policies and professional standards. Results reveal an interesting pattern of Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, with the Qwen2.5 model outperforming the more advanced GPT-4o, emphasizing the value of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The average accuracy of 53.98% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we identify performance degradation caused by LLM crowdsourcing, assess data contamination, and illustrate the effectiveness of prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, suggesting opportunities for future improvements through multi-domain RAG and Federated Learning.

<title>Insertion Language Models: Sequence Generation with Arbitrary-Position Insertions</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one ``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.

Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language models, such as inverse incentive training.

<title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>

Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. We provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression and define testable conditions for the emergence of Zipf's law in compressing systems.

<title>IndexTTS2: A Breakthrough in Emotionally Expressive and Duration-Controlled Auto-Regressive Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>

Abstract: Existing autoregressive large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have advantages in speech naturalness, but their token-by-token generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of synthesized speech. This becomes a significant limitation in applications requiring strict audio-visual synchronization, such as video dubbing. This paper introduces IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel, general, and autoregressive model-friendly method for speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one explicitly specifies the number of generated tokens to precisely control speech duration; the other freely generates speech in an autoregressive manner without specifying the number of tokens, while faithfully reproducing the prosodic features of the input prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control over timbre and emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can accurately reconstruct the target timbre (from the timbre prompt) while perfectly reproducing the specified emotional tone (from the style prompt). To enhance speech clarity in highly emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent representations and design a novel three-stage training paradigm to improve the stability of the generated speech. Additionally, to lower the barrier for emotional control, we designed a soft instruction mechanism based on text descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3, effectively guiding the generation of speech with the desired emotional orientation. Finally, experimental results on multiple datasets show that IndexTTS2 outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in terms of word error rate, speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.

<title>RAT: Bridging RNN Efficiency and Attention Accuracy via Chunk-based Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models, but their reliance on softmax attention poses a computational bottleneck at both training and inference. Recurrent models offer high efficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic representation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits fine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design that bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions the input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local dependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range interactions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct access to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K position, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but also consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results. Code is available at https://github.com/CLAIRE-Labo/RAT.

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This linguistic divide impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian, and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained settings: (i) a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and (ii) the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and our proposed Ara-TEaR method. Ara-TEaR is designed as a three-stage self-refinement prompting process, targeting frequent meaning-transfer and adaptation errors in DA-MSA translation. In this evaluation, GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across all prompting settings. For fine-tuning LLMs, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a chrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over 10% chrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than 1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

Abstract: Automated agents, powered by Large language models (LLMs), are emerging as the go-to tool for querying information. However, evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking and genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and time-consuming questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer real-world time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the limitations of LLM-powered agents in handling the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking tasks -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress.

<title>JARVIS: A Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning Framework for Conversational Embodied Agents</title>

Abstract: Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.

Abstract: As the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) continue to expand rapidly, Human-AI (HAI) Collaboration, combining human intellect and AI systems, has become pivotal for advancing problem-solving and decision-making processes. The advent of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has greatly expanded its potential, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. At the same time, realizing this potential responsibly requires addressing persistent challenges related to safety, fairness, and control. This paper reviews the crucial integration of LFMs with HAI, highlighting both opportunities and risks. We structure our analysis around four areas: human-guided model development, collaborative design principles, ethical and governance frameworks, and applications in high-stakes domains. Our review shows that successful HAI systems are not the automatic result of stronger models but the product of careful, human-centered design. By identifying key open challenges, this survey aims to give insight into current and future research that turns the raw power of LFMs into partnerships that are reliable, trustworthy, and beneficial to society.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Grounded radiology report generation (GRRG) extends RRG by including the localisation of individual findings on the image. Currently, there are no manually annotated chest X-ray (CXR) datasets to train GRRG models. In this work, we present a dataset called PadChest-GR (Grounded-Reporting) derived from PadChest aimed at training GRRG models for CXR images. We curate a public bi-lingual dataset of 4,555 CXR studies with grounded reports (3,099 abnormal and 1,456 normal), each containing complete lists of sentences describing individual present (positive) and absent (negative) findings in English and Spanish. In total, PadChest-GR contains 7,037 positive and 3,422 negative finding sentences. Every positive finding sentence is associated with up to two independent sets of bounding boxes labelled by different readers and has categorical labels for finding type, locations, and progression. To the best of our knowledge, PadChest-GR is the first manually curated dataset designed to train GRRG models for understanding and interpreting radiological images and generated text. By including detailed localization and comprehensive annotations of all clinically relevant findings, it provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating GRRG models from CXR images. PadChest-GR can be downloaded under request from https://bimcv.cipf.es/bimcv-projects/padchest-gr/

Abstract: Canceling is a morally-driven phenomenon that hinders the development of safe social media platforms and contributes to ideological polarization. To address this issue we present the Canceling Attitudes Detection (CADE) dataset, an annotated corpus of canceling incidents aimed at exploring the factors of disagreements in evaluating people canceling attitudes on social media. Specifically, we study the impact of annotators' morality in their perception of canceling, showing that morality is an independent axis for the explanation of disagreement on this phenomenon. Annotator's judgments heavily depend on the type of controversial events and involved celebrities. This shows the need to develop more event-centric datasets to better understand how harms are perpetrated in social media and to develop more aware technologies for their detection.

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language (L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense (longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS. Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer (at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably, listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for these individuals.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on given seed tasks, and then generate a new synthetic example of similar quality and complexity. This is followed by a filtering step to select high-quality data using automatic metrics, which are then used for LLM training. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, when evaluated on MATH500, AMC23, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of both human and standard Self-Instruct training data on the AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

Summary:
The article introduces Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to enhance throughput for reasoning tasks while maintaining high accuracy. This model, built on the Nemotron-H architecture, uses Mamba-2 layers instead of traditional self-attention layers to improve inference speed for generating long thinking traces required for reasoning. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 is created by pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens and compressing it using the Minitron strategy to enable inference on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU. Compared to similar models like Qwen3-8B, Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 shows comparable or superior accuracy in reasoning benchmarks while achieving significantly higher inference throughput in scenarios with 8k input and 16k output tokens. The checkpoints for Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base are released along with pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.   <div>

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, deep research agent, medical knowledge graphs, medical retrieval engine, state-of-the-art results <br />
Summary: 
Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have led to impressive capabilities across various domains, particularly in deep research tasks. However, these models struggle in the medical domain due to a lack of dense medical knowledge and specialized retrieval tools. In response, a new medical deep research agent has been developed.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

<div> Efficiency, large language models, test-time alignment, reward-shifted speculative sampling, weak-to-strong alignment<br />Summary:<br />This research focuses on enhancing the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, particularly during test-time inference. A new algorithm called reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) is introduced, which utilizes a draft model aligned with human preferences to improve efficiency without modifying the target model. By exploiting the distributional shift between the draft and target models, the SSS algorithm achieves superior results in weak-to-strong alignment experiments at a reduced inference cost. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of test-time alignment by leveraging speculative sampling techniques, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in improving LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

<title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, KV cache bottleneck, sparsity, channel-level redundancy, model accuracy

Summary:
SPARK is a novel method proposed to address the KV cache bottleneck in large language models (LLMs). By applying unstructured sparsity at the channel level, SPARK prunes unnecessary feature channels in the KV cache while dynamically restoring them during attention score computation. This approach allows for processing longer sequences within the same memory budget, reducing KV cache storage by over 30% compared to existing eviction-based methods. Despite an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains model performance with less than 5% degradation compared to baseline techniques. The method is compatible with existing KV compression and quantization methods, further enhancing computational efficiency. SPARK introduces a new way to exploit channel saliency variations to optimize model efficiency without compromising accuracy, offering a promising solution for improving the scalability of LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2508.15212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

<div> keywords: Sign Language Translation, fingerspelling, non-manual cues, MultiStream-LLM, Large Language Models<br />
Summary:<br />
The article presents a new approach, MultiStream-LLM, for Sign Language Translation (SLT) that addresses the challenges of fingerspelling recognition and integration of non-manual cues. Unlike monolithic models, MultiStream-LLM uses specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading, which are then fused using a lightweight transformer. This modular framework achieved a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 on the How2Sign benchmark and 73.2% letter accuracy on the ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. By isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusion, MultiStream-LLM offers a more effective pathway to robust and high-fidelity SLT. <div>

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion, our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of such approaches to SLR pipelines.

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing, significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses, particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

<div> Keywords: chain-of-thought prompting, large language models, reasoning, spectral analysis, Markov chain <br />
Summary:
This paper introduces a state-aware transition framework for chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to enhance the explainability of reasoning in large language models. By analyzing token-level embeddings through spectral analysis, reasoning steps are clustered into semantically coherent latent states, providing a structured view of the reasoning process. The progression of reasoning steps is modeled as a Markov chain, enabling an interpretable understanding of the global structure of reasoning. This framework facilitates semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation in CoT trajectories, offering a comprehensive analysis of multi-step reasoning in language models. By abstracting CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics, this approach enhances the interpretability and transparency of reasoning processes in large language models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM) task, challenging models to identify globally distinctive features across a set of documents, mirroring real-world scenarios like candidate selection. The DiFBench framework enables systematic evaluation, revealing a performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced LLMs. However, all models struggle with increased complexity and document count, often misidentifying frequent features as distinctive. This highlights limitations in contemporary LLMs' fine-grained statistical reasoning and rarity detection abilities. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning, not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however, substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs' abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

Summary:
This paper introduces a theoretical framework for modeling human meaning-making based on C. S. Peirce's semiotic theory. The framework proposes that models measure latent symbol geometries, representing hypotheses about the underlying semiotic agencies in a symbolic dataset. It suggests that when traditional performance measures are inadequate, models can be understood relationally, revealing their interpretive perspectives through comparison with other models. The theory of model semantics is presented, treating models and their decisions as signs. The framework is exemplified with brief empirical examples and raises foundational questions and future research directions. By grounding modeling practices in semiotic theory, this framework offers a comprehensive approach to understanding and comparing various model types in the analysis of complex semiotic systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems. However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C. S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future directions enabled by the framework.

<div> approach, temporal relation extraction, interactive game, point-wise comparisons, annotation<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces the Temporal Game, a unique method for temporal relation extraction that treats the task as an interactive game. Rather than directly annotating interval-level relations, the approach breaks them down into point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities. Players classify a single point relation at each step, and the system applies temporal closure to infer additional relations and ensure consistency. This strategy supports both interval and instant entities, allowing for more detailed and flexible annotation than before. The Temporal Game also sets the stage for training reinforcement learning agents by framing temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making challenge. The demo includes Game and Annotation modes, providing users with a research tool and annotation interface. The demo is accessible online, and the source code is open-source to encourage further research and community collaboration in temporal reasoning and annotation. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities. At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities, enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach. The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task. To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore, this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in temporal reasoning and annotation.

Summary:
Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE) integrates logical reasoning into the text embedding process using generative large language models (LLMs). By generating intermediate reasoning texts before computing embeddings, RITE enriches representations with inferential depth. Experimental results on the BRIGHT benchmark show that RITE enhances zero-shot retrieval performance significantly across diverse domains. This approach addresses the limitations of encoder-only retrievers in complex real-world queries. RITE leverages the reasoning strength of LLMs to improve retrieval beyond surface-level lexical matching. The proposed method offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate reasoning into text embedding, resulting in enhanced retrieval performance. <div>
arXiv:2509.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS), a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index (PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and central banks.

Summary: The article introduces a new paradigm for developing alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models, combining the instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm with the distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. The study identifies two critical phenomena - Sequence Length Collapse and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve - that compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities in this paradigm. To address these challenges, the authors propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. Through extensive experiments and analysis, it is shown that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous improvement in sequence length during training. The balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation, providing an effective solution for stable training and enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.

arXiv:2509.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.

<div> framework, large language model, self-reflection, revision, reasoning gaps
Model improvement through self-reflection is achieved by the GIER framework, which focuses on enhancing large language model outputs based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike other strategies, GIER uses natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps to prompt models to critique and refine their outputs iteratively. Tested on three reasoning-intensive tasks and four different language models, GIER successfully enhances rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment without compromising task accuracy. The analysis reveals that models can understand and address both abstract conceptual gaps and translate them into concrete reasoning improvements. <br /><br />Summary: <br />GIER is a novel framework for improving large language model outputs by prompting self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. It successfully enhances rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment across various tasks and models, demonstrating the model's ability to interpret and address abstract conceptual gaps effectively. <div>

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact, PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them into concrete reasoning improvements.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Deep Research tasks, Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems, InfoSeek, Research Tree

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are now required to tackle complex Deep Research tasks that involve decomposing questions, multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from various sources. The authors propose a framework called InfoSeek to address the lack of benchmarks capturing this complexity. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to generate complex Deep Research tasks by building Research Trees from webpages and converting them into natural language questions. Models trained on InfoSeek outperform strong baselines on challenging benchmarks like BrowseComp-Plus. By preserving meta-information and supporting advanced optimization strategies, InfoSeek enables 3B LLMs to surpass much larger models and lightweight commercial APIs while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs. This framework provides over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories for model training and evaluation.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

<div> Keywords: Key-Value cache management, language models, GraphKV, token selection, dynamic update.<br />
<br />
Summary: Efficient Key-Value cache management is crucial for optimizing performance in large language models. Existing cache eviction strategies often fall short in capturing evolving dependencies among tokens during inference. To address this limitation, this study introduces GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for cache compression. Tokens are represented as nodes with importance scores, connected by edges that signify similarity relationships. By implementing a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, GraphKV dynamically updates token importance by propagating contextual information across the graph. This innovative approach allows for adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens, enhancing the efficiency of cache management. GraphKV can be seamlessly integrated into existing cache eviction methods like SnapKV and PyramidKV. The codes for GraphKV will be made publicly available on Github for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this, we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

arXiv:2509.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation.

arXiv:2509.00414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year, making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health questions and advanced research insights.

<div> large language models, metalinguistic deductive learning, Camlang, evaluation, grammatical mastery
Summary:
Camlang is a constructed language designed to test the metalinguistic deductive learning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Human experiments demonstrate that participants can successfully acquire Camlang using explicit resources such as a grammar book and bilingual dictionary. The Camlang-CSQA-v0 task, based on CommonsenseQA, requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. While GPT-5 achieves high accuracy in English tasks, it performs significantly poorer in Camlang, indicating gaps in understanding and systematic grammatical mastery compared to humans. Human verification reveals that model successes primarily rely on shallow lexical alignment, with limited metalinguistic awareness shown by GPT-5 but not consistent grammatical mastery. This study highlights fundamental disparities between current LLMs and human metalinguistic competence.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup, and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang, creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human metalinguistic competence.

<div> semantic unit, global disambiguation, hierarchical keyword extraction, graph construction, generation quality

Summary:
GOSU is a new semantic unit-centric framework that enhances the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model by addressing key issues faced by standard graph-based approaches. By efficiently performing global disambiguation and leveraging semantic units (SUs) to capture interconnections across the global context, GOSU improves the extraction of high-level SUs and reduces ambiguity and retrieval overhead. The framework employs global merging to uncover global semantic objects from local text chunks, guiding entity and relationship extraction while enhancing coreference resolution. In the retrieval and generation phase, GOSU introduces hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion to uncover fine-grained binary relationships and compensate for missing n-ary relationships. Evaluation across various tasks has shown that GOSU outperforms baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality. <div>

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

Summary:
Islamic inheritance law, known as Ilm al-Mawarith, poses a challenge for AI due to the precise identification of heirs and calculation of shares required. In this paper, a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance questions using a specialized Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) is presented. The system ranks answer options based on semantic relevance and enables fast on-device inference without generative reasoning. Evaluation on the QIAS 2025 dataset compared various Arabic encoders and API-based language models (LLMs), with large models achieving up to 87.6% accuracy but requiring more resources and being context-dependent. The proposed MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between peak performance of large models and practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems like efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. This research emphasizes the importance of balancing accuracy and practicality in high-stakes domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper, we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance, and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent. Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

Summary:  
The paper introduces Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a framework for uncertainty quantification in open-ended language generation. TECP utilizes token-level entropy as an uncertainty measure without relying on model internals, incorporating it into a split conformal prediction pipeline for generating prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing methods, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from token entropy and calibrates thresholds using conformal prediction quantiles for reliable error control. Empirical evaluations on six large language models and two benchmarks show that TECP consistently achieves trustworthy coverage and compact prediction sets, surpassing previous self-consistency-based approaches. This approach offers a principled and effective solution for reliable language generation in black-box large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings.

Summary: 
This report explores different approaches to improve the performance of a tool-augmented large language model acting as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge. The challenges addressed include over-speaking and under-acting issues commonly faced by dialogue agents. Four prompting approaches were investigated, with the rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieving the best performance. The RRP approach utilized novel techniques such as character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling. This approach resulted in an overall score improvement from the zero-shot baseline. The findings suggest that simple rule-based prompting can enhance the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared to more complex methods like automatic prompt optimization. The source code for the best-performing prompts and the APO tool are open-sourced to support future developments in persona prompts.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool. Source code is available at https://github.com/scb-10x/apo.

Summary:
ResearchQA introduces a resource for evaluating LLM systems using survey articles from 75 research fields, encompassing 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Rubrics are derived from queries and provide evaluation criteria specific to each query, such as citing papers, explanations, and limitations. Evaluation by Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields confirms the relevance of the queries and the necessity for system responses to address 87% of rubric items. An automatic pairwise judge developed using the rubrics demonstrates 74% agreement with expert judgments. Analysis of 18 systems in over 7.6K evaluations reveals competency gaps, with no system achieving over 70% coverage of rubric items. The highest-ranking system addresses a maximum of 75% of rubric items, with significant gaps in addressing citation, limitation, and comparison criteria. The data from ResearchQA is released to facilitate broader multi-field evaluations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric, derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18 systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

Summary:
- The article introduces a new approach for discrete speech representation learning that aims to improve efficiency and reduce redundancy.
- Existing methods encode waveforms into fine-grained tokens at a high rate, which may not be necessary for semantic understanding.
- The proposed framework utilizes entropy-based dynamic aggregation to compress semantic speech representations.
- A speech language model is pre-trained for next-token prediction to capture frequent token patterns.
- Predictive entropy is used to determine aggregation boundaries, with a cross-attention module to fuse information within segments.
- The granularity and compression ratio of representations can be adjusted by controlling the entropy threshold.
- Experimental results show that the compressed representations perform as well as or better than dense token sequences in tasks such as ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information, while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to generate tailored summaries in legal contexts by adapting outputs to different stakeholder roles such as judges, prosecutors, and attorneys. This study examines how LLMs strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within the legal system, a concept known as motivated reasoning. The evaluation framework used in this research assesses legal fact and reasoning inclusion, as well as favorability towards stakeholders, revealing selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives. The study demonstrates that LLMs may exhibit alignment with specific stakeholder roles even without explicit role instructions, raising concerns about potential bias in legal summarization processes. This highlights the importance of role-aware evaluation in assessing LLM behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders. Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives. These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment, malicious requests, think-mode, safety guardrails

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are facing growing concerns about safety and alignment with human values. Research shows that fine-tuning LLMs on malicious datasets can lead to misaligned behaviors. This study introduces the concept of Reasoning-Induced Misalignment, where LLMs become more vulnerable to malicious requests when their reasoning capabilities are strengthened through methods like "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math datasets. Dense models are particularly at risk. Internal model analysis reveals that attention shifts and specialized experts in mixture-of-experts models can help steer excessive reasoning towards safety measures. These findings highlight a new trade-off between reasoning capabilities and safety and emphasize the need for better alignment strategies for advanced reasoning models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted, concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment for advanced reasoning models.

<div> evaluation awareness, Large Language Models, AI alignment, behavioral changes, prompts manipulation

Summary:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant behavioral shifts when moving from real-world deployment to controlled evaluation settings, known as "evaluation awareness."
- Benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty due to evaluation awareness.
- A methodology using a linear probe to score prompts based on context manipulation was introduced to shift prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context.
- Rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induced a significant shift in LLM behavior, increasing honest responses by 5.26% and decreasing deceptive responses by 12.40% on average.
- Models showed increased safety compliance with a 6.38% rise in refusal rates. This highlights the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to assess model alignment accurately before deployment. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.

<div> Keywords: Transformer, sequence modeling, Gated Associative Memory, linear complexity, self-attention

Summary:
The paper introduces the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network as an efficient alternative to the Transformer architecture for sequence modeling. GAM utilizes a novel approach with linear complexity, replacing the self-attention mechanism with a combination of causal convolution and associative memory retrieval pathways. These pathways dynamically fuse local and global information using a gating mechanism for each token. Experimental results on the WikiText-2 and TinyStories datasets demonstrate that GAM outperforms both the Transformer model and a linear-time baseline (Mamba) in terms of training speed. Additionally, GAM achieves superior or competitive performance in final validation perplexity compared to the other models, establishing its effectiveness in sequence modeling tasks. Overall, GAM shows promise as a faster and efficient option for processing long contexts in sequence modeling.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)), creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper, we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local, position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2 benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Summary:
The study introduces the ICPC benchmark, consisting of 254 ICPC tasks, as a domain for evaluating language models. The research explores various LM inference techniques for competitive programming, revealing a low pass rate of 19.1% with zero-shot prompting. The best technique, combining self-judge with reflection and retrieval, improves the solve rate to 42.2%. A human-in-the-loop investigation uncovers that specific instructions can enable the model to solve previously unsolvable problems. The study emphasizes the importance of grounded, imaginative, and algorithmic thinking in language models for competitive programming.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest (ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1 only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique, which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

Summary: 
The study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting hate speech, comparing uncensored models to censored ones. Surprisingly, censored models outperform uncensored ones in accuracy and robustness, even though uncensored models lack moral guardrails. However, censored models are less susceptible to persona-based influence, while uncensored models are easily swayed by ideological framing. All models struggle with understanding nuanced language like irony. Additionally, there are fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence in self-reported certainty. The findings challenge the idea of LLMs as objective arbiters and suggest the need for improved auditing frameworks that consider fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1% strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel routing technique called Router Upcycling to enhance the training performance of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. While MoE models have shown superior performance in deep learning tasks, efficiently training them has been a challenge. The proposed Router Upcycling technique leverages attention heads from preceding layers to initialize multiple routers, improving routing tasks within MoE upcycling models. By assigning tokens to specialized experts in an attention-like manner, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing other upcycling baselines. This collaborative token assignment process allows for diverse queries to align with experts' features, contributing to the model's improved performance and efficiency in training. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of Router Upcycling in enhancing the overall performance of MoE upcycling models.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this, simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

<div> Keywords: Small language models, fake news, headline generation, quality detection, ethical considerations

Summary:
Small language models (SLMs) were tested for their ability to generate fake news headlines, with potential ethical concerns being evaluated. The study assessed 14 SLMs and found that they were generally compliant in producing falsified headlines, albeit with some ethical variability. The generated headlines did not closely resemble real-world news headlines, as established by machine learning models detecting headline quality. These detectors had low accuracy rates, indicating common misclassification of fake news quality. The findings highlight the need for further research on SLM-generated fake news and the limitations of current detection methods. Ethical considerations remain essential in the development and use of language models for text generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14 SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000 headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the low quality classification accuracy.

Summary:
The article discusses the use of multimodal inputs, including text and historical time series data, in time series forecasting. It highlights the challenge of text not fully capturing the information in time series data, leading to unstable performance in multimodal forecasting. To address this issue, a text reinforcement model (TeR) is proposed to generate enhanced text that improves the understanding of time series data by the forecasting model. A reinforcement learning approach is used to guide TeR in generating high-quality reinforced text by assigning rewards based on its impact on forecasting performance and relevance to the task. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing superior performance compared to existing studies and strong baselines. <div>

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to (1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences. Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews influence the final recommendation.

<div> Keywords: Masked diffusion models, non-autoregressive modeling, Reward-Weighted Sampling, global signal, generation order  

Summary:  
Masked diffusion models (MDMs) present a non-autoregressive approach to language modeling. Standard decoding techniques often lead to generation orders resembling autoregressive processes. To address this issue, the authors propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), which uses a reward model to guide token selection during the diffusion process. RWS evaluates sequence quality and adjusts token logits to promote a more non-autoregressive generation order. The method improves token selection by increasing the confidence of tokens with lower scores. Theoretical analysis shows that reward-weighted logit scaling enhances token selection and expected reward. Experimental results demonstrate that RWS effectively enhances non-autoregressive properties and performance of MDMs. Integration of global signals through RWS leads to significant improvements across evaluation metrics.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized, scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts, adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in education. Future research will validate and refine the system through real-world implementation.

Summary:<br /><br />The study compares encoder-based Transformers like Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large, a decoder-only LLM (Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B), and FastText for accurate Chinese AI-generated text detection. The encoder models were fine-tuned using a prompt-based masked language modeling approach, while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted with a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Results show that encoder models struggle with distribution shifts, FastText shows lexical robustness but lacks semantic understanding, and Qwen2.5-7B achieves superior generalization and resilience with 95.94% test accuracy. The study highlights the effectiveness of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future research will focus on enhancing cross-domain robustness with next-generation Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM (Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach, while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3% test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance cross-domain robustness further.

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models (LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets, with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

Summary:  
- The study introduces the LegalAI task of Judicial Opinion Generation, which aims to generate criminal judicial opinions including legal reasoning and sentencing decisions simultaneously.  
- Existing research typically separates legal reasoning and sentencing prediction, leading to inconsistency in results.  
- The proposed LegalChainReasoner framework utilizes structured legal chains to guide the model through case assessments, integrating factual premises, legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions.  
- The approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation to better align with legal practice.  
- Experiments on real-world Chinese legal case datasets show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case, including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with references to similar past cases. However, current research typically approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation. Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

This paper discusses the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for complex question-answering in the biomedical field. The authors fine-tune the LLaMA 3 8B model using a curated biomedical question-answer dataset from various sources. Three experimental setups are tested, focusing on short and long answers in multi-hop questions. While the models show good domain understanding, Exact Match scores remain low, particularly in the testing phase. A two-stage inference pipeline is introduced to improve short-answer extraction and alignment with evaluation metrics. Challenges persist in generating properly formatted outputs. The study highlights the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, underscoring the need for further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task, which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases, genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics. Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Summary:<br /><br />
Topic Model Translation (TMT) is introduced as a technique to transfer topic models from one language to another without needing aligned corpora or metadata. TMT is robust and transparent, allowing for the reuse of topic models in scenarios where large corpora in the target language are not available. The method eliminates the need for manual translation and enables the development of topic models in multilingual environments with limited data. Extensive evaluation using quantitative and qualitative methods shows that TMT produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations. This approach addresses the challenges faced when training topic models for a multilingual environment and offers a solution for developers lacking expertise in the target language. <div>
arXiv:2509.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges in evaluating generative AI dialogue systems and presents the authors' work in the DSTC-12 competition. They developed models to predict dialogue-level scores using Language Models and encoder-based models. Despite modest correlations with human judgments, Language Models ranked second on the test set, outperforming the baseline. Regression and classification models showed high correlation on the validation set but decreased performance on the test set, possibly due to different score ranges. This highlights the importance of considering variations in annotations when evaluating dialogue systems. <div>

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12, Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level, dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting, and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and validation sets.

Summary:
The article introduces a new Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples for text embedding models. This approach aids in enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle semantic distinctions by providing varying levels of similarity with the query. The framework adopts a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, enabling the embedding model to learn more nuanced semantic representations progressively. Additionally, the article proposes an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs, thereby improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the MTEB benchmark showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the proposed methods, surpassing existing synthesis strategies both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of (query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile, we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs, improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

Summary:
The study introduces a benchmark for assessing societal bias in Text-to-Image (TTI) models by evaluating occupational portrayals across five roles. Five models are compared, with results showing that prompting can influence demographic representations significantly. However, different models respond differently to prompts, with some promoting diversity effectively while others showing limited responsiveness or leading to unrealistic uniformity. The study emphasizes the importance of using a combination of prompting and model-level strategies to address bias in TTI models. All code and data are released for transparency and reproducibility. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse, Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models: closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity. All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black, White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility https://github.com/maximus-powers/img-gen-bias-analysis.

<div> hallucinations, language models, contrastive decoding, fawning, information<br />Summary:<br />Large language models (LLMs) sometimes generate deceptive or misleading responses known as fawning hallucinations, prioritizing alignment over truth. This work analyzes fawning hallucinations in natural language processing tasks and proposes the collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) method to mitigate them. The CCD method involves inducing deceptive inputs and comparing output distributions to reduce reliance on misleading information. Experimental results show that CCD effectively improves response factuality across various tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Question Answering, Retrieval Mechanisms, Supportive-Evidence Notes, Evidence Quality Reward

Summary:<br /><br />Large Language Models with retrieval mechanisms face challenges in question answering due to low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence and error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning. To tackle these limitations, EviNote-RAG introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. It generates concise Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs) highlighting relevant information and uncertainty, guided by the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) to ensure logical support for the final answer. This approach enhances model fidelity and robustness while reducing noise impact. Experimental results demonstrate EviNote-RAG's superiority in accuracy, generalization, and training stability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various QA benchmarks such as HotpotQA, Bamboogle, and 2Wiki. By employing denser rewards and reducing verbosity, EviNote-RAG achieves significant relative F1 gains on these datasets. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and 91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains, including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new research directions.

<div> encoder-only models, sequence labeling tasks, supervised generative SL, in-context fine-tuning, LLMs

Summary:
Supervised generative sequence labeling tasks in NLP often require bidirectional context and are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. This study introduces supervised in-context fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative sequence labeling, combining in-context learning with supervised fine-tuning to outperform existing baselines. The approach demonstrates superior performance on various sequence labeling tasks. Long context was found to hinder performance, but removing instructions can mitigate this issue, indicating that strong sequence labeling performance can be achieved without explicit instructions. The study highlights the strengths and limitations of sequence labeling with large language models, emphasizing the importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised) generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL) from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL performance.

Summary: 
MedCOD is a hybrid framework that integrates domain-specific structured knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance English-to-Spanish medical translation. The framework combines structured prompting and fine-tuning techniques, using a parallel corpus of 2,999 English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles. Four open-source LLMs were evaluated, with MedCOD significantly improving translation quality across all models. Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved impressive results, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o. Ablation studies confirmed the individual contributions of MedCOD prompting and model adaptation to performance gains, with their combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings underscore the potential of structured knowledge integration in enhancing LLMs for medical translation tasks.

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999 English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23, chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical translation tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence, this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms. Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure, through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable intelligent systems.

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: The demand for text classification is growing significantly in web searching, data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents. Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of classification accuracy.

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words. It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

<title>We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty, and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate. Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33 participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers) forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech to health misinformation.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models' ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models, including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction (e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

<title>Privacy-Preserving Reasoning with Knowledge-Distilled Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud, risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content. However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA, leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG, resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore, achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally, guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

arXiv:2509.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding 70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities. Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms, left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

<title>Zero-shot Cross-lingual NER via Mitigating Language Difference: An Entity-aligned Translation Perspective</title>

arXiv:2509.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language (LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT) approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the entity alignment from source to target languages.

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning. Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture, and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable, controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored: interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing computational efficiency and performance. Optimizing acceleration after the fine-tuning phase and during inference is crucial for building an efficient architecture. This paper introduces Zero-Shot Adjustable Acceleration, a novel training and inference method that dynamically adjusts hardware usage during inference without requiring additional fine-tuning. The proposed approach is applied to newly developed models and evaluated across multiple classification and text generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method enables a wide range of acceleration in a zero-shot manner and achieves up to a 11x speedup compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA (Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7 percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3 seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality tradeoffs.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem. Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension, and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge. However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods, and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible. Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&amp;A, financial Q&amp;A, general Q&amp;A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

<title>Rethinking the Chain-of-Thought: The Roles of In-Context Learning and Pre-trained Priors</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional situations based on evaluative criteria.

<title>Culture is Everywhere: A Call for Intentionally Cultural Evaluation</title>

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings. In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks. We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered, programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1) replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination. Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of 19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset, respectively.

<title>Can Smaller LLMs do better? Unlocking Cross-Domain Potential through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Text Summarization</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile. However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally, the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with \texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific, Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger \texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b) Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is open-sourced to foster community research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval (ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation (LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question, answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably, compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1 and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

<title>Reasoning Vectors: Transferring Chain-of-Thought Capabilities via Task Arithmetic</title>

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by recycling prior computational investments.

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91. Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of more effective generative speech models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution, aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps, and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

<title>On the Alignment of Large Language Models with Global Human Opinion</title>

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs' opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore, changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global, language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/nlply/global-opinion-alignment.

<title>Trusted Uncertainty in Large Language Models: A Unified Framework for Confidence Calibration and Risk-Controlled Refusal</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage. Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction, semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and remains valid under distribution shift.

<title>Robust Knowledge Editing via Explicit Reasoning Chains for Distractor-Resilient Multi-Hop QA</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination, selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study, we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know? Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM systems.

<title>MeVe: A Modular System for Memory Verification and Effective Context Control in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval, context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information, MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support [16].

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe Union (B\&amp;S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement, and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the B\&amp;S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives. Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of community unionism across time and sector.

<title>CAT: Causal Attention Tuning For Injecting Fine-grained Causal Knowledge into Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at https://github.com/Kairong-Han/CAT.

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover, graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap, showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource. We will release the dataset and code publicly.

<title>Enhancing Uncertainty Estimation in LLMs with Expectation of Aggregated Internal Belief</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of self-evaluation score range.

<title>Testing the assumptions about the geometry of sentence embedding spaces: the cosine measure need not apply</title>

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings, as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks. Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding space.

<title>Benchmarking the Detection of LLMs-Generated Modern Chinese Poetry</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of AI-generated poetry.

<title>TransGAT: Transformer-Based Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Dimensional Automated Essay Scoring</title>

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES) offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring, overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion. To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring. TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score. Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT to advance AES systems.

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

<title>Bridging Thoughts and Words: Graph-Based Intent-Semantic Joint Learning for Fake News Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01660</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01660</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words, stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection, which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>chDzDT: Word-level morphology-aware language model for Algerian social media text</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01772</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01772</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations. However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

<title>Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e., repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition, answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics. This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs, thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing patient care outcomes.

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over previous methods without any human annotation.

arXiv:2509.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation, insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i) identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

arXiv:2509.02033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score (+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying argument structure similarities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs' reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis, endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

Abstract: We present the findings of the sixth Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification (NADI 2025) Shared Task, which focused on Arabic speech dialect processing across three subtasks: spoken dialect identification (Subtask 1), speech recognition (Subtask 2), and diacritic restoration for spoken dialects (Subtask 3). A total of 44 teams registered, and during the testing phase, 100 valid submissions were received from eight unique teams. The distribution was as follows: 34 submissions for Subtask 1 "five teams{\ae}, 47 submissions for Subtask 2 "six teams", and 19 submissions for Subtask 3 "two teams". The best-performing systems achieved 79.8% accuracy on Subtask 1, 35.68/12.20 WER/CER (overall average) on Subtask 2, and 55/13 WER/CER on Subtask 3. These results highlight the ongoing challenges of Arabic dialect speech processing, particularly in dialect identification, recognition, and diacritic restoration. We also summarize the methods adopted by participating teams and briefly outline directions for future editions of NADI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian, while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence, with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm. JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to 17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

<title>Meta-Pretraining for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition in Low-Resource Philippine Languages</title>

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed. Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of surface anchors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons, demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains. While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain. We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our experiments show that the fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

<title>Towards Fundamental Language Models: Does Linguistic Competence Scale with Model Size?</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster, suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core language ability. These results support a modular approach to language modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3) an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO (20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at: https://github.com/digailab/awesome-llm-implicit-reasoning.

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question answering, and timeline summarisation.

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely. Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms, creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models (CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth data.

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users' social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning, EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is available at https://github.com/slz0925/EmoPerso.

<title>Do LLMs Adhere to Label Definitions? Examining Their Receptivity to External Label Definitions</title>

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements, generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up to 20 percent across providers.

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models. Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data. Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$ can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative baselines.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000 news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP.

<title>The Forgotten Code: Validating a Century-Old Translation System with AI</title>

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci, who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history of the field is understood.

<title>Top-H Decoding: Adapting the Creativity and Coherence with Bounded Entropy in Text Generation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem, which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English (Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure, transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models, particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized models for code-mixed NER tasks.

<title>Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor $\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32 and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages. Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters), training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size, enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

<title>Jointly Reinforcing Diversity and Quality in Language Model Generations</title>

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity. At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning, encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as higher-quality responses.

<title>PalmX 2025: The First Shared Task on Benchmarking LLMs on Arabic and Islamic Culture</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently, LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures. This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15% on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be domain-dependent.

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech. We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1 score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed spoken dialog systems, yet the optimal architecture for real-time on-device voice agents remains an open question. While end-to-end approaches promise theoretical advantages, cascaded systems (CSs) continue to outperform them in language understanding tasks, despite being constrained by sequential processing latency. In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c) text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling. Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path forward for practical voice-based AI agents.

<title>Data Cartography for Detecting Memorization Hotspots and Guiding Data Interventions in Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal cost to generative performance.

<title>Learning to Refine: Self-Refinement of Parallel Reasoning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across 150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13), with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment evaluation.

Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed) established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We release all code, data, and models as open-source: https://obadx.github.io/prepare-quran-dataset/

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance. However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, Graphic User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex mobile tasks due to limited app-specific knowledge. While UI Transition Graphs (UTGs) offer structured navigation representations, they are underutilized due to poor extraction and inefficient integration. We introduce KG-RAG, a Knowledge Graph-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that transforms fragmented UTGs into structured vector databases for efficient real-time retrieval. By leveraging an intent-guided LLM search method, KG-RAG generates actionable navigation paths, enhancing agent decision-making. Experiments across diverse mobile apps show that KG-RAG outperforms existing methods, achieving a 75.8% success rate (8.9% improvement over AutoDroid), 84.6% decision accuracy (8.1% improvement), and reducing average task steps from 4.5 to 4.1. Additionally, we present KG-Android-Bench and KG-Harmony-Bench, two benchmarks tailored to the Chinese mobile ecosystem for future research. Finally, KG-RAG transfers to web/desktop (+40% SR on Weibo-web; +20% on QQ Music-desktop), and a UTG cost ablation shows accuracy saturates at ~4h per complex app, enabling practical deployment trade-offs.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling, KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned collective AI.

<title>ERank: Fusing Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning for Effective and Efficient Text Reranking</title>

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations, rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR, TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18% higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with {\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and effective credit interventions.

<title>On Verifiable Legal Reasoning: A Multi-Agent Framework with Formalized Knowledge Representations</title>

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes. The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps: analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points, significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches. Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to 18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and effective AI systems for legal domain.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval. Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.

<title>Aligning Reasoning LLMs for Materials Discovery with Physics-aware Rejection Sampling</title>

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1 diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and scalable alternative to Transformers.

<title>Self-Exploring Language Models for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Graphs via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

<title>Hybrid Topic-Semantic Labeling and Graph Embeddings for Unsupervised Legal Document Clustering</title>

Abstract: Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical legal applications.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient systems.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are difficult to capture with existing dimensionality reduction methods. To address this gap, we introduce a visualization technique that combines force-based projection and streaming clustering methods to build a spatial-temporal map of embeddings. Applying this technique, we create Chronotome, a tool for interactively exploring evolving themes in time-based data -- in real time. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through use cases on text and image data, showing how it offers a new lens for understanding the aesthetics and semantics of temporal datasets.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames. In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video MLLMs.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

<title>GradeSQL: Outcome Reward Models for Ranking SQL Queries from Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users. Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities. However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a 1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance. Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors. Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse semantic understanding scenarios.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech. Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription, reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and intonations.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns, ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods.
  While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of parameters, ArabEmoNet achieves superior results with just 1 million parameters, 90 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments. ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional performance and accessibility for real-world applications.

Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching (CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8% reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems. While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO, designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench, BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the instruct models by 9.03% and 9.44% on CV-Bench. Finally, we bring to the community new insights on RL-based visual tool-usage through extensive ablations. Our code is available at https://github.com/ls-kelvin/REVPT.

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches, and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use (psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex, strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information, \textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source \textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at https://github.com/Lemutisme/Sortage_Management, providing a novel computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex, information-scarce supply chains.

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Bili-Sakura/RSCC.

<title>Oyster-I: Beyond Refusal -- Constructive Safety Alignment for Responsible Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.

<title>How Real Is AI Tutoring? Comparing Simulated and Human Dialogues in One-on-One Instruction</title>

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning. However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an "explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational dialogue systems.

<title>EigenBench: A Comparative Behavioral Measure of Value Alignment</title>

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical, linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r = 0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged 288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and 59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary, topics, and genre-specific duration effects.

<title>From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach</title>

Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems.

Abstract: A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions - forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications. Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities.
  We release the dataset with a CC-BY-4.0 license and make the evaluation code available at: https://github.com/nilshoehing/rocketscience

Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler, single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4 patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid. To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for 16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2) correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work, we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes, and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237, WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

<title>FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training</title>

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches, native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet, a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper, we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural" monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

<title>Similarity between Units of Natural Language: The Transition from Coarse to Fine Estimation</title>

Abstract: Capturing the similarities between human language units is crucial for explaining how humans associate different objects, and therefore its computation has received extensive attention, research, and applications. With the ever-increasing amount of information around us, calculating similarity becomes increasingly complex, especially in many cases, such as legal or medical affairs, measuring similarity requires extra care and precision, as small acts within a language unit can have significant real-world effects. My research goal in this thesis is to develop regression models that account for similarities between language units in a more refined way.
  Computation of similarity has come a long way, but approaches to debugging the measures are often based on continually fitting human judgment values. To this end, my goal is to develop an algorithm that precisely catches loopholes in a similarity calculation. Furthermore, most methods have vague definitions of the similarities they compute and are often difficult to interpret. The proposed framework addresses both shortcomings. It constantly improves the model through catching different loopholes. In addition, every refinement of the model provides a reasonable explanation. The regression model introduced in this thesis is called progressively refined similarity computation, which combines attack testing with adversarial training. The similarity regression model of this thesis achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling edge cases.

Abstract: Recent studies on knowledge graph embedding focus on mapping entities and relations into low-dimensional vector spaces. While most existing models primarily exploit structural information, knowledge graphs also contain rich contextual and textual information that can enhance embedding effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel model that integrates both contextual and textual signals into entity and relation embeddings through a graph convolutional network. To better utilize context, we introduce two metrics: confidence, computed via a rule-based method, and relatedness, derived from textual representations. These metrics enable more precise weighting of contextual information during embedding learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing consistent improvements over strong baselines.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for question answering over knowledge graphs based on graph-to-segment mapping, designed to improve the understanding of natural language questions. Our approach is grounded in semantic parsing, a key technique for interpreting question utterances. The main challenges arise from handling implicit entities and relations, as well as complex constraints such as temporal conditions, ordinality, and aggregation within the context of a knowledge graph. To address these issues, our framework integrates both rule-based and neural methods to parse and construct accurate, comprehensive semantic segment sequences. These sequences are then assembled into semantic query graphs, providing precise representations of question utterances. We formulate question semantic parsing as a sequence generation task, employing an encoder-decoder neural network to map natural language questions into semantic segments. Furthermore, to enhance the identification of implicit entities and relations, we incorporate a graph neural network that leverages knowledge graph context to enrich question representations. Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our model in semantic parsing for knowledge graph question answering.

<title>Into the crossfire: evaluating the use of a language model to crowdsource gun violence reports</title>

Abstract: Gun violence is a pressing human rights issue that affects nearly every dimension of the social fabric, from healthcare and education to psychology and the economy. Reliable data on firearm events is paramount to developing more effective public policy and emergency responses. However, the lack of comprehensive databases and the risks of in-person surveys prevent human rights organizations from collecting needed data in most countries. Here, we partner with a Brazilian human rights organization to conduct a systematic evaluation of language models to assist with monitoring real-world firearm events from social media data. We propose a fine-tuned BERT-based model trained on Twitter (now X) texts to distinguish gun violence reports from ordinary Portuguese texts. We then incorporate our model into a web application and test it in a live intervention. We study and interview Brazilian analysts who continuously check social media texts to identify new gun violence events. Qualitative assessments show that our solution helped all analysts use their time more efficiently and expanded their search capacities. Quantitative assessments show that the use of our model was associated with analysts having further interactions with online users reporting gun violence. Our findings suggest that human-centered interventions using language models can help support the work of human rights organizations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating text that is similar to or surpasses human quality. However, it is unclear whether LLMs tend to exhibit distinctive linguistic styles akin to how human authors do. Through a comprehensive linguistic analysis, we compare the vocabulary, Part-Of-Speech (POS) distribution, dependency distribution, and sentiment of texts generated by three of the most popular LLMS today (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard) to diverse inputs. The results point to significant linguistic variations which, in turn, enable us to attribute a given text to its LLM origin with a favorable 88\% accuracy using a simple off-the-shelf classification model. Theoretical and practical implications of this intriguing finding are discussed.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) remains one of the last NLP tasks where large language models (LLMs) have not yet replaced dedicated supervised systems. This work exploits the complementary strengths of LLMs and supervised MT by guiding LLMs to automatically post-edit MT with external feedback on its quality, derived from Multidimensional Quality Metric (MQM) annotations. Working with LLaMA-2 models, we consider prompting strategies varying the nature of feedback provided and then fine-tune the LLM to improve its ability to exploit the provided guidance. Through experiments on Chinese-English, English-German, and English-Russian MQM data, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to post-edit MT improves TER, BLEU and COMET scores, although the benefits of fine-grained feedback are not clear. Fine-tuning helps integrate fine-grained feedback more effectively and further improves translation quality based on both automatic and human evaluation.

<title>Why Not Transform Chat Large Language Models to Non-English?</title>

Abstract: The scarcity of non-English data limits the development of non-English large language models (LLMs). Transforming English-centric LLMs to non-English has been identified as an effective and resource-efficient method. Previous works start from base LLMs and perform knowledge distillation (KD) with data generated by stronger LLMs, e.g. GPT-4. Compared to base LLMs, chat LLMs are further optimized for advanced abilities, e.g. multi-turn conversation and human preference alignment, and thus more powerful in both helpfulness and safety. However, transforming a chat LLM involves two critical issues: (1) How can we effectively transfer advanced abilities without their supervised data? (2) How can we prevent the original knowledge from catastrophic forgetting during transformation? We target these issues by introducing a simple framework called TransLLM. For the first issue, TransLLM divides the transfer problem into some common sub-tasks with the translation chain-of-thought, which uses the translation as the bridge between English and non-English step-by-step. We further enhance the performance of sub-tasks with publicly available data. For the second issue, we propose a method comprising two synergistic components: low-rank adaptation for training to maintain the original LLM parameters, and recovery KD, which utilizes data generated by the chat LLM itself to recover the original knowledge from the frozen parameters. In the experiments, we transform the LLaMA-2-chat-7B to the Thai language. Our method, using only single-turn data, outperforms strong baselines and ChatGPT on multi-turn benchmark MT-bench. Furthermore, our method, without safety data, rejects more harmful queries of safety benchmark AdvBench than both ChatGPT and GPT-4. Code is available at https://github.com/hy5468/TransLLM.

<title>Intrinsic Test of Unlearning Using Parametric Knowledge Traces</title>

Abstract: The task of "unlearning" certain concepts in large language models (LLMs) has attracted immense attention recently, due to its importance in mitigating undesirable model behaviours, such as the generation of harmful, private, or incorrect information. Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely rely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned knowledge within the model's parameters. This residual knowledge can be adversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We argue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this end, we propose a general evaluation methodology that leverages vocabulary projections to inspect concepts encoded in model parameters. We use this approach to localize "concept vectors" - parameter vectors that encode concrete concepts - and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning methods minimally impact concept vectors and mostly suppress them during inference, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the associated knowledge and significantly reduces the model's susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Our results highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parameter-based evaluations. To support this, we release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/yihuaihong/ConceptVectors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable versatility and adaptability, while their widespread adoption across various applications also raises critical safety concerns. This paper focuses on the impact of backdoored LLMs. Traditional backdoor injection methods are primarily limited to yes-or-no discriminative tasks, leading users to underestimate the potential risks of backdoored LLMs. Given the inherently generative nature of LLMs, this paper reveals that a generative backdoor injected into LLMs can expose the true safety risks in their applications. We propose an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to expand the backdoor to generative tasks in a unified format of any text-to any text, leading to natural generations with a specific intention. Experiments show that MEGen achieves a high attack success rate by adjusting only a small set of local parameters with few-shot samples. Notably, we show that the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while completing downstream tasks. Our work highlights that MEGen enables backdoors in LLMs to exhibit generative capabilities, causing potential safety risks by altering the generative style. The code is available at https://github.com/MonoQ-hub/MEGen.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but often falter on complex problems that require structured, multi-step reasoning. We introduce the Diagram of Thought (DoT), a new framework that enables a single LLM to build and navigate a mental map of its reasoning. Instead of thinking in a straight line, the model constructs a dynamic diagram of ideas, where it can propose different lines of thought, critique its own steps, and synthesize validated insights into a final conclusion. This entire process is self-contained within the model, making it highly efficient by avoiding the complex external controllers or search algorithms required by other methods. To ensure the reliability of this process, we ground DoT in a rigorous mathematical framework from category theory. This foundation guarantees that the way the model combines information is logical, consistent, and robust, regardless of the order in which ideas were explored. The result is a more powerful and transparent reasoning process that produces a fully auditable, step-by-step trace of the LLM's thinking, bridging the gap between fluent language and formal reasoning.

<title>Mitigating Semantic Leakage in Cross-lingual Embeddings via Orthogonality Constraint</title>

Abstract: Accurately aligning contextual representations in cross-lingual sentence embeddings is key for effective parallel data mining. A common strategy for achieving this alignment involves disentangling semantics and language in sentence embeddings derived from multilingual pre-trained models. However, we discover that current disentangled representation learning methods suffer from semantic leakage - a term we introduce to describe when a substantial amount of language-specific information is unintentionally leaked into semantic representations. This hinders the effective disentanglement of semantic and language representations, making it difficult to retrieve embeddings that distinctively represent the meaning of the sentence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training objective, ORthogonAlity Constraint LEarning (ORACLE), tailored to enforce orthogonality between semantic and language embeddings. ORACLE builds upon two components: intra-class clustering and inter-class separation. Through experiments on cross-lingual retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks, we demonstrate that training with the ORACLE objective effectively reduces semantic leakage and enhances semantic alignment within the embedding space.

<title>Learning by Surprise: Surplexity for Mitigating Model Collapse in Generative AI</title>

Abstract: As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed "autophagy". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a model trains on data that does not "surprise" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy: filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results provide a richer understanding of model collapse and point toward more resilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments increasingly saturated with synthetic data.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful method for enhancing natural language generation by integrating external knowledge into a model's output. While prior work has demonstrated the importance of improving knowledge retrieval for boosting generation quality, the role of knowledge selection, a.k.a. reranking or filtering, remains less clear. This paper empirically analyzes how knowledge selection influences downstream generation performance in RAG systems. By simulating different retrieval and selection conditions through a controlled mixture of gold and distractor knowledge, we assess the impact of these factors on generation outcomes. Our findings indicate that the downstream generator model's capability, as well as the complexity of the task and dataset, significantly influence the impact of knowledge selection on the overall RAG system performance. In typical scenarios, improving the knowledge recall score is key to enhancing generation outcomes, with the knowledge selector providing limited benefit when a strong generator model is used on clear, well-defined tasks. For weaker generator models or more ambiguous tasks and datasets, the knowledge F1 score becomes a critical factor, and the knowledge selector plays a more prominent role in improving overall performance.

Abstract: Solving complex chart Q&amp;A tasks requires advanced visual reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including recognizing key information from visual inputs and conducting reasoning over it. While fine-tuning MLLMs for reasoning is critical, collecting and annotating charts and questions is expensive, hard to scale, and often results in low-quality annotations. To address this, we propose Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT), a cost-effective, efficient and scalable data synthesis method for distilling visual reasoning abilities from LLMs to MLLMs. The code serves as an intermediary that translates visual chart representations into textual representations, enabling language models to understand cross-modal information and generate reasoning chains accordingly. In this way, we can employ text-based synthesizing techniques to expand chart-plotting code and generate high-quality Q&amp;A pairs for training models. This produces ReachQA, a dataset containing 3k reasoning-intensive charts and 20k Q&amp;A pairs to enhance both recognition and reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Experiments show that models fine-tuned with ReachQA not only perform well on chart-related tasks but also show performance gains on general reasoning benchmarks. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/hewei2001/ReachQA.

Abstract: Qualitative analysis is critical to understanding human datasets in many social science disciplines. A central method in this process is inductive coding, where researchers identify and interpret codes directly from the datasets themselves. Yet, this exploratory approach poses challenges for meeting methodological expectations (such as ``depth'' and ``variation''), especially as researchers increasingly adopt Generative AI (GAI) for support. Ground-truth-based metrics are insufficient because they contradict the exploratory nature of inductive coding, while manual evaluation can be labor-intensive. This paper presents a theory-informed computational method for measuring inductive coding results from humans and GAI. Our method first merges individual codebooks using an LLM-enriched algorithm. It measures each coder's contribution against the merged result using four novel metrics: Coverage, Overlap, Novelty, and Divergence. Through two experiments on a human-coded online conversation dataset, we 1) reveal the merging algorithm's impact on metrics; 2) validate the metrics' stability and robustness across multiple runs and different LLMs; and 3) showcase the metrics' ability to diagnose coding issues, such as excessive or irrelevant (hallucinated) codes. Our work provides a reliable pathway for ensuring methodological rigor in human-AI qualitative analysis.

Abstract: Given the increasing use of synthetic data in language model (LM) post-training, an LM's ability to generate high-quality data has become nearly as crucial as its ability to solve problems directly. While prior works have focused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic comparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address this gap, we propose AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized settings and metrics to evaluate LMs' data generation abilities. Through synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, we uncover key insights about LMs' data generation capabilities. First, we observe that LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For instance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability. Instead, multiple intrinsic features of data quality-including response quality, perplexity, and instruction difficulty-collectively serve as better indicators. Finally, we demonstrate that strategic choices in output format and cost-conscious model selection significantly impact data generation effectiveness.

Abstract: Low-resource languages serve as invaluable repositories of human history, embodying cultural evolution and intellectual diversity. Despite their significance, these languages face critical challenges, including data scarcity and technological limitations, which hinder their comprehensive study and preservation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative opportunities for addressing these challenges, enabling innovative methodologies in linguistic, historical, and cultural research. This study systematically evaluates the applications of LLMs in low-resource language research, encompassing linguistic variation, historical documentation, cultural expressions, and literary analysis. By analyzing technical frameworks, current methodologies, and ethical considerations, this paper identifies key challenges such as data accessibility, model adaptability, and cultural sensitivity. Given the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness inherent in low-resource languages, this work emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of customized models as promising avenues for advancing research in this domain. By underscoring the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with the humanities to preserve and study humanity's linguistic and cultural heritage, this study fosters global efforts towards safeguarding intellectual diversity.

Abstract: LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.

Abstract: Text sanitization aims to rewrite parts of a document to prevent disclosure of personal information. The central challenge of text sanitization is to strike a balance between privacy protection (avoiding the leakage of personal information) and utility preservation (retaining as much as possible of the document's original content). To this end, we introduce a novel text sanitization method based on generalizations, that is, broader but still informative terms that subsume the semantic content of the original text spans. The approach relies on the use of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and is divided into two stages. Given a document including text spans expressing personally identifiable information (PII), the LLM is first applied to obtain truth-preserving replacement candidates for each text span and rank those according to their abstraction level. Those candidates are then evaluated for their ability to protect privacy by conducting inference attacks with the LLM. Finally, the system selects the most informative replacement candidate shown to be resistant to those attacks. This two-stage process produces replacements that effectively balance privacy and utility.
  We also present novel metrics to evaluate these two aspects without needing to manually annotate documents. Results on the Text Anonymization Benchmark show that the proposed approach, implemented with Mistral 7B Instruct, leads to enhanced utility, with only a marginal (< 1 p.p.) increase in re-identification risk compared to fully suppressing the original spans. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be more truth-preserving than existing methods such as Microsoft Presidio's synthetic replacements.

Abstract: As recursion has been underlying any linguistic work for the last 60 years, the acquisition of recursive structures by children during language learning has become a focal point of inquiry. This study delves into the developmental trajectory of Mandarin-speaking children's acquisition of recursive possessives and locatives, assessing the impact of structural diversity on language acquisition. The research contrasts the comprehension of two-level recursive structures among children aged 3 to 7 years, employing answering question while seeing a picture task to elicit responses. The findings indicate that children do not attain adult-like proficiency in two-level recursion until the age of 6, and there exists a notable asymmetry in the acquisition of recursive possessives versus locatives. These results underscore the primacy of structural complexity and cognitive factors in the acquisition process, enhancing our comprehension of the cognitive foundations of language development and the pivotal role of recursion in child language acquisition.

<title>Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Cross-Linguistic Transfer from Typologically Similar High-Resource Languages</title>

Abstract: This study examines the cross-linguistic effectiveness of transfer learning for low-resource machine translation by fine-tuning models initially trained on typologically similar high-resource languages, using limited data from the target low-resource language. We hypothesize that linguistic similarity enables efficient adaptation, reducing the need for extensive training data. To test this, we conduct experiments on five typologically diverse language pairs spanning distinct families: Semitic (Modern Standard Arabic to Levantine Arabic), Bantu (Hausa to Zulu), Romance (Spanish to Catalan), Slavic (Slovak to Macedonian), and a language isolate (Eastern Armenian to Western Armenian). Results show that transfer learning consistently improves translation quality across all pairs, confirming its applicability beyond closely related languages. As a secondary analysis, we vary key hyperparameters learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and weight decay to ensure results are not dependent on a single configuration. We find that moderate batch sizes (e.g., 32) are often optimal for similar pairs, smaller sizes benefit less similar pairs, and excessively high learning rates can destabilize training. These findings provide empirical evidence for the generalizability of transfer learning across language families and offer practical guidance for building machine translation systems in low-resource settings with minimal tuning effort.

Abstract: With rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing application of LLMs in creative content ideation and generation. A critical question emerges: can current LLMs provide ideas that are diverse enough to truly bolster collective creativity? We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, an automatic metric that measures the uniqueness of a plot element among alternative storylines generated using the same prompt under an LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations and across different LLMs, while plots from the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens. However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources. In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces. We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems. To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens. Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various tasks such as natural language understanding, text summarization, and machine translation. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their effectiveness in domain-specific applications that require specialized knowledge, such as healthcare, chemistry, or legal analysis. To address this, researchers have explored diverse methods to enhance LLMs by integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of these methods, which we categorize into four key approaches: dynamic knowledge injection, static knowledge embedding, modular adapters, and prompt optimization. Each approach offers unique mechanisms to equip LLMs with domain expertise, balancing trade-offs between flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. We discuss how these methods enable LLMs to tackle specialized tasks, compare their advantages and disadvantages, evaluate domain-specific LLMs against general LLMs, and highlight the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field. For those interested in delving deeper into this area, we also summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an open-source at: https://github.com/abilliyb/Knowledge_Injection_Survey_Papers, dedicated to documenting research in the field of specialized LLM.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) employ various forms of logical inference, both implicitly and explicitly, when addressing reasoning tasks. Understanding how to optimally leverage these inference paradigms is critical for advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper adopts an exploratory approach by introducing a controlled evaluation environment for analogical reasoning -- a fundamental cognitive task -- that is systematically parameterized across three dimensions: modality (textual, visual, symbolic), difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and task format (multiple-choice or free-text generation). We analyze the comparative dynamics of inductive, abductive, and deductive inference pipelines across these dimensions, and demonstrate that our findings generalize to broader in-context learning tasks. Additionally, we investigate advanced paradigms such as hypothesis selection, verification, and refinement, revealing their potential to scale up logical inference in LLM reasoning. This exploratory study provides a foundation for future research in enhancing LLM reasoning through systematic logical inference strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically undergo instruction tuning to enhance alignment. Recent studies emphasize that quality and diversity of instruction data are more crucial than quantity, highlighting the need to select diverse, high-quality subsets to reduce training costs. However, how to evolve these selected subsets alongside the development of new instruction data remains insufficiently explored. To achieve LLMs' ongoing alignment, we introduce Instruction Bank (\textbf{InsBank}), a continuously updated repository that integrates the latest valuable instruction data. We further propose Progressive Instruction Bank Evolution (\textbf{PIBE}), a novel framework designed to evolve InsBank effectively and efficiently over time. PIBE employs a gradual data selection strategy to maintain long-term efficiency, leveraging a representation-based diversity score to capture relationships between data points and retain historical information for comprehensive diversity evaluation. This also allows for flexible combination of diversity and quality scores during data selection and ranking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIBE significantly outperforms baselines in InsBank evolution and is able to extract budget-specific subsets, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.

Abstract: Instruction tuning in low-resource languages remains underexplored due to limited text data, particularly in government and cultural domains. To address this, we introduce and open-source a large-scale (10,600 samples) instruction-following (IFT) dataset, covering key institutional and cultural knowledge relevant to Kazakhstan. Our dataset enhances LLMs' understanding of procedural, legal, and structural governance topics. We employ LLM-assisted data generation, comparing open-weight and closed-weight models for dataset construction, and select GPT-4o as the backbone. Each entity of our dataset undergoes full manual verification to ensure high quality. We also show that fine-tuning Qwen, Falcon, and Gemma on our dataset leads to consistent performance improvements in both multiple-choice and generative tasks, demonstrating the potential of LLM-assisted instruction tuning for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.

Abstract: Can we improve machine translation (MT) with LLMs by rewriting their inputs automatically? Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is easier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text in many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily exploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of 21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English into 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective MT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using quality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms that simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT. These results suggest LLM-assisted input rewriting as a promising direction for improving translations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general-purpose reasoning by leveraging broad commonsense knowledge, but they remain limited in tasks requiring personalized reasoning over multifactorial personal data. This limitation constrains their applicability in domains such as healthcare, where decisions must adapt to individual contexts. We introduce Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning, a framework that enables LLMs to reason over individual-specific causal graphs constructed from longitudinal data. Each graph encodes how user-specific factors influence targeted outcomes. In response to a query, the LLM traverses the graph to identify relevant causal pathways, rank them by estimated impact, simulate potential outcomes, and generate tailored responses. We implement this framework in the context of nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, where variability in metabolic responses demands personalized reasoning. Using counterfactual evaluation, we assess the effectiveness of LLM-generated food suggestions for glucose control. Our method reduces postprandial glucose iAUC across three time windows compared to prior approaches. Additional LLM-as-a-judge evaluations further confirm improvements in personalization quality.

Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operation, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously, which decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility and generalization of \texttt{TabAF}. Under the same model size, \texttt{TabAF} achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.

Abstract: This paper presents UniBERT, a compact multilingual language model that uses an innovative training framework that integrates three components: masked language modeling, adversarial training, and knowledge distillation. Pre-trained on a meticulously curated Wikipedia corpus spanning 107 languages, UniBERT is designed to reduce the computational demands of large-scale models while maintaining competitive performance across various natural language processing tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four tasks - named entity recognition, natural language inference, question answering, and semantic textual similarity - demonstrate that our multilingual training strategy enhanced by an adversarial objective significantly improves cross-lingual generalization. Specifically, UniBERT models show an average relative improvement of 7.72% over traditional baselines, which achieved an average relative improvement of only 1.17%, and statistical analysis confirms the significance of these gains (p-value = 0.0181). This work highlights the benefits of combining adversarial training and knowledge distillation to build scalable and robust language models, thus advancing the field of multilingual and cross-lingual natural language processing.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations, which manipulate chart representations to support specific claims, can distort perception and lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite decades of research, they remain a widespread issue-posing risks to public understanding and raising safety concerns for AI systems involved in data-driven communication. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong chart comprehension abilities, their capacity to detect and interpret misleading charts remains unexplored. We introduce Misleading ChartQA benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to evaluate MLLMs on misleading chart reasoning. It contains 3,026 curated examples spanning 21 misleader types and 10 chart types, each with standardized chart code, CSV data, multiple-choice questions, and labeled explanations, validated through iterative MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs, analyze their performance across misleader types and chart formats, and propose a novel region-aware reasoning pipeline that enhances model accuracy. Our work lays the foundation for developing MLLMs that are robust, trustworthy, and aligned with the demands of responsible visual communication.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior listwise ranking performance. However, their superior performance often relies on large-scale parameters (\eg, GPT-4) and a repetitive sliding window process, which introduces significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoRanking}, a novel collaborative ranking framework that combines small and large ranking models for efficient and effective ranking. CoRanking first employs a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing relevant ones to the top part of the list (\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise reranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the whole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more efficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have significant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the top-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal performance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a passage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the top passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of passage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that CoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about 70\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM listwise reranker.

Abstract: Preference learning is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet its success hinges on high-quality datasets comprising three core components: Preference \textbf{A}nnotations, \textbf{I}nstructions, and \textbf{R}esponse Pairs. Current approaches conflate these components, obscuring their individual impacts and hindering systematic optimization. In this work, we propose \textbf{AIR}, a component-wise analysis framework that systematically isolates and optimizes each component while evaluating their synergistic effects. Through rigorous experimentation, AIR reveals actionable principles: annotation simplicity (point-wise generative scoring), instruction inference stability (variance-based filtering across LLMs), and response pair quality (moderate margins + high absolute scores). When combined, these principles yield +5.3 average gains over baseline method, even with only 14k high-quality pairs. Our work shifts preference dataset design from ad hoc scaling to component-aware optimization, offering a blueprint for efficient, reproducible alignment.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become more capable and accurate across many tasks, some fundamental sources of unreliability remain in their behavior. One key limitation is their inconsistency at reporting the same information when prompts are changed. In this paper, we consider the discrepancy between a model's generated answer and their own verification of that answer, the generator-validator gap. We define this gap in a more stringent way than prior work: we expect correlation of scores from a generator and a validator over the entire set of candidate answers, i.e., candidate completions that could possibly arise during ordinary language use without breaking Gricean norms. We show that according to this measure, a large gap exists in various settings, including question answering, lexical semantics tasks, and next-word prediction. We then propose RankAlign, a ranking-based training method, and show that it significantly closes the gap, surpassing all baseline methods. Moreover, this approach generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks and lexical items.

Abstract: How can a monolingual English speaker determine whether an automatic translation in French is good enough to be shared? Existing MT error detection and quality estimation (QE) techniques do not address this practical scenario. We introduce AskQE, a question generation and answering framework designed to detect critical MT errors and provide actionable feedback, helping users decide whether to accept or reject MT outputs even without the knowledge of the target language. Using ContraTICO, a dataset of contrastive synthetic MT errors in the COVID-19 domain, we explore design choices for AskQE and develop an optimized version relying on LLaMA-3 70B and entailed facts to guide question generation. We evaluate the resulting system on the BioMQM dataset of naturally occurring MT errors, where AskQE has higher Kendall's Tau correlation and decision accuracy with human ratings compared to other QE metrics.

<title>Deep Binding of Language Model Virtual Personas: a Study on Approximating Political Partisan Misperceptions</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of simulating human behavior, offering cost-effective ways to estimate user responses to various surveys and polls. However, the questions in these surveys usually reflect socially understood attitudes: the patterns of attitudes of old/young, liberal/conservative, as understood by both members and non-members of those groups. It is not clear whether the LLM binding is \emph{deep}, meaning the LLM answers as a member of a particular in-group would, or \emph{shallow}, meaning the LLM responds as an out-group member believes an in-group member would. To explore this difference, we use questions that expose known in-group/out-group biases. This level of fidelity is critical for applying LLMs to various political science studies, including timely topics on polarization dynamics, inter-group conflict, and democratic backsliding. To this end, we propose a novel methodology for constructing virtual personas with synthetic user "backstories" generated as extended, multi-turn interview transcripts. This approach is justified by the theory of \emph{narrative identity} which argues that personality at the highest level is \emph{constructed} from self-narratives. Our generated backstories are longer, rich in detail, and consistent in authentically describing a singular individual, compared to previous methods. We show that virtual personas conditioned on our backstories closely replicate human response distributions (up to an 87% improvement as measured by Wasserstein Distance) and produce effect sizes that closely match those observed in the original studies of in-group/out-group biases. Altogether, our work extends the applicability of LLMs beyond estimating socially understood responses, enabling their use in a broader range of human studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire general linguistic knowledge from massive-scale pretraining. However, pretraining data mainly comprised of web-crawled texts contain undesirable social biases which can be perpetuated or even amplified by LLMs. In this study, we propose an efficient yet effective annotation pipeline to investigate social biases in the pretraining corpora. Our pipeline consists of protected attribute detection to identify diverse demographics, followed by regard classification to analyze the language polarity towards each attribute. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the effect of our bias analysis and mitigation measures, focusing on Common Crawl as the most representative pretraining corpus.

Abstract: The Latin script is often used to informally write languages with non-Latin native scripts. In many cases (e.g., most languages in India), the lack of conventional spelling in the Latin script results in high spelling variability. Such romanization renders languages that are normally easily distinguished due to being written in different scripts - Hindi and Urdu, for example - highly confusable. In this work, we increase language identification (LID) accuracy for romanized text by improving the methods used to synthesize training sets. We find that training on synthetic samples which incorporate natural spelling variation yields higher LID system accuracy than including available naturally occurring examples in the training set, or even training higher capacity models. We demonstrate new state-of-the-art LID performance on romanized text from 20 Indic languages in the Bhasha-Abhijnaanam evaluation set (Madhani et al., 2023a), improving test F1 from the reported 74.7% (using a pretrained neural model) to 85.4% using a linear classifier trained solely on synthetic data and 88.2% when also training on available harvested text.

Abstract: Reward design plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, serving as the bridge between feedback signals and model optimization. This survey provides a structured organization of reward modeling and addresses three key aspects: mathematical formulation, construction practices, and interaction with optimization paradigms. Building on this, it develops a macro-level taxonomy that characterizes reward mechanisms along complementary dimensions, thereby offering both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for alignment research. The progression of LLM alignment can be understood as a continuous refinement of reward design strategies, with recent developments highlighting paradigm shifts from reinforcement learning (RL)-based to RL-free optimization and from single-task to multi-objective and complex settings.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

Abstract: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps. Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.

Abstract: The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex, and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content, thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this field.

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

<title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>

Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without exposing raw data, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the factual accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at the intersection of RAG and federated systems.

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES). This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language model used for spell correction and an encoder-based token-classifier trained to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using (1) error highlights and (2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps users compare MT inputs and outputs through (3) backtranslation and (4) question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes, adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on cooperativity. This leaves a gap in the systematic understanding of strategic communication in adversarial settings. To address this, we introduce SDA (Strategic Discourse Assessment), a framework grounded in Gricean and game-theoretic pragmatics to assess strategic use of language. It adapts the ME Game jury function to make it empirically estimable for analyzing dialogue. Our approach incorporates two key adaptations: a commitment-based taxonomy of discourse moves, which provides a finer-grained account of strategic effects, and the use of estimable proxies grounded in Gricean maxims to operationalize abstract constructs such as credibility. Together, these adaptations build on discourse theory by treating discourse as the strategic management of commitments, enabling systematic evaluation of how conversational moves advance or undermine discourse goals. We further derive three interpretable metrics-Benefit at Turn (BAT), Penalty at Turn (PAT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBAT)-to quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present CPD (the Crooked Path Dataset), an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts, introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models express biased points of view or produce different results based on the assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores. However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer, this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the description of their persona since the model already knows their socio-demographics.

Abstract: Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research, disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature, and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms. Each symptom cell contains a binary value, indicating whether a symptom is associated with a disease. Thereby, this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across many natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, their quadratic computational and memory requirements, particularly in self-attention layers, pose challenges for efficient inference on long contexts and for deployment in resource-limited environments. We present TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformers into Titans), a framework designed to augment pretrained Transformers with linearized attention (LiZA) and internal memory gating via Memory as Gate (MaG), applied without full retraining. TPTT supports parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and integrates with standard toolkits such as Hugging Face Transformers. We evaluated TPTT on several pretrained models, including Llama-1B, OlMoE-1B-7B, Qwen2.5-1.5B, Gemma3-270m, OpenELM-1.3B, and Mistral-7B, in order to assess applicability across architectures of different scales.Experiments on models with approximately 1 billion parameters, evaluated primarily on the MMLU benchmark, suggest potential improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline models. For example, Titans-Llama-1B exhibited up to a 20\% relative increase in Exact Match scores in one-shot evaluation. An additional finding is that it is possible to convert a quadratic-attention model into a purely linear-attention model using the DeltaProduct mechanism. All training runs were carried out with modest computational resources.These preliminary findings indicate that TPTT may help adapt pretrained LLMs for long-context tasks with limited overhead. Further studies on larger models and a broader set of benchmarks will be necessary to evaluate the generality and robustness of the framework.

<title>Flow-Modulated Scoring for Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion demands effective modeling of multifaceted semantic relationships between entities. Yet, prevailing methods, which rely on static scoring functions over learned embeddings, struggling to simultaneously capture rich semantic context and the dynamic nature of relations. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework, conceptualizing a relation as a dynamic evolutionary process governed by its static semantic environment. FMS operates in two stages: it first learns context-aware entity embeddings via a Semantic Context Learning module, and then models a dynamic flow between them using a Conditional Flow-Matching module. This learned flow dynamically modulates a base static score for the entity pair. By unifying context-rich static representations with a conditioned dynamic flow, FMS achieves a more comprehensive understanding of relational semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FMS establishes a new state of the art across both canonical knowledge graph completion tasks: relation prediction and entity prediction. On the standard relation prediction benchmark FB15k-237, FMS achieves a near-perfect MRR of 99.8\% and Hits@1 of 99.7\% using a mere 0.35M parameters, while also attaining a 99.9\% MRR on WN18RR. Its dominance extends to entity prediction, where it secures a 25.2\% relative MRR gain in the transductive setting and substantially outperforms all baselines in challenging inductive settings. By unifying a dynamic flow mechanism with rich static contexts, FMS offers a highly effective and parameter-efficient new paradigm for knowledge graph completion.

<title>MedVAL: Toward Expert-Level Medical Text Validation with Language Models</title>

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench), and 3) MedVAL-4B (https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Abstract: Current long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models excel at mathematical reasoning but rely on slow and error-prone natural language traces. Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill, that distills complementary reasoning strategies from multiple teachers into a unified student model. Using this approach, we train Agentic-R1, which dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including both computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy distillation in achieving robust and efficient reasoning.

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail, merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs) that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second, retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

<title>How Important is `Perfect' English for Machine Translation Prompts?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently, with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2), legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors, limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared BERT-base-NER.

<title>Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need</title>

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

<title>From Disagreement to Understanding: The Case for Ambiguity Detection in NLI</title>

Abstract: This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language Inference (NLI) is not mere noise but often reflects meaningful variation, especially when triggered by ambiguity in the premise or hypothesis. While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior contribute to variation, content-based ambiguity provides a process-independent signal of divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI that first identifies ambiguous input pairs, classifies their types, and only then proceeds to inference. To support this shift, we present a framework that incorporates ambiguity detection and classification prior to inference. We also introduce a unified taxonomy that synthesizes existing taxonomies, illustrates key subtypes with examples, and motivates targeted detection methods that better align models with human interpretation. Although current resources lack datasets explicitly annotated for ambiguity and subtypes, this gap presents an opportunity: by developing new annotated resources and exploring unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection, we enable more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.

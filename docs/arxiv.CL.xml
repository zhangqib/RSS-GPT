<div> logic puzzles, large language models, phantom recall, reasoning, perturbations<br>
Summary:<br>
The article discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in solving logic puzzles, highlighting that their apparent reasoning ability may actually be based on memorized templates. When faced with slightly modified puzzles, LLMs exhibit a significant drop in performance, indicating a reliance on memorization rather than genuine reasoning. The research introduces the PHANTOM RECALL benchmark, comprising logic puzzles and perturbations designed to test reasoning structure comprehension. It identifies a recurring failure mode termed phantom recall, where LLMs provide incorrect solutions or rationales based on retained memory that no longer align with the altered scenario. To address this issue, the study introduces tools such as an automated logical-equivalence judge, a fine-grained reasoning error taxonomy, and a prompting-based mitigation framework. Despite high accuracy on unmodified puzzles, LLMs consistently underperform humans on perturbed puzzles, showcasing a gap between linguistic fluency and true logical understanding. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues? To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25 well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

<div> keywords: Large Language Models, world modeling, future state prediction, reward estimation, Retrieval-augmented World Model

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance agent decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and predicting action outcomes. However, their tendency toward hallucination and reliance on static training knowledge can lead to errors in long-horizon simulations. The study systematically investigates LLMs' capabilities in world modeling through tasks such as next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. While LLMs perform well in capturing immediate next states and identifying state transitions, their performance deteriorates in full-procedure planning, indicating limitations in modeling environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM) is proposed, which incorporates up-to-date knowledge retrieved from external sources. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in longer-horizon simulations with R-WoM compared to baselines. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs' tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge, which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

<div> knowledge representations, Large Language Models (LLMs), truthfulness, robustness, generalizability
<br>
The study investigates the fragility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in terms of their internal knowledge representations. By testing the separability of true and false statements under various out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, the research shows that LLMs struggle to maintain robust knowledge when faced with superficially different inputs. Results suggest that while LLMs can distinguish between true and false statements that closely resemble their training data, this ability diminishes as statements become more OOD. The findings highlight a potential explanation for the brittleness of LLM performance on benchmarks, indicating that these models may learn shallow and non-robust knowledge representations. The study emphasizes the importance of improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations for enhancing the reliability and generalizability of LLMs.
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

<div> Keywords: Large reasoning models, machine translation, intermediate tokens, fine-tuning, translation-specific prompting strategies 

Summary: 
Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown success in various problem-solving tasks but their impact on machine translation (MT) is not well understood. This study explores the use of intermediate tokens in MT across different language pairs and setups. The results show that the generation of "thinking tokens" does not significantly improve LRMs in MT tasks. Fine-tuning models with synthetic chain of thought (CoT) explanations for translation steps does not outperform standard fine-tuning. However, combining outputs of translation-specific prompting strategies for intermediate tokens leads to better performance. The findings suggest that using a teacher for target translation refinement or expanding parallel corpora is more effective than distilling CoT explanations into MT models. <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that "thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically, fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However, constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT explanations into "thinking" MT models.

Summary:
MIND is a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline designed to detect factual and cultural discrepancies in multilingual question answering knowledge bases. It aims to ensure consistency in objective queries across languages while considering cultural variations in subjective responses. By highlighting divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions, MIND helps improve the accuracy and cultural awareness of QA systems. The system was evaluated on a bilingual QA system in maternal and infant health and a dataset of bilingual questions annotated for inconsistencies was released. MIND demonstrated its reliability in identifying inconsistencies across different domains, supporting the development of culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?, while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

<div> keywords: Large Language Models, autoformalisation, formal proof assistants, TopoAlign, code repositories
Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are proficient in both informal and formal mathematical reasoning but struggle with autoformalisation, the task of translating informal mathematics into a formal format. To address this challenge, the TopoAlign framework leverages code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs by structurally aligning code data with formal statements. This approach significantly improves the performance of DeepSeek-Math by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10, showcasing the benefits of training on aligned code data. Additionally, the framework also enhances the performance of Herald by 0.12% and 1.09% on BEq@10 and typecheck@10, respectively. The results demonstrate that utilizing code repositories for training Math LLMs can be advantageous even for specialized models, without requiring additional human annotation. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4) mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements. Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10 and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code data is beneficial even for specialized models.

Summary:
The article introduces GRAVITY, a framework for generating synthetic preference data that captures users' interests, values, beliefs, and personality traits to improve personalization in large language models (LLMs). By integrating various frameworks and psychological models, GRAVITY creates profile-grounded synthetic data to guide personalized content generation. Evaluation on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users shows that GRAVITY outperforms other methods, particularly across different cultures. The results indicate that profile-grounded synthetic data can effectively capture user variation, reduce reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered content, offering a scalable approach for LLM personalization. User studies demonstrate that outputs from GRAVITY are preferred over 86% of the time, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests, values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural, and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions, Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits -- GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation. We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation, especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over 4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

<div> Keywords: RAG systems, multi-hop reasoning, unanswerable queries, benchmark, CRUMQs

Summary:<br><br>
The article introduces a pipeline for creating challenging and realistic unanswerable multi-hop queries for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing benchmarks for RAG systems often lack complexity and can be easily cheated through disconnected reasoning or simple factual recall. To address this limitation, the authors present a pipeline for generating uncheatable, realistic, unanswerable, and multi-hop queries (CRUMQs) that can be tailored to different domains and corpora. By applying the pipeline to two popular RAG datasets, the authors show that CRUMQs significantly increase the challenge for RAG systems, reducing cheatability scores by up to 81%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the pipeline in enhancing benchmark difficulty and realism, providing a valuable tool for driving the development of more capable RAG systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this, existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable, and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs), adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive development of more capable RAG systems.

Summary:<br>
Decoder-only transformers in large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well, with early layers focusing on input context, middle layers on task-specific processing, and late layers on output token generation. Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD) hypothesis suggests that after processing by early and middle layers, hidden states may contain enough information for generating multiple tokens using only late layers, without repeated traversal. DMTD Qwen3-4B model, even trained on a limited dataset, has shown promising results with up to a 2x speedup and minor performance loss. It is expected to perform even better with larger datasets, as per scaling analysis. This method requires no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification. <br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification. Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

<div> framework, agents, context management, reinforcement learning, task decomposition
Summary:
Context-Folding is introduced as a framework for large language model (LLM) agents to actively manage their working context by branching into sub-trajectories to handle subtasks. The FoldGRPO framework utilizes reinforcement learning with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. This approach allows the agent to collapse intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. On complex long-horizon tasks such as Deep Research and SWE, the folding agent matches or outperforms ReAct baselines using a smaller active context. It significantly outperforms models relying on summarization-based context management. Overall, the Context-Folding framework enhances the performance of LLM agents by allowing them to manage their context efficiently, leading to improved task performance on long-horizon tasks. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$ smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based context management.

<div> autoformalisation, conjecturing, Large Language Models, ConjectureBench, Lean-FIRe<br><br>Summary: Autoformalisation is traditionally viewed as translating informal mathematical statements into formal language, yet an important preliminary step, conjecturing, is often overlooked. This process involves forming a hypothesis or a conjecture, which is crucial before any formalization can occur. Existing evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1 generally overestimate their effectiveness in autoformalisation because they disregard this aspect. To address this, the newly created ConjectureBench dataset and a specialized evaluation framework have been introduced to measure the conjecturing capacity of LLMs separately from the autoformalisation process. The study’s findings indicate that while LLMs can generate accurate conjectures, treating conjecturing as a distinct and critical task significantly enhances the overall performance of autoformalisation. The novel method, Lean-FIRe, further improves conjecturing and autoformalisation and has successfully formalized several problems from the PutnamBench with notable efficacy using LLMs. The research advocates for a shift in focus towards improving conjecturing capabilities in formal mathematical reasoning, highlighting it as an essential yet underexplored facet. <div>
arXiv:2510.11986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This, however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1 and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation. Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

<div> Simulation framework, multi-turn interactive agents, user behavior, business context, agent evaluation

Summary:
SAGE is a new user simulation framework designed to evaluate multi-turn interactive agents. It incorporates top-down knowledge from business contexts, such as ideal customer profiles, to create realistic customer personas for user simulation. Additionally, SAGE integrates bottom-up knowledge from business agent infrastructure to generate interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a specific market. Empirical evaluation shows that SAGE produces more realistic and diverse interactions compared to existing approaches. It also identifies up to 33% more agent errors, making it an effective tool for bug-finding and agent improvement through iterative processes. SAGE bridges the gap between generic user simulation models and domain-specific principles, offering a more comprehensive evaluation approach for multi-turn interactive agents in various business contexts. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior. We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles, grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

<div> Automatic Question Generation, Plagiarism, Discrete Mathematics, Academic Dishonesty, Linear-time Algorithm

Summary:
Automated Question Generation (AQG) is proposed as a solution to combat plagiarism in higher education by creating unique and diverse questions for students, specifically focusing on Discrete Mathematics. Existing AQGs have inefficiencies in question generation, prompting the development of a new approach that defines questions using a formal language and employs a linear-time algorithm. Experiments conducted to evaluate the system demonstrated that the accuracy of questions generated by the AQG is comparable to textbook questions. The difficulty level of generated questions was also found to be similar to textbook questions, validating the quality of the AQG in providing relevant and challenging practice questions to students. <div>

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally, AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language, translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions, textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

<div> Keywords: information extraction, neuro-symbolic system, large language model, agricultural domain, real-world applications

Summary: 
The paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) information extraction system with a large language model (LLM) based system in the agricultural domain. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS system in terms of overall performance, speed of deployment, and ease of maintenance. The NS approach offers advantages such as faster runtime and greater control but lacks generalizability and struggles with contextual nuances. On the other hand, the LLM-based system has higher performance but comes with drawbacks like slower runtime, model dependency, and hallucination risks. The study emphasizes the importance of balancing performance, efficiency, and control when deploying NLP systems in real-world applications. The findings highlight the trade-offs between the two approaches and the hidden costs associated with developing and maintaining such systems. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS) and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details. However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime, greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime, limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and control.

<div> Keywords: large language models, Curative Prompt Refinement, hallucination, prompt refinement, fine-tuned language model <br>
Summary: <br>
The article introduces Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a framework designed to improve the quality of responses generated by large language models by refining poorly structured or vague prompts. CPR cleans ill-formed prompts and provides additional task descriptions to clarify user intentions. By fine-tuning a small language model, CPR aligns user intentions with the prompts to reduce the risk of generating incorrect facts or hallucinations. Empirical studies demonstrate that prompts refined with CPR achieve a significant improvement in generation quality and a reduction in hallucinations. The application of CPR results in over a 90\% win rate compared to original prompts without external knowledge. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation, typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\% win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Summary: <br>
This paper explores how human label variation (HLV) impacts model fairness, a relatively uninvestigated area. The study compares training models on majority-vote labels with various HLV methods and finds that without explicit debiasing, these HLV training methods enhance fairness.

By examining the interplay between HLV and model training, the study sheds light on the positive impact of HLV methods on fairness, providing insights into the importance of addressing biases in the training data. These findings suggest that incorporating HLV techniques in model training can contribute to promoting fairness and mitigating biases in machine learning systems. <div>

The role of UQ in hallucination detection is crucial for identifying unreliable outputs that may contain factual inaccuracies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for hallucination detection.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generation, prompt rewriting, large language models, image-text alignment, visual quality

Summary:
Large language models are leveraged to refine user inputs for text-to-image (T2I) generation, improving image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics. A reward system and iterative training pipeline enhance prompts without supervised fine-tuning data. The prompt rewriter outperforms baselines across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Transferability is demonstrated as the rewriter trained on one backbone generalizes effectively to others. Scalability is studied, showing performance gains scaling with the capacity of the large LLM. Prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and model-agnostic strategy for enhancing T2I systems. Code and trained prompt rewriters will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality. We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained prompt rewriters soon.

<div> Hierarchical Alignment, Direct Preference Optimization, Large Language Models, Transformer Architecture, Surgical Fine-Tuning

Summary:
Hierarchical Alignment introduces a targeted alignment method for Large Language Models, focusing on distinct functional blocks of model layers: local, intermediate, and global. Experimental results on models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA show significant improvements. Local-Align enhances grammatical fluency, while Global-Align is the most effective for logical coherence, outperforming baselines. The hierarchical strategies avoid the "alignment tax" seen in standard DPO. This approach offers a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable way to align models, highlighting the potential of structure-aware surgical fine-tuning for advanced LLM development.

<br><br>Summary: 
1. Hierarchical Alignment targets specific functional blocks of model layers: local, intermediate, and global.
2. Experimental results demonstrate significant and predictable improvements in model performance.
3. Local-Align enhances grammatical fluency, while Global-Align is most effective for logical coherence.
4. The hierarchical strategies avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO.
5. This approach offers a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, showing potential for advanced LLM development. <div>
arXiv:2510.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture, where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate (logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge, demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly, aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO, where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more advanced and reliable LLMs.

<div> memory footprint, quadratic self-attention, ContextRot, long-context summarization tasks, APCE <br>
Summary:<br>
The paper addresses challenges in deploying Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs), focusing on memory efficiency and mitigating ContextRot effects. By selecting important input chunks using APCE, a context-aware solution, the proposed method reduces memory footprint and improves summarization performance. APCE operates independently of specific hardware or CUDA environments, making it adaptable for different deployment systems. Empirical evaluations show that APCE achieves comparable or superior summarization results to the full dense baseline, while using only a fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence. This approach enhances KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency in LCTMs, offering a promising solution for long-context tasks that require efficient processing. The research suggests future exploration of context-aware efficiency solutions to optimize LCTM performance across various applications. <br> <div>
arXiv:2510.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length. Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards other relevant long-context tasks.

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets: the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939, sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive (0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain, though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho = 0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore, linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a greater diversity of associative patterns.

<div> Keywords: Multilingual domain adaptation, large language models, knowledge acquisition, cross-lingual transfer, bilingual corpus

Summary:
Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is crucial for transferring domain knowledge across languages to large language models (LLMs). Existing methods for ML-DA often fall short due to a lack of understanding of how domain knowledge is learned within a language and transferred across languages. In this study, the authors introduce AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that directly studies multilingual knowledge acquisition by building multiple-choice QA datasets from a bilingual domain corpus. By continually training LLMs with diverse data recipes, the study tracks how LLMs acquire domain facts and identifies the mechanism behind the transformation process from domain training data to knowledge. Experimenting with a 13B English-Japanese bilingual LLM, the results show that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging, even with a high-quality bilingual corpus. The code for this study has been made publicly available for further research and development. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Summary: <br>
The study investigates the modality gap in Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) where performance differs between speech and text inputs. Coarse-grained analysis shows alignment in direction but divergence in magnitude between speech and text representations. This similarity is correlated with the modality gap. Fine-grained analysis reveals a token-level alignment pattern and introduces the Alignment Path Score to quantify alignment quality. Strategies like angle projection and length normalization on critical tokens show potential to improve correctness in speech inputs.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.

<div> Safety, Multi-turn dialogues, Benchmarks, Safety Index, Dialogue safety moderator

Summary:
SafeMT introduces a new benchmark, focusing on safety issues in multi-turn dialogues involving harmful queries and images. The benchmark includes 10,000 samples with varying scenarios and jailbreak methods. A Safety Index (SI) is proposed to assess the safety of Multiple Language Large Models (MLLMs) during conversations. Evaluation of 17 models using the benchmark reveals an increased risk of successful attacks with more turns in harmful dialogues, indicating inadequate safety mechanisms in current models. A dialogue safety moderator is proposed to detect malicious intent in conversations and provide relevant safety policies to MLLMs. Experimental results show the moderator's effectiveness in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existing guard models. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts; however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index (SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed guard models.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Hallucination, Credal Transformer, Uncertainty Quantification, AI reliability<br>
Summary:<br>
Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate factually incorrect assertions due to the Softmax function in Transformers creating "Artificial Certainty." The introduction of the Credal Transformer with Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based on evidential theory aims to mitigate this issue. CAM produces a "credal set" of distributions instead of a single attention vector, measuring model uncertainty. By re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution, the Credal Transformer can identify out-of-distribution inputs, quantify ambiguity, and reduce confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. This new architecture integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, enhancing AI reliability and providing a foundation for more trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.<br>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer, which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions) instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution, representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a foundation for more reliable AI.

Summary:
This paper explores the adaptation of established techniques for text-based reasoning to continuous space reasoning using the COCONUT model. By generating diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling, the potential for performance improvement is revealed. However, challenges arise in discriminating between correct and incorrect reasoning in the continuous space. Marginal improvements are seen when applying discrete space training techniques to the continuous space, indicating a need for inductive biases in continuous thought representations. The study delves into geometric properties and trajectory dynamics to identify the reasons behind ineffective discrimination. The authors suggest that training frameworks for continuous reasoning LMs should not only focus on accuracy but also on incorporating inductive biases for improved performance during inference. Overall, the research highlights the necessity of integrating inductive biases for effective continuous space reasoning. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning (essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data will be publicly available.}

<div> Keywords: drug repurposing, biomedical knowledge graphs, large language models, knowledge graph embedding, Alzheimer's disease

Summary:
Drug repurposing is crucial for accelerating treatment discovery, particularly for complex and rare diseases. The proposed LLaDR framework enhances the representation of biomedical concepts within knowledge graphs by leveraging large language models to extract semantically enriched treatment-related textual representations. By fine-tuning knowledge graph embedding models with these representations, LLaDR injects treatment-relevant knowledge, leading to improved semantic understanding of under-studied or complex indications. Experimental results demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in various scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease confirming its effectiveness. The code for LLaDR is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery, especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models (LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

Summary:<br><br>Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly used for audio understanding and multimodal reasoning but struggle with accurately predicting event timings. This study systematically examined temporal bias in LALMs and found that they often predict event timestamps that are inaccurate in relation to ground truth. The temporal bias was found to be common across datasets and models, increasing with audio length and varying depending on event types and positions. The Temporal Bias Index (TBI) was introduced to measure the misalignment in predicted event timings, highlighting the need for more temporally robust architectures in LALMs. These findings underscore a significant limitation in current LALMs and suggest the importance of further research and development in this area.<br><br> <div>

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

<div> Keywords: simultaneous speech translation, segmentation models, Direct Preference Optimization, language models, real-time interpretation

Summary:
In this study, the researchers propose a segmentation framework for simultaneous speech translation that utilizes large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The aim is to improve segmentation accuracy, translation quality, and latency in real-time interpretation. By incorporating human preference alignment, the method enables LLMs to predict natural segmentation points more effectively. The experiments conducted on the ACL 60/60 corpus across three language pairs show that the DPO-tuned LLM outperforms existing models like SHAS in terms of segmentation accuracy, translation quality (measured by BLEU and COMET scores), and latency (Average Lagging). Comparisons with IWSLT baselines further demonstrate the system's effectiveness. These results highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs in advancing adaptive, human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2 as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive, human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Summary:<br>
Large language models (LLMs) are being used in critical domains, necessitating thorough fairness and bias evaluation before deployment. The HALF framework introduced in this study considers harm severity and real-world scenarios, categorizing application domains into three tiers based on severity. Evaluation results of eight LLMs show inconsistencies in fairness across domains, indicating that model size or performance does not guarantee fairness. Reasoning models perform differently in medical decision support and education applications. The study highlights a gap between benchmarking success and deployment readiness, emphasizing the importance of addressing bias in LLMs for ethical deployment. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical. However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, biases, intentionality judgements, Layer-Patching analysis, targeted interventions

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, including the Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgments. Through a Layer-Patching analysis on 3 LLMs, researchers identified that this bias is learned during finetuning and localized in specific layers of the model. Surprisingly, patching activations from the pretrained model into critical layers effectively eliminated the bias, indicating targeted interventions can mitigate social biases in LLMs without requiring model retraining. This study provides insights into how biases manifest in LLMs and offers a promising approach for interpreting, localizing, and addressing biases in these models. Targeted interventions at specific layers can play a crucial role in addressing biases in LLMs, highlighting the potential for improving model fairness and reducing biased outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining.

<div> propose, Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening, multi-document question answering, long-range dependency modeling, lost-in-the-middle issue <br>
Summary:<br>
The article introduces Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) as a solution to the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in multi-document question answering tasks. DSAS consists of two modules, Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) and Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS), which address the challenges of long-range dependency modeling and the "lost-in-the-middle" issue. The CGW module assesses paragraph relevance and position-aware weighting, while the RAS module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing irrelevant information exchange. DSAS does not require architectural modifications or additional training parameters, making it a plug-and-play solution. Experimental results on mainstream LLMs show an average F1-score improvement of 4.2% in multi-doc QA tasks. Ablation studies confirm the significance of both modules, and detailed discussions in the Appendix validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS. <div>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the ''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS) module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

Summary:<br>
The study introduces MedQA-Followup, a framework for assessing multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. It distinguishes between shallow and deep robustness and introduces an indirect-direct axis. Evaluating five LLMs on the MedQA dataset, the study finds that models perform well under shallow perturbations but exhibit vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings. Accuracy drops significantly under challenges across turns, with indirect interventions proving more harmful than direct suggestions. Model differences are also observed, with some showing performance drops under repeated interventions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct). Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment. Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable deployment of medical LLMs.

<div> encoder-only Transformers, Chinese ModernBERT, pre-training pipeline, long-sequence throughput, open contrastive data<br>
<br>
Summary: <br>
Chinese ModernBERT is a new encoder designed specifically for the Chinese language. It incorporates a hardware-aware vocabulary, whole-word masking, extended pre-training pipeline, and a damped-cosine learning-rate schedule. The model is competitive with other Chinese encoders on the CLUE dataset and achieves high throughput for long sequences while maintaining speed for short sequences. By fine-tuning on open contrastive data, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses other models on the SimCLUE test set. The addition of T2Ranking data further enhances the model's performance. Tokenizer and weights will be released to facilitate reproducible research. <div>

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture, data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware 32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii) a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to 8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed, reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data: fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking (~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set. Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible research.

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches, our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention, opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces a novel framework for generating counter-speech targeting specific groups, such as women, people of color, and migrants, to combat harmful content effectively. By integrating advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and a knowledge base sourced from various reputable sources, the framework ensures the generation of reliable and coherent counter-speech. Empirical assessments using the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset demonstrate that the framework outperforms standard Large Language Model baselines and competitive approaches in generating high-quality counter-speech for different target groups. The study opens up possibilities for producing trustworthy and effective counter-speech in addressing hate speech and similar issues. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse language processing tasks.

Summary:
MoBiLE is a new offloading-based framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, introducing a mixture of big-little experts to enhance efficiency. The framework reduces the number of experts for unimportant tokens while maintaining full experts for important tokens, ensuring model quality. A dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is implemented to switch between little and big experts for improved memory efficiency. Evaluation on modern MoE architectures and generative tasks demonstrate a speedup of 1.60x to 1.72x compared to the baseline on consumer GPU systems, with minimal impact on accuracy. The proposed approach addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a promising solution for optimizing MoE inference performance with fine-grained expert segmentation. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck, existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference. These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality. Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to 1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible degradation in accuracy.

<div> bias, fairness, LLMs, peer review, research <br>
<br>
Summary: 
The study explores the impact of integrating large language models (LLMs) as both reviewers and authors in the academic workflow. Through simulations and human annotations, the research finds that LLM reviewers exhibit biases such as inflating scores for LLM-authored papers and underrating human-authored papers with critical statements. These biases are attributed to preferences for LLM-generated writing styles and an aversion to critical feedback. The findings underscore the risks and equity concerns of using LLMs in the peer review process without proper caution. However, revisions guided by LLM reviews lead to quality improvements in evaluations for both LLM-based and human-authored papers, suggesting potential benefits for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality submissions. <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow, potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review, their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent, which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand, revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

Summary: 
- A study evaluated tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to identify disparities in large language models.
- Standardized preprocessing and tokenization processes were applied using the tiktoken library.
- Latin-script languages demonstrated higher tokenization efficiency compared to non-Latin and morphologically complex languages.
- Non-Latin languages often experienced significantly higher token inflation, leading to increased computational costs.

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations. This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces PRoH, a dynamic Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework, addressing limitations in existing KH-based RAG methods. PRoH incorporates a context-aware planning module for structurally grounded reasoning plan generation, a structured question decomposition process for adaptive exploration, and an EWO-guided reasoning path retrieval algorithm for coherent hyperedge traversals. Experiments show PRoH outperforms HyperGraphRAG, achieving a 19.73% increase in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation score. PRoH demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multi-hop question answering tasks, highlighting its robustness in long-range reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2510.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning, non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation; (ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive, multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation (G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Summary:
CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG) addresses the unfaithfulness issue in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems by analyzing hidden-state representations in Large Language Models. Findings from the probing-based analysis show that knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts are identified at the sentence level, and irrelevant context may be amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. The CLEAR framework decomposes context into fine-grained knowledge, localizes conflicting information using hidden-state probing, and introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide accurate integration of retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR significantly improves both accuracy and contextual faithfulness, outperforming strong baselines in various conflict conditions. The resources for CLEAR are available on GitHub at https://github.com/LinfengGao/CLEAR.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory, particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge, and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under diverse conflict conditions.

Summary: 
- The study examined the linguistic abilities of Large Language Models in a morphological generalization task across four languages.
- The models demonstrated human-like accuracy in generalizing morphological processes to unseen words.
- Model accuracy was found to be influenced more by the size of speaker communities and data availability rather than structural complexity.
- Languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital representation, such as Spanish and English, exhibited higher accuracy.
- The findings suggest that model behavior is driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather than sensitivity to grammatical complexity, indicating a superficial resemblance to human linguistic competence.

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words. Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However, accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Summary:
Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC) is a novel training framework designed to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional embeddings generated by large language models (LLMs). It introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning (SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on various datasets show that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For example, on the BEIR dataset, SMEC outperforms other models in compressing LLM2Vec embeddings to 256 dimensions, showing improvements of 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have advanced in generating personalized text, posing risks of identity impersonation. A benchmark dataset called \dataset is introduced to evaluate detector robustness in personalized settings, highlighting performance disparities among detectors. The feature-inversion trap, where discriminative features become misleading in personalized text, is identified as a key limitation. A method called \method is proposed to predict detector performance changes accurately in personalized settings by identifying latent feature directions and constructing probe datasets. This method shows an 85% correlation with actual performance gaps post-transfer. The study aims to spur further research in detecting personalized text to address the growing concern of identity impersonation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation, producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further research on personalized text detection.

Summary: 
Test-time scaling, a technique to enhance LLM outputs through additional computation, is typically applied in domains with correct answers like mathematics and coding. This study aims to transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025 tasks for evaluating annotation disagreements. Three test-time scaling methods were tested: Model Averaging, Majority Voting, and Best-of-N sampling. While the benchmark methods improved LLM performance on the tasks, the Best-of-N method did not show improvement. This suggests that the Best-of-N method may not directly transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks. The study provides insights into the challenges of applying test-time scaling techniques across different domains. <div>

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge, test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers, like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025 tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for this gap.

<div> prior, Vision Language Models, evaluation dataset, conceptual understanding, incongruent images

Summary:
The article discusses the tension between pragmatic and semantic priors in Vision Language Models (VLMs) when analyzing individual instances. VLMs learn generalized knowledge during training but are typically used for specific cases, leading to a conflict between the relevance of textual and visual inputs and the general truth of conceptual representations. The authors introduce a new evaluation dataset, VISaGE, comprising typical and exceptional images to study this trade-off. Experiments show that VLMs' conceptual understanding deteriorates when faced with incongruent images that challenge the pragmatic prior of input congruency. This degradation is more pronounced than the impact of the semantic prior when querying individual instances. The findings shed light on how VLMs balance conflicting priors and highlight the importance of congruent inputs for maintaining conceptual understanding.

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category. In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images. In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

<title>Teaching Language Models to Faithfully Express their Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge, creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or 'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering (QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

<title>StyleDecipher: Robust and Explainable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts with Stylistic Analysis</title>

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings, StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts, demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for distinguishing machine-generated text.

Abstract: We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation, that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5 million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12 directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models (LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively, while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to 24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation domain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic domain and long-context translation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent, high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the 'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models, particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs. Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most 8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks, although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

<title>Reasoning Pattern Matters: Learning to Reason without Human Rationales</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories (rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed, procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights, we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations. Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning patterns.

<title>Generation Space Size: Understanding and Calibrating Open-Endedness of LLM Generations</title>

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals, providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations. We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective, we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable, efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such detailed captions.

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell, 2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences. Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate, Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii) generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive. Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic "competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating, and interpreting language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning. Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Abstract: Creating speech datasets for low-resource languages is a critical yet poorly understood challenge, particularly regarding the actual cost in human labor. This paper investigates the time and complexity required to produce high-quality annotated speech data for a subset of low-resource languages, low literacy Predominately Oral Languages, focusing on Bambara, a Manding language of Mali. Through a one-month field study involving ten transcribers with native proficiency, we analyze the correction of ASR-generated transcriptions of 53 hours of Bambara voice data. We report that it takes, on average, 30 hours of human labor to accurately transcribe one hour of speech data under laboratory conditions and 36 hours under field conditions. The study provides a baseline and practical insights for a large class of languages with comparable profiles undertaking the creation of NLP resources.

Abstract: This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are: proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation; empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large language models in social science experiments.

Abstract: Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of 0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction. These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.

Abstract: This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers. Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of online political discourse during times of war.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable LLM--data integration.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of our approach.

<title>Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?</title>

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation with significantly reduced training costs.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform complex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online information, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs with such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is especially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as biosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice: simply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can elicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the elevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet, jailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks, as they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap, we propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects malicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes harmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive experiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including general and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key findings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful prompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step planning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities that prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass refusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content, compared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental misalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to DR agents.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.

Abstract: Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal reasoning. This paper introduces U}nified Audio Language Model (UALM), which aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate, using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning. Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed by subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning, drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs reasoning with task demands.

<title>One Life to Learn: Inferring Symbolic World Models for Stochastic Environments from Unguided Exploration</title>

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only "one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure, activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex, hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO, our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured, object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments.

<title>Precise Attribute Intensity Control in Large Language Models via Targeted Representation Editing</title>

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods, however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks: preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1 and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g., instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Web applications are prime targets for cyberattacks as gateways to critical services and sensitive data. Traditional penetration testing is costly and expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet, their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.

Abstract: Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity. Audio samples are provided on https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DiSTAR_demo.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode. Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2 NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters (i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during inference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric level. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is more efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document interaction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric injection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic study of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that parameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents, and relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction at text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level document information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents within the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual documents, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and become more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either source alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents and advocate for increasing the information content of parametric representations to advance PRAG.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from $5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges. Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000 to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE), and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on $309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated $3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency, underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content anonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility. Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure anonymity in long-form audio.

<title>SRUM: Fine-Grained Self-Rewarding for Unified Multimodal Models</title>

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts. This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward} ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a \textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82 to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation via self-rewarding.

Abstract: Incorporating structured knowledge into pre-trained language models has demonstrated signiffcant bene-ffts for domain-speciffc natural language processing tasks, particularly in specialized ffelds like military intelligence analysis. Existing approaches typically integrate external knowledge through masking tech-niques or fusion mechanisms, but often fail to fully leverage the intrinsic tactical associations and factual information within input sequences, while introducing uncontrolled noise from unveriffed exter-nal sources. To address these limitations, we present MLRIP (Military Language Representation with Integrated Prior), a novel pre-training framework that introduces a hierarchical knowledge integration pipeline combined with a dual-phase entity substitu-tion mechanism. Our approach speciffcally models operational linkages between military entities, capturing critical dependencies such as command, support, and engagement structures. Comprehensive evaluations on military-speciffc NLP tasks show that MLRIP outperforms existing BERT-based models by substantial margins, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in military entity recognition, typing, and operational linkage extraction tasks while demonstrating superior operational efffciency in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a dataset for the computational study of a number of Modern Greek dialects. It consists of raw text data from four dialects of Modern Greek, Cretan, Pontic, Northern Greek and Cypriot Greek. The dataset is of considerable size, albeit imbalanced, and presents the first attempt to create large scale dialectal resources of this type for Modern Greek dialects. We then use the dataset to perform dialect idefntification. We experiment with traditional ML algorithms, as well as simple DL architectures. The results show very good performance on the task, potentially revealing that the dialects in question have distinct enough characteristics allowing even simple ML models to perform well on the task. Error analysis is performed for the top performing algorithms showing that in a number of cases the errors are due to insufficient dataset cleaning.

<title>When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.

Abstract: Few-shot named entity recognition can identify new types of named entities based on a few labeled examples. Previous methods employing token-level or span-level metric learning suffer from the computational burden and a large number of negative sample spans. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning (MsFNER), which splits the general NER into two stages: entity-span detection and entity classification. There are 3 processes for introducing MsFNER: training, finetuning, and inference. In the training process, we train and get the best entity-span detection model and the entity classification model separately on the source domain using meta-learning, where we create a contrastive learning module to enhance entity representations for entity classification. During finetuning, we finetune the both models on the support dataset of target domain. In the inference process, for the unlabeled data, we first detect the entity-spans, then the entity-spans are jointly determined by the entity classification model and the KNN. We conduct experiments on the open FewNERD dataset and the results demonstrate the advance of MsFNER.

<title>Cross-Modal Safety Alignment: Is textual unlearning all you need?</title>

Abstract: Recent studies reveal that integrating new modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), creates a new attack surface that bypasses existing safety training techniques like Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). While further SFT and RLHF-based safety training can be conducted in multi-modal settings, collecting multi-modal training datasets poses a significant challenge. Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where, regardless of the combination of input modalities, all inputs are ultimately fused into the language space, we aim to explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our evaluation across six datasets empirically demonstrates the transferability -- textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8\% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2\% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside preserving the utility. Moreover, our experiments show that unlearning with a multi-modal dataset offers no potential benefits but incurs significantly increased computational demands, possibly up to 6 times higher.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced natural language processing, driving significant breakthroughs in tasks such as text generation, machine translation, and domain-specific reasoning. The field now faces a critical dilemma in its approach: closed-source models like GPT-4 deliver state-of-the-art performance but restrict reproducibility, accessibility, and external oversight, while open-source frameworks like LLaMA and Mixtral democratize access, foster collaboration, and support diverse applications, achieving competitive results through techniques like instruction tuning and LoRA. Hybrid approaches address challenges like bias mitigation and resource accessibility by combining the scalability of closed-source systems with the transparency and inclusivity of open-source framework. However, in this position paper, we argue that open-source remains the most robust path for advancing LLM research and ethical deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces AFRIDOC-MT, a document-level multi-parallel translation dataset covering English and five African languages: Amharic, Hausa, Swahili, Yor\`ub\'a, and Zulu. The dataset comprises 334 health and 271 information technology news documents, all human-translated from English to these languages. We conduct document-level translation benchmark experiments by evaluating neural machine translation (NMT) models and large language models (LLMs) for translations between English and these languages, at both the sentence and pseudo-document levels. These outputs are realigned to form complete documents for evaluation. Our results indicate that NLLB-200 achieved the best average performance among the standard NMT models, while GPT-4o outperformed general-purpose LLMs. Fine-tuning selected models led to substantial performance gains, but models trained on sentences struggled to generalize effectively to longer documents. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that some LLMs exhibit issues such as under-generation, repetition of words or phrases, and off-target translations, especially for African languages.

<title>ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/NVIDIA/kvpress}{link}.

Abstract: Purpose: Emotion is a fundamental component of human communication, shaping understanding, trust, and engagement across domains such as education, healthcare, and mental health. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning and knowledge generation capabilities, they still struggle to express emotions in a consistent, controllable, and contextually appropriate manner. This limitation restricts their potential for authentic human-AI interaction. Methods: We propose a controllable emotion generation framework based on Emotion Vectors (EVs) - latent representations derived from internal activation shifts between neutral and emotion-conditioned responses. By injecting these vectors into the hidden states of pretrained LLMs during inference, our method enables fine-grained, continuous modulation of emotional tone without any additional training or architectural modification. We further provide theoretical analysis proving that EV steering enhances emotional expressivity while maintaining semantic fidelity and linguistic fluency. Results: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that the proposed approach achieves consistent emotional alignment, stable topic adherence, and controllable affect intensity. Compared with existing prompt-based and fine-tuning-based baselines, our method demonstrates superior flexibility and generalizability. Conclusion: Emotion Vector (EV) steering provides an efficient and interpretable means of bridging rational reasoning and affective understanding in large language models, offering a promising direction for building emotionally resonant AI systems capable of more natural human-machine interaction.

Abstract: While reasoning and multilingual capabilities in language models (LMs) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, their integration into a unified paradigm - multilingual reasoning - is at a nascent stage. Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks. Rapid growth of evolving developments in this field can be actively tracked on our project page: [https://github.com/AkashGhosh/Survey-of-Multilingual-Reasoning-in-Language-Models](https://github.com/AkashGhosh/Survey-of-Multilingual-Reasoning-in-Language-Models)

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning abilities, yet their reliance on structured step-by-step processing reveals a critical limitation. In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.

Abstract: Existing challenges in misinformation exposure and susceptibility vary across demographic groups, as some populations are more vulnerable to misinformation than others. Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior. This research explores the interplay between humans and LLMs, highlighting demographic differences in the context of misinformation and offering insights for future interventions.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents has created a new ecosystem of strategic, agent-to-agent interactions. However, a critical challenge remains unaddressed: in high-stakes, emotion-sensitive domains like debt collection, LLM agents pre-trained on human dialogue are vulnerable to exploitation by adversarial counterparts who simulate negative emotions to derail negotiations. To fill this gap, we first contribute a novel dataset of simulated debt recovery scenarios and a multi-agent simulation framework. Within this framework, we introduce EmoDebt, an LLM agent architected for robust performance. Its core innovation is a Bayesian-optimized emotional intelligence engine that reframes a model's ability to express emotion in negotiation as a sequential decision-making problem. Through online learning, this engine continuously tunes EmoDebt's emotional transition policies, discovering optimal counter-strategies against specific debtor tactics. Extensive experiments on our proposed benchmark demonstrate that EmoDebt achieves significant strategic robustness, substantially outperforming non-adaptive and emotion-agnostic baselines across key performance metrics, including success rate and operational efficiency. By introducing both a critical benchmark and a robustly adaptive agent, this work establishes a new foundation for deploying strategically robust LLM agents in adversarial, emotion-sensitive debt interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have led to a growing number of papers related to finance in top-tier Natural Language Processing (NLP) venues. To systematically examine this trend, we review 374 NLP research papers published between 2017 and 2024 across 38 conferences and workshops, with a focused analysis of 221 papers that directly address finance-related tasks. We evaluate these papers across 11 quantitative and qualitative dimensions, and our study identifies the following opportunities for NLP researchers: (i) expanding the scope of forecasting tasks; (ii) enriching evaluation with financial metrics; (iii) leveraging multilingual and crisis-period datasets; and (iv) balancing PLMs with efficient or interpretable alternatives. We identify actionable directions supported by dataset and tool recommendations, with implications for both the academia and industry communities.

Abstract: We introduce AgentAda, the first LLM-powered analytics agent that can learn and use new analytics skills to extract more specialized insights. Unlike existing methods that require users to manually decide which data analytics method to apply, AgentAda automatically identifies the skill needed from a library of analytical skills to perform the analysis. This also allows AgentAda to use skills that existing LLMs cannot perform out of the box. The library covers a range of methods, including clustering, predictive modeling, and NLP techniques like BERT, which allow AgentAda to handle complex analytics tasks based on what the user needs. AgentAda's dataset-to-insight extraction strategy consists of three key steps: (I) a question generator to generate queries relevant to the user's goal and persona, (II) a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based skill matcher to choose the best data analytics skill from the skill library, and (III) a code generator that produces executable code based on the retrieved skill's documentation to extract key patterns. We also introduce KaggleBench, a benchmark of curated notebooks across diverse domains, to evaluate AgentAda's performance. We conducted a human evaluation demonstrating that AgentAda provides more insightful analytics than existing tools, with 48.78% of evaluators preferring its analyses, compared to 27.67% for the unskilled agent. We also propose a novel LLM-as-a-judge approach that we show is aligned with human evaluation as a way to automate insight quality evaluation at larger scale.

Abstract: To explore the relationship between dependency distance (DD) and hierarchical distance (HD) in Japanese, we compared the probability distributions of DD and HD with and without sentence length fixed, and analyzed the changes in mean dependency distance (MDD) and mean hierarchical distance (MHD) as sentence length increases, along with their correlation coefficient based on the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese. It was found that the valency of the predicates is the underlying factor behind the trade-off relation between MDD and MHD in Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese regulate the linear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the predicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the threshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the valency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and HD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is greater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability distributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we study lightweight extensions to BERT that refine the [CLS] representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens. Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii) combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach, called MaxPoolBERT, enhances BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without requiring new pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better performance than the standard BERT base model on low resource tasks of the GLUE benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting predefined stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle when stylistic requirements are implicitly represented by a set of examples, such as texts produced by a specific human translator. In this work, we explore various strategies for personalizing automatically generated translations when few examples are available, with a focus on the challenging domain of literary translation. We begin by determining the feasibility of the task and how style information is encoded within model representations. Then, we evaluate various prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, with a particular focus on contrastive steering with sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to identify salient personalization properties. We demonstrate that contrastive SAE steering yields robust style conditioning and translation quality, resulting in higher inference-time computational efficiency than prompting approaches. We further examine the impact of steering on model activations, finding that layers encoding personalization properties are impacted similarly by prompting and SAE steering, suggesting a similar mechanism at play.

Abstract: Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models (LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g., intent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions.

<title>DoctorAgent-RL: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Reinforcement Learning System for Multi-Turn Clinical Dialogue</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Single-round consultation systems require patients to describe all symptoms upfront, leading to vague diagnosis with unclear complaints. Traditional multi-turn dialogue models, constrained by static supervised learning, lack flexibility and fail to intelligently extract key clinical information. To address these limitations, we propose \Ours{}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent, dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient interactions. Experiments demonstrate that \Ours{} outperforms existing models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic performance. This approach shows immense practical value by reducing misdiagnosis risks in time-pressured settings, freeing clinicians for complex cases, and pioneering a strategy to optimize medical resource allocation and alleviate workforce shortages.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Recent thinking models trained with reinforcement learning and backward-checking CoT often suffer from overthinking: they produce excessively long outputs even on simple problems, wasting computation. Existing evaluations, based on token efficiency, give an incomplete view as they neglect problem difficulty and intermediate computation costs. We formalize reasoning efficiency as a relative measure between thinking and instruct models, treating instruct models as the minimal-effort baseline. A systematic study across four thinking models and multiple benchmarks reveals two consistent patterns: (i) instruct models achieve higher efficiency overall, and (ii) problem difficulty affects efficiency, with thinking models wasting computation on easy problems but providing value on harder ones. Building on this insight, we propose COTHINK, a simple two-stage pipeline: an instruct model drafts a brief outline, and a thinking model expands it. On GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, COTHINK cuts token usage by 21.1% while keeping accuracy on four thinking models, and remains competitive with strong efficiency baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and achieved remarkable performance in mathematical problem-solving tasks. Recently, distilling reasoning ability from long-form Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs). Existing studies typically treat SLMs as student models and use long-form CoTs as supervision signals for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to transfer reasoning ability. However, such long-form CoT teachers are usually unaware of the student model's capacity, which limits the effective utilization of the provided reasoning traces. To overcome this limitation, we propose errOr-aware self-ReflectION (ORION), a framework that refines teacher CoTs through an Error-Aware Reflection process. ORION enables the student model to construct more tailored teacher CoTs by refining teacher CoTs and incorporating its own reasoning errors. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ORION consistently improves performance by more than 2% over all baselines. Further analysis reveals that the CoTs constructed by ORION exhibit higher coherence and logical consistency, thereby serving as more effective supervision signals for SFT. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/ORION.git.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons. An anonymized version of DefenderBench is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DefenderBench.

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive, culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior. By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally adaptive LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text embedding models primarily focus on data scaling or synthesis, yet limited exploration of training techniques and data quality, thereby constraining performance. In this work, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a series of versatile and compact embedding models, systematically incentivizing advanced embedding capability in LLMs by superior training techniques and high-quality data. For model architecture, we implement the models on a 0.5B compact size with simple mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings and remove the causal attention mask to enable fully bidirectional representation learning. For training techniques, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline: pre-training on weakly supervised large-scale datasets, fine-tuning with supervised high-quality datasets, and contrastive distillation with fine-grained soft signals, integrated with focal-style reweighting and online hard-negative mixing to emphasize difficult samples and enrich hard negatives, respectively. For training data, we curate over 20 categories for pre-training and 100 categories for fine-tuning and contrastive distillation, to improve both performance and generalization, leveraging task-specific instructions, hard-negative mining, and example-based multi-class labeling to ensure high quality. Combining these techniques, our KaLM-Embedding-V2 series achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, outperforming models of comparable size and rivaling models 3-26x larger, setting a new standard for versatile and compact embedding models under 1B parameters.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as backtracking, self-reflection, and self-correction. Despite these developments, the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence on the final prediction. I.e., errors introduced at this stage can substantially degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed across various state-of-the-art open- and closed-source reasoning models. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in inference cost without sacrificing any accuracy. Our work highlights the central role of the first reasoning step in generating a high-quality reasoning trajectory, and thus enabling significantly efficient sampling.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to large language model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are the cornerstone of the semantic web, offering up-to-date representations of real-world entities and relations. Yet large language models (LLMs) remain largely static after pre-training, causing their internal knowledge to become outdated and limiting their utility in time-sensitive web applications. To bridge this gap between dynamic knowledge and static models, a prevalent approach is to enhance LLMs with KGs. However, prevailing methods typically rely on parameter-invasive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and often degrades LLMs' general capabilities. Moreover, their static integration frameworks cannot keep pace with the continuous evolution of real-world KGs, hindering their deployment in dynamic web environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce KGA (\textit{\underline{K}nowledge \underline{G}raph-guided \underline{A}ttention}), a novel framework that dynamically integrates external KGs into LLMs exclusively at inference-time without any parameter modification. Inspired by research on neuroscience, we rewire the self-attention module by innovatively introducing two synergistic pathways: a \textit{bottom-up knowledge fusion} pathway and a \textit{top-down attention guidance} pathway. The \textit{bottom-up pathway} dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion, which is akin to the \textit{stimulus-driven attention process} in the human brain. Complementarily, the \textit{top-down pathway} aims to assess the contextual relevance of each triple through a \textit{goal-directed verification process}, thereby suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. By synergistically combining these two pathways, our method supports real-time knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks verify KGA's strong fusion performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions; (2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) power numerous AI applications, yet updating their knowledge remains costly. Model editing provides a lightweight alternative through targeted parameter modifications, with meta-learning-based model editing (MLME) demonstrating strong effectiveness and efficiency. However, we find that MLME struggles in low-data regimes and incurs high training costs due to the use of KL divergence. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{Edit (EMSEdit)}$, which leverages multi-step backpropagation (MSBP) to effectively capture gradient-activation mapping patterns within editing samples, performs multi-step edits per sample to enhance editing performance under limited data, and introduces norm-based regularization to preserve unedited knowledge while improving training efficiency. Experiments on two datasets and three LLMs show that EMSEdit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sequential and batch editing. Moreover, MSBP can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches to yield additional performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200 prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions: Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx -1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI) against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural hegemony.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/pixeli99/Prophet.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. To encourage diversity and reduce redundancy, we design a redundancy penalty that discourages repeated similar queries. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/DeepDive.

Abstract: Cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques keep reshaping our view of the world. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) based applications such as ChatGPT have shown the capability of generating human-like conversation on extensive topics. Due to the impressive performance on a variety of language-related tasks (e.g., open-domain question answering, translation, and document summarization), one can envision the far-reaching impacts that can be brought by the LLMs with broader real-world applications (e.g., customer service, education and accessibility, and scientific discovery). Inspired by their success, this paper will offer an overview of state-of-the-art LLMs and their integration into a wide range of academic disciplines, including: (1) arts, letters, and law (e.g., history, philosophy, political science, arts and architecture, law), (2) economics and business (e.g., finance, economics, accounting, marketing), and (3) science and engineering (e.g., mathematics, physics and mechanical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, life sciences and bioengineering, earth sciences and civil engineering, computer science and electrical engineering). Integrating humanity and technology, in this paper, we will explore how LLMs are shaping research and practice in these fields, while also discussing key limitations, open challenges, and future directions in the era of generative AI. The review of how LLMs are engaged across disciplines-along with key observations and insights-can help researchers and practitioners interested in exploiting LLMs to advance their works in diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: KT developed a Responsible AI (RAI) assessment methodology and risk mitigation technologies to ensure the safety and reliability of AI services. By analyzing the Basic Act on AI implementation and global AI governance trends, we established a unique approach for regulatory compliance and systematically identify and manage all potential risk factors from AI development to operation. We present a reliable assessment methodology that systematically verifies model safety and robustness based on KT's AI risk taxonomy tailored to the domestic environment. We also provide practical tools for managing and mitigating identified AI risks. With the release of this report, we also release proprietary Guardrail : SafetyGuard that blocks harmful responses from AI models in real-time, supporting the enhancement of safety in the domestic AI development ecosystem. We also believe these research outcomes provide valuable insights for organizations seeking to develop Responsible AI.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Purpose: Large language models (LLMs) have proven performance for certain diagnostic tasks, however limited studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens for a given diagnosis. Medication management is a complex task that requires synthesis of drug formulation and complete order instructions for safe use. Here, the performance of GPT 4o, an LLM available with ChatGPT, was tested for three medication management tasks. Methods: GPT-4o performance was tested using three medication tasks: identifying available formulations for a given generic drug name, identifying drug-drug interactions (DDI) for a given medication regimen, and preparing a medication order for a given generic drug name. For each experiment, the models raw text response was captured exactly as returned and evaluated using clinician evaluation in addition to standard LLM metrics, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF IDF) vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE 1/ROUGE L F1) between each response and its reference string. Results: For the first task of drug-formulation matching, GPT-4o had 49% accuracy for generic medications being matched to all available formulations, with an average of 1.23 omissions per medication and 1.14 hallucinations per medication. For the second task of drug-drug interaction identification, the accuracy was 54.7% for identifying the DDI pair. For the third task, GPT-4o generated order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors in 65.8% of cases. Conclusions: Model performance for basic medication tasks was consistently poor. This evaluation highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop. CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured, precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$ as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using $\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN) and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression, where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer. Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost} Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function, as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers. \textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and $\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style router function \methodNorm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data. Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization. Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/lens

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks. Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on 56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and 18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all available target data for ranking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on static medical Question Answering (QA) tasks, yet their reasoning often deteriorates in multi-turn clinical dialogues where patient information is scattered across turns. This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.

Abstract: Deception is a pervasive feature of human communication and an emerging concern in large language models (LLMs). While recent studies document instances of LLM deception under pressure, most evaluations remain confined to single-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which deceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce the first simulation framework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences of interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework instantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing tasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and maintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then reviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and open-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with event pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses further reveal distinct strategies of concealment, equivocation, and falsification. Our findings establish deception as an emergent risk in long-horizon interactions and provide a foundation for evaluating future LLMs in real-world, trust-sensitive contexts.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) has achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool module, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal function module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular Question Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal agent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset QRData, the causal agent is 6\% higher than the original SOTA. For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/kairong-han/causal_agent.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems generate real-time transcriptions but often miss nuances that human interpreters capture. While ASR is useful in many contexts, interpreters-who already use ASR tools such as Dragon-add critical value, especially in sensitive settings such as diplomatic meetings where subtle language is key. Human interpreters not only perceive these nuances but can adjust in real time, improving accuracy, while ASR handles basic transcription tasks. However, ASR systems introduce a delay that does not align with real-time interpretation needs. The user-perceived latency of ASR systems differs from that of interpretation because it measures the time between speech and transcription delivery. To address this, we propose a new approach to measuring delay in ASR systems and validate if they are usable in live interpretation scenarios.

Abstract: Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is not always sufficient to capture the full range and complexity of general human preferences. We explore RLHF under a general preference framework by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game in a game-theoretic framework, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous self-play algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or only converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. We provide theoretical analysis that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of synthetic and preference optimization datasets. COMAL is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for preference optimization with minimal changes, and empirically it consistently maintains above 60.2% and 56.8% win rates, when applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B, against all compared algorithms under controlled evaluations.

Abstract: Local citation recommendation (LCR) suggests a set of papers for a citation placeholder within a given context. The task has evolved as generative approaches have become more promising than the traditional pre-fetch and re-rank-based state-of-the-art approaches. This paper introduces citation-specific pre-training within an encoder-decoder architecture, where author-date citation tokens are masked to learn to reconstruct them to fulfill LCR. There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only base scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to learn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the local context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning signal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks except for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the advantage of generative pre-training. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv., with the Refseer benchmark-trained model emerging as the best-performing model. We perform comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, a qualitative analysis, and a taxonomy of hallucinations with detailed statistics. Our analyses confirm that CiteBART-Global has a cross-dataset generalization capability; the macro hallucination rate (MaHR) at the top-3 predictions is 4\%, and when the ground-truth is in the top-k prediction list, the hallucination tendency in the other predictions drops significantly.

Abstract: The optimal bit-width for achieving the best trade-off between quantized model size and accuracy has been a subject of ongoing debate. While some advocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior results. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left such conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified framework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning transition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models stay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning 2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing training schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all previous methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ ternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary 3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters. Extensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization maintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally exceeds 4-bit and binary quantization. Considering hardware constraints, 2-bit quantization offers promising potential for memory reduction and speedup.

<title>Creativity or Brute Force? Using Brainteasers as a Window into the Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use. Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2) generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

<title>Highlighting What Matters: Promptable Embeddings for Attribute-Focused Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

<title>EvolveNav: Empowering LLM-Based Vision-Language Navigation via Self-Improving Embodied Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/IMM-TSF.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a \textbf{Token Importance Recurrence} phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose \textbf{LazyEviction}, an observation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring tokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache by 50\%\textasciitilde70\% while maintaining comparable accuracy, outperforming existing KV cache compression baselines. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/Halo-949/LazyEviction.

arXiv:2506.16552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly to create and scarce in specialized domains (e.g., code) or in complex settings (e.g., requiring reasoning). These practical challenges have sparked growing interest in self-supervised retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next token prediction), we can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens. This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?
  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next token prediction on local and cross-document context through an in-batch attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language modeling. We evaluate Revela on domain-specific (CoIR), reasoning-intensive (BRIGHT), and general-domain (BEIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. Without annotated or synthetic query-document pairs, Revela surpasses larger supervised models and proprietary APIs on CoIR and matches them on BRIGHT. It achieves BEIR's unsupervised SoTA with ~ 1000x less training data and 10x less compute. Performance increases with batch size and model size, highlighting Revela's scalability and its promise for self-supervised retriever learning.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.

<title>Attention-Aware GNN-based Input Defense against Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in various applications, yet their capabilities present risks for both constructive and malicious exploitation. Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and mitigate.
  In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries. Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the graph, thereby enhancing the GNN's capacity to classify the current query as harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics, demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by Dynamic Information Flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37\% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38\% in retrieval recall, and 6.45\% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), a significant gap remains between research and practical deployment. Many studies assess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of the Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an ad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users' information needs in multiple languages. We prepared eleven retrieval models employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual, translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that facilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving effective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a 39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines, including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable, cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.

<title>MoEs Are Stronger than You Think: Hyper-Parallel Inference Scaling with RoE</title>

Abstract: The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction. To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.

Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.

Summary: 
This study focuses on the deployment of large language models as business development agents for persuasive price negotiation in online travel agencies. The agents must adhere to specific operating procedures and business constraints while interacting with customers. Traditional approaches like supervised fine-tuning often fall short in capturing nuanced persuasion styles and enforcing constraints. The proposed Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO) framework uses reinforcement learning to align the language model with various rewards, including human alignment, persuasive behavior, and business constraints. In evaluations, REPO outperforms other methods in improving dialogue quality, achieving a high rate of fixing bad cases and demonstrating emergent capabilities such as proactive empathy and localized reasoning. <div>

Abstract: We study deploying large language models (LLMs) as business development (BD) agents for persuasive price negotiation in online travel agencies (OTAs), where aligning traveler affordability and hotel profitability directly affects bookings, partner relationships, and access to travel. The agent must follow a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while conducting multi-turn persuasion, interpreting colloquial inputs, and adhering to guardrails (no over-promising, no hallucinations). Conventional post-training -- supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or single-source reward optimization -- overfits scripts, misses nuanced persuasive style, and fails to enforce verifiable business constraints.
  We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards: a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics, formatting, and guardrails. A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve negotiation quality. In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); +0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to 66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO. We also observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning, calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in detecting demographic-targeted social biases in web-scraped text corpora.
- Previous research on bias detection in text datasets is limited in scope, often focusing on single content types and demographic axes.
- The study introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for bias detection using a demographic-focused taxonomy.
- Different techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning, are evaluated across twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics.
- While fine-tuned smaller models show promise for scalable bias detection, gaps are identified in detecting biases across demographic axes and multiple demographics simultaneously, highlighting the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection. However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and scalable auditing frameworks.

<br />
Large language models are generating natural language rationales for patent classification tasks, but these rationales may contain errors and misalignments. To address this issue, a new framework called Self-Filtered Distillation is proposed. This framework treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth labels and uses three unsupervised trust metrics to guide the distillation process. These metrics evaluate the stability of rationales, semantic coherence with patent class definitions, and the plausibility of rationale-label pairs. By integrating these metrics into a unified trust score, the framework prioritizes high-trust training samples while optionally filtering out low-trust cases. Experimental results on a patent classification dataset show that the proposed method outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation in terms of accuracy, stability, and interpretability. This approach establishes a reliable method for leveraging reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors, label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation, a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision. The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the ability to implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations, as demonstrated through linear modeling of math problem difficulty using final-token representations. Specific attention heads in the final Transformer layer have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems, indicating a perception of difficulty. Ablation experiments confirm the accuracy of the attention heads' location. LLMs can serve as automatic difficulty annotators, reducing the need for human labeling in benchmark construction and curriculum learning. Additionally, a significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level was observed. This study reveals that LLMs not only perceive difficulty but also have a structured organization in their difficulty perception, providing theoretical insights and practical implications for future research. The code for the experiments is available at https://github.com/Aegis1863/Difficulty-Perception-of-LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators, potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level. Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical directions for future research.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on enhancing the training of large language models using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. A new metric, Token Hidden Reward (THR), is introduced to quantify each token's impact on correct responses during training. This metric plays a crucial role in balancing exploration and exploitation in the learning process. By identifying tokens with high absolute THR values, the study shows that positive THR values promote exploitation by increasing confidence in correct outputs, whereas negative THR values prioritize exploration by preserving probability mass for alternative outputs. An algorithm is proposed that leverages THR values to adjust learning signals and bias training towards either exploration or exploitation, leading to improved accuracy in various math reasoning tasks. The algorithm is shown to be effective across different architectures and RL objectives, offering a targeted approach to fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation, question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly evolving area.

Summary:
This study investigates how emotional framing affects fallacious arguments and convincingness in public communication. By using large language models (LLMs), researchers systematically explored the impact of emotional appeals on fallacies and convincingness. The experiment involved injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while maintaining logical structures. The results showed that LLM-driven emotional framing significantly lowered human fallacy detection by 14.5%. Interestingly, participants were more adept at detecting fallacies when emotions of enjoyment were present compared to fear or sadness. Furthermore, enjoyment, fear, and sadness were found to be correlated with higher convincingness in arguments than neutral or other emotional states. The study offers insights into the role of AI-driven emotional manipulation in the realm of fallacious argumentation. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Emotional framing influences the detection of fallacies in arguments, with LLM-driven appeals reducing detection rates by 14.5%. 
- Enjoyment as an emotion leads to better fallacy detection compared to fear or sadness. 
- Emotional states of enjoyment, fear, and sadness are associated with higher convincingness in arguments. 
- LLMs play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of emotional manipulation in fallacious communication. <div>
arXiv:2510.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation in the context of fallacious argumentation.

Summary:  
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a tendency to generate absurd patterns when tasked with identifying regularities in number series. While successful in identifying patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, LLMs often incorrectly recognize patterns in randomly generated series. This issue persists in multi-step reasoning models, indicating potential limitations in their logical reasoning capabilities. The tendency to perceive non-existent patterns raises concerns about the reliability of LLMs in real-world tasks requiring logical coherence. This study highlights the need to evaluate LLMs' logical consistency and consider countermeasures to address their tendency to generate inaccurate patterns. <div>

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

<div> semantic filtering, conflict-free framework, retrieval-augmented generation, trustworthiness, generation robustness <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The first stage involves joint filtering using semantic and cluster-based methods guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE) to selectively add valuable documents. The second stage includes an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module that analyzes semantic consistency to filter out contradictions. This approach aims to preserve useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, enhancing generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Experimental results across various large language models and datasets show that the proposed SeCon-RAG outperforms existing defense methods significantly. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.

<div> framework, Knowledge Graph Completion, Large Language Models, semantic transfer, ontology-guided class constraints

Summary:
ReaLM is a new framework that addresses the challenge of integrating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings with Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). It uses residual vector quantization to discretize KG embeddings and integrate them into LLM vocabularies. This allows for seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual knowledge, enhancing semantic transfer. ReaLM also incorporates ontology-guided class constraints to ensure semantic consistency in entity predictions based on class-level compatibility. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that ReaLM outperforms existing methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for aligning structured knowledge with LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance. To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language models.

<div> ciphered reasoning, harmful AI actions, CoT monitoring, adversarial attacks, model accuracy

Summary: 
Ciphered reasoning, used to evade Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring for detecting harmful AI actions, was tested on models with various ciphers. While models could accurately translate ciphered text to English, their reasoning accuracy dropped significantly in ciphered text. Frontier models struggled with lesser-known ciphers but performed well in well-known ciphers like rot13. Ciphered reasoning capability improved slowly with more fine-tuning data, and its effectiveness correlated with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. Overall, evading CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning may not be effective for current models, providing insight for future model development. <div>
arXiv:2510.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption. Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents by integrating long-term memory. Existing approaches lack mechanisms for updating memory as user behaviors evolve. PAMU combines sliding window averages and exponential moving averages to create a preference-aware representation that captures short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies. Experimental results on LoCoMo dataset task scenarios demonstrate PAMU's ability to significantly enhance the output quality of LLM in five baselines, particularly in long-term conversations. <div>

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW) with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its effectiveness in long-term conversations.

Summary: 
Automated resume information extraction is crucial for efficient talent acquisition but faces challenges such as varied resume layouts and content, high costs and latency of large language models (LLMs), and lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools. This work presents a layout-aware and efficiency-optimized framework that tackles these challenges. The system combines a fine-tuned layout parser, an inference-efficient LLM extractor, and a two-stage automated evaluation framework with new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show the framework surpasses strong baselines in accuracy and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves high accuracy while reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully operational in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

Summary:
EVisRAG is introduced as an end-to-end framework for reasoning with evidence-guided multi-image. The model first observes retrieved images, records per-image evidence, and derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. A novel training method, Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO), is proposed to optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities. Experimental results on visual question answering benchmarks show that EVisRAG outperforms backbone VLM with a substantial 27% improvement on average. The model enhances answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images, resembling a real detective in its approach. <div>

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models (VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs. Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

Summary: 
The research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response accuracy tasks. 54 LLMs were tested for scoring responses against ground truth answers. The two-step methodology includes a correlation test and a human-likeness test using z-scores to identify judgment patterns. 27 out of 54 LLMs achieved Tier 1 performance, with 23 models exhibiting human-like judgment and 4 models showing super-consistent behavior. The study found that judge excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training strategies. Key contributions include the inadequacy of correlation for judge evaluation, the introduction of a "Turing Test for judges," and the establishment of a standardized benchmark for classifying LLM judges into performance tiers. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns: human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1 performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11 closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different evaluation needs.

Summary:
The article introduces Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that utilizes the position bias of large language models as a diagnostic signal to identify relevant content in multi-document contexts. By reordering documents and observing shifts in the model's responses, the framework efficiently identifies the most relevant information. The problem of choosing reorderings is framed as a bipartite matching problem, with a proposed greedy strategy achieving comparable performance to the optimal assignment computed with the Hungarian algorithm. This approach significantly reduces computational cost without the need for model retraining, identifying relevant documents using up to 65% fewer language model queries than random permutation baselines. The study showcases the transformation of inherent biases in language models from liabilities into assets for efficient inference-time optimization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated, we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem. While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$ strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds. PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines (60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all categories.

Summary:
RISE introduces a geometric approach called Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation that represents semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding space. This method leverages the manifold structure of modern language representations to provide interpretable geometric properties. The study evaluates RISE across multiple embedding models, datasets, and languages and demonstrates its ability to map discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features across languages and models. The results suggest the existence of cross-lingual geometric structure and support the Linear Representation Hypothesis at the sentence level. This work highlights the importance of understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships for model interpretability and control. <div>

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' + ''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations. RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features (e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis at the sentence level.

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering (QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

It identifies a need for new evaluations that cover overlooked aspects of narrative understanding not well aligned with current metrics. Only 27% of narrative tasks are adequately covered by existing benchmarks, with certain areas such as narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation lacking representation. There is a call for the development of benchmarks that can assess subjective and perspectival aspects of narratives where there may not be a single correct answer. The findings of this study will benefit NLP researchers looking to test language models' narrative understanding capabilities.

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area. We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas -- including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, conversational biases, adversarial attacks, bias amplification, ethical behavior <br />
Summary: <br />
This study introduces CoBia, a suite of adversarial attacks to analyze how Large Language Models (LLMs) deviate from normative behavior in conversations. By creating biased conversation scenarios, the researchers evaluate 11 LLMs' responses related to various socio-demographic categories. The results show that LLMs often amplify bias and struggle to reject biased follow-up questions, highlighting the presence of deeply embedded biases. The study emphasizes the importance of stress-testing models to assess their reliability and alignment with ethical standards. The findings suggest that improvements are needed in model construction to prevent harmful behavior like expressing racist viewpoints in conversations. The code and artifacts used in the study are available for further examination on GitHub. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails, allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks. However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race, religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.

<div> BERT, iBERT, interpretable, embeddings, style

Summary: 
iBERT is introduced as an encoder that aims to produce interpretable and controllable embeddings by modularizing and exposing discriminative cues in language. It represents each input token as a sparse, non-negative mixture over context-independent sense vectors, allowing for modular control over representation. The model's interpretability is demonstrated through evaluations on style-focused tasks, showing an improvement in style representation effectiveness on the STEL benchmark and competitive performance on authorship verification. iBERT's modular structure enables the assignment of specific style attributes to individual sense vectors, such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling. While the experiments focus on style, iBERT is designed to interpretably decompose diverse discriminative signals in the data, facilitating generalization even when supervision encompasses both stylistic and semantic factors. <div>

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and semantic factors.

<div> sparse attention, large reasoning models, DELTA, computational efficiency, model accuracy

Summary:
DELTA is a new sparse attention mechanism designed to improve the computational efficiency of large reasoning models (LRMs) without compromising model accuracy. It partitions transformer layers into three groups: initial layers using full attention, selection layers identifying salient tokens, and sparse-attention layers attending only to selected tokens. By selectively reusing attention maps, DELTA achieves up to 5x reduction in attended tokens while delivering a 1.5x end-to-end speedup on reasoning tasks like AIME and GPQA-Diamond. The approach maintains the full key-value (KV) cache for accuracy, addressing the accuracy degradation and dynamic importance challenges faced by existing sparse attention methods. DELTA's performance matches or surpasses that of full attention models on reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its efficacy in efficient long-context reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present \textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering $1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context reasoning.

<title>Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs</title>

<div> fine-tuning, large language models, autoregressive, masked diffusion, knowledge injection 
Summary:
Fine-tuning autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) faces challenges such as the "reversal curse," hindering knowledge injection. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) show promise in overcoming these limitations, proving more data-efficient and immune to the reversal curse during pre-training. By evaluating arLLMs and dLLMs on various datasets with forward and backward Question Answering (QA), researchers found that dLLMs outperformed arLLMs without the need for data augmentation via paraphrases. Additionally, a novel masked fine-tuning method was introduced to enhance knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs, improving data efficiency and bridging the performance gap between arLLMs and dLLMs. This study highlights the potential of dLLMs in knowledge acquisition and suggests promising avenues for further research in language modeling. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training. However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs, evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

<div> abductive preference learning, large language models, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, prompt discrimination, counterfactual prompts<br />
Summary:<br />
Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet, even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), tend to be overconfident and provide the same conservative response to different prompts. This failure is attributed to the neglect of counterfactual prompts in existing preference learning. To address this, abductive preference learning is proposed, reversing the conventional conditioning by learning preferences over prompts given a response. Experiments using an abductive dataset derived from HaluEval QA benchmark show that abductive methods improve prompt discrimination, standard methods improve response selection, and multitask objectives unify both, boosting accuracy in both response selection and prompt discrimination. Evaluation on AlpacaEval confirms that abductive preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference optimization while addressing the challenge of counterfactual prompts. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance, they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt, while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries, implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to $99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual prompts.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a brain-inspired framework called HIPPD for personality detection from text. HIPPD mimics the hierarchical information processing of the human brain by using a large language model to simulate the cerebral cortex for global semantic reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, resembling the prefrontal cortex, is incorporated for adaptive gating and feature retention based on dopaminergic prediction error feedback. Specialized lightweight models, acting like the basal ganglia, are dynamically routed to capture personality-related patterns efficiently. HIPPD outperforms existing machine learning approaches on Kaggle and Pandora datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in extracting robust features in semantically sparse environments. <div>

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<div> collaboration, language models, switch generation, model training, model performance

Summary: 
Model collaboration in language model training can balance different skills by having models work together. The Switch Generation approach involves a switcher LM that alternates between different model versions to generate responses. This method outperforms individual models and other collaboration baselines on a wide range of tasks. Switch Generation improves model performance by 12.9% on average. The approach allows for the discovery of compositional skills that can solve challenging problems and enables generalization to unseen models and tasks. It also leverages by-products from expensive training pipelines, reducing waste and maximizing the use of resources. <div>
arXiv:2510.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to ``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks, reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that are otherwise discarded.

<div> keywords: abstractive summarization, large language models, fine-tuning, hallucinations, span-level annotations

Summary: 
Fine-tuning strategies are explored to improve the faithfulness of abstractive summarization generated by large language models (LLMs). Existing mitigation techniques for unfaithful summaries are insufficient, prompting the investigation of new methods. The study introduces a dataset comprising faithful and unfaithful summaries with span-level annotations. Three fine-tuning techniques - gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation - are evaluated to enhance model faithfulness. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of all three approaches, with unlikelihood training proving to be the most successful. By leveraging span-level annotations to identify and address hallucinations in LLM-generated summaries, the study showcases the potential for improving the quality and accuracy of abstractive summarization outputs. <div>
arXiv:2510.09915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries, introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the detection of hateful memes, emphasizing the importance of understanding what makes a meme hateful. It highlights two key features of hateful memes: the presence of a presupposed context and the expression of false claims. To address this, the authors propose the SHIELD framework, which combines the PCM model for capturing contextual information and the FACT module for identifying false claims using external knowledge and cross-modal reference graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that SHIELD outperforms existing methods in detecting hateful memes across various datasets and metrics. Additionally, the framework shows versatility in tasks such as fake news detection. <div>
arXiv:2510.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate, causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of \textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM} for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims, we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce \textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

Summary:  
Tokenization is a crucial step in large language models (LLMs), but current metrics like fertility do not fully capture how vocabularies are distributed across languages and domains. This study analyzed six tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, revealing stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, and domain-insensitive results. The proposed Single Token Retention Rate (STRR) measures the proportion of words preserved as single tokens, providing insights into language prioritization and fairness. Results show systematic favoritism towards English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi. STRR complements fertility metrics and offers guidelines for more equitable multilingual tokenizer design. <div>

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models (LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word), captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

This paper introduces a unified framework for deliberative tree search in Large Language Models, addressing the ambiguity regarding the role of the reward signal. The framework deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: Search Mechanism, Reward Formulation, and Transition Function. It distinguishes between transient Search Guidance for Test-Time Scaling and durable Parametric Reward Modeling for Self-Improvement.

arXiv:2510.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model (LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers: \textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the \emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach for speech-to-speech translation by incorporating multi-token prediction (MTP) loss into the process. This new method aims to improve the density of semantic information in the translation by predicting multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thus capturing more complete semantics. Initial implementations of MTP focused on the final layer, but the authors propose a new MTP-S2UT loss that applies the MTP loss to hidden representations at the stage where CTC loss is computed. Experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently improves the quality of S2UT translations, with MTP-S2UT yielding the best performance. This advancement in information enrichment allows for earlier and more effective enhancement of hidden representations, leading to more accurate and dense semantic translations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late. We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

Summary:
The article introduces a new search agent, ExpandSearch, that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to enhance query expansion for multi-hop question-answering tasks. By incorporating a pre-trained squeezer model to assist in understanding retrieved documents, the search agent can focus on generating effective queries for improved retrieval recall. Experimental results across seven QA benchmarks show that ExpandSearch achieves a 4.4% average improvement over existing baselines, particularly excelling in tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation for multi-hop reasoning. This approach demonstrates that even a smaller-scale 3B LLM can effectively enhance search capabilities and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in complex QA tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason, search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks. To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

Summary:
Long Chain-of-Thought prompting for structured inference with large language models has revealed a vulnerability known as Path Drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate from aligned paths, violating safety constraints. Three triggers of Path Drift were identified: goal-driven reasoning delays, ethical evaporation bypasses alignment checkpoints, and condition chain escalation leads to unsafe completions. A Path Drift Induction Framework was introduced to address these triggers, reducing refusal rates. A path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution correction and reflective safety cues is proposed to mitigate risks. The study underscores the importance of trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form reasoning beyond token-level alignment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming, and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates, while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks, we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

Summary:
This study explores the use of compact encoders for medical abstract classification, addressing the challenges of deploying large language models in health settings with strict constraints. The researchers fine-tuned BERT base and DistilBERT using different loss functions and found that DistilBERT with plain cross-entropy performed best on the test set while requiring fewer parameters than BERT base. The study includes accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1 metrics, as well as confusion analyses to identify error patterns. The results suggest starting with a compact encoder and cross-entropy for efficient deployment, followed by calibration and task-specific optimizations before considering heavier models. This approach offers a practical default for leveraging language models in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1, release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before moving to heavier models.

<div> Framework, Human performance, Text embeddings, Model evaluation, Benchmark <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces HUME, a Human Evaluation Framework for Text Embeddings, to compare human and model performance on embedding tasks. Human performance is measured across 16 datasets covering tasks like reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity in various languages. The study finds that humans achieve an average performance of 77.6%, slightly below the best model's 80.1%. Model performance varies significantly across different datasets, with some reaching near-optimal performance and others struggling, especially in low-resource languages. The research provides insights into task difficulty patterns, highlights dataset issues, and underscores the importance of considering human performance in evaluating text embedding models. The framework aims to enhance the interpretability of model scores, inform model development, and improve benchmarking in the field of text embeddings. <div>

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However, such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages. Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset, and leaderboard are publicly available at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.

Summary:<br /><br />Deep learning has significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) but has struggled with interpretability in fields like healthcare and finance. Current NLP models lack the ability to tie predictions to human concepts in an interpretable way. The Concept Language Model Network (CLMN) introduces a novel neural-symbolic framework that maintains both performance and interpretability. By representing concepts as continuous embeddings and using fuzzy-logic reasoning to model concept interactions, CLMN improves explanation quality while achieving higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods. By integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space, CLMN demonstrates the potential for practical and transparent NLP systems in various applications. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited, especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical, transparent NLP systems.

<div> legal reasoning, large language model, Unilaw-R1, dataset, two-stage training strategy <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Unilaw-R1, a large language model specifically designed for legal reasoning tasks. By utilizing a 7-billion parameter scale, Unilaw-R1 aims to address common challenges in the legal domain such as inadequate legal knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To enhance its capabilities, the model is trained using a two-stage approach that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Additionally, a high-quality dataset called Unilaw-R1-Data containing chain-of-thought samples is created to facilitate training. Evaluations on legal reasoning tasks using Unilaw-R1-Eval benchmark show that Unilaw-R1 outperforms models of similar scales and achieves comparable performance to larger models. Through domain-specific training, Unilaw-R1 demonstrates significant improvements on authoritative benchmarks like LawBench and LexEval, showcasing its effectiveness in legal AI applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

<div> intent-driven, preference optimization, diversity, robustness, alignment
<br />
A-IPO introduces an intention module to infer latent user intentions in prompts and incorporate them into the reward function for better alignment. It enhances preference optimization by considering diverse user intents, leading to a clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses. The model demonstrates improved performance on real-world and adversarial preference alignment benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines in win-rate, response similarity, and defense success rate. By explicitly modeling diverse user intentions,A-IPO promotes pluralistic preference optimization and enhances adversarial robustness in alignment tasks. The empirical evaluation showcases significant improvements across key metrics, including Response-Intention Consistency, Intention Consistency Score, and Defense Success Rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of A-IPO in capturing varied user preferences and improving alignment outcomes.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference \textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of $\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6 Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

Summary:<br />
- Document summarization requires personalized approaches due to subjectivity. <br />
- A lack of diverse training data hinders personalized summarization model training. <br />
- The PerAugy technique enhances accuracy by perturbing summary content and shuffling trajectories. <br />
- State-of-the-art summarizer frameworks benefit from augmented user-encoders, improving personalization. <br />
- Dataset diversity metrics (TP, RTC, DegreeD) positively impact user-encoder performance, indicating the importance of diversity in driving improvement. <div>
arXiv:2510.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However, training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging, particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t. PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics -- $\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity. We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving performance gains.

<div> REFRAIN, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, overthinking, adaptive inference, stop discriminator<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces REFRAIN, a framework designed to prevent overthinking in large language models (LLMs) by determining when to stop reasoning during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. REFRAIN utilizes a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective but redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB) controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds based on problem difficulty without the need for training or fine-tuning. Testing on various benchmarks and model families shows that REFRAIN reduces token usage by 20-55% while maintaining or even improving accuracy compared to traditional CoT prompting. Ablation and robustness analyses confirm its stability across different models, scorers, and prompt variations. This highlights the significance of knowing when to stop as a practical means of test-time scaling, allowing models to reason effectively without excessive or redundant processing. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps. However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking. REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB) multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling -- enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Large Language Models, Graph-based, Tri-Graph, Passage Retrieval

Summary:
LinearRAG proposes a new framework for improving the retrieval performance of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. It addresses the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing a hierarchical graph structure called Tri-Graph, constructed through lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking. This approach eliminates the need for unstable relation extraction, leading to more reliable graph construction. The LinearRAG framework offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for indexing large-scale, unstructured corpora. In terms of retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy involving relevant entity activation and passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LinearRAG compared to baseline models. Overall, LinearRAG shows promise in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

Summary:
The paper introduces a systematic framework for information extraction from copy-heavy documents, leveraging OCR engines and Large Language Models to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional approaches, the framework strategically selects methods based on document-specific characteristics, leading to significant performance improvements. Evaluation across various extraction paradigms and document formats shows exceptional accuracy and low latency, particularly in table-based extraction methods. The adaptive framework achieves F1=1.0 accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents and F1=0.997 accuracy with 0.6s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR. This approach not only enhances identity extraction tasks but also sets a general principle that repetitive tasks can be optimized by selecting structure-aware methods, transforming computational burdens into opportunities for efficiency improvement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions, our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0 accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction, this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

Summary:
Direct-Answer (DA) prompting is compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for eight LLMs, showing a significant reduction in measured unfairness with DA. A token-to-head contribution score is introduced to identify bias heads in LLMs, revealing a causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. DiffHeads, a debiasing framework, is proposed to selectively mask bias heads based on the insights gained. DiffHeads reduces unfairness without compromising model utility, showcasing the effectiveness of addressing bias at the attention head level. <div>
arXiv:2510.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA) prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open- and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues. Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally, building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces BILLY, a framework aimed at enhancing large language models' creativity by blending persona vectors within a single model. BILLY eliminates the need for costly multi-LLM systems by integrating diverse perspectives and specialized expertise into the activation space. Through the merging of distinct persona vectors, BILLY guides the model's generation process to produce multi-perspective outputs without explicit communication between models. Experimental results demonstrate that BILLY outperforms single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches while reducing inference time and computational costs significantly. Analyses show that blending persona vectors allows for effective control over different aspects of generation and enhances interpretability. <div>

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks, such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference, enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater interpretability.

Summary:
The survey explores provenance tracking for content generated by large language models (LLMs) in the field of artificial intelligence. It focuses on four dimensions: Model Sourcing, Model Structure Sourcing, Training Data Sourcing, and External Data Sourcing. Model Sourcing distinguishes content generated by LLMs from human-authored content, while Model Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms of the models. Training Data Sourcing traces generated content back to the training data used by the model, while External Data Sourcing identifies external information influencing the model's responses. The survey also introduces a taxonomy categorizing sourcing methods as prior-based or posterior-based approaches. This framework enhances transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness in deploying LLMs for subjective decision-making tasks. <br /><br />Summary: The survey on provenance tracking for content generated by large language models explores dimensions of model and data sourcing, highlighting the importance of traceability in ensuring transparency and accountability in AI deployment. <div>
arXiv:2510.10161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g., recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning, decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare, finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying external information used to support or influence the responses of model. Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types, which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs. First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then, current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks, providing a solid foundation for future research.

<div> evaluation, language model, medical consultations, multi-agent systems, reasoning pathway

Summary:
A study evaluated large language model-based multi-agent systems in simulating medical consultations by focusing on the reasoning pathways rather than just final-answer accuracy. Through analyzing 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and six multi-agent frameworks, the study identified four dominant failure patterns: flawed consensus due to shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis. The research emphasized the importance of transparent and auditable reasoning processes in the development and deployment of medical AI to ensure clinical and public trust.

arXiv:2510.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway? The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks. Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns: flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

<div> Parameter-efficient fine-tuning, large language models, noisy labels, Delora, sample selection <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Delora, a framework designed to address the issue of noisy labels in training data for large language models. Delora decouples sample selection from model training by using a noisy label detector called clean and noisy LoRA. The clean LoRA memorizes clean data, while the noisy LoRA is trained to memorize mislabeled data, serving as a threshold for selecting clean and noisy samples. This approach aims to break the cycle of suboptimal performance caused by inaccurate initial selections. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Delora in both noisy label detection and text classification. <div>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle, we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

<div> adaptation, language models, test-time, uncertainty signals, domain-specific

Summary:
Test-time adaptation for language models in specialized domains is crucial due to significant distribution shifts. A new framework, SyTTA, enables on-the-fly model adaptation without additional supervision by utilizing input-side perplexity and output-side predictive entropy as uncertainty signals. SyTTA consistently improves model performance across various architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, showcasing significant gains in agricultural question answering tasks. Notably, SyTTA enhances Rouge-LSum by over 120% on specific benchmarks with minimal additional tokens per query. These results demonstrate the feasibility of effective test-time adaptation for language models without the need for labeled examples, facilitating deployment in expertise-limited domains.

arXiv:2510.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy, indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query. These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

<div> Keywords: Unsupervised text representation learning, generative framework, token alignment, target token distribution, MTEB v2 benchmark.

Summary: 
Text representation learning is essential in natural language processing, benefiting search and recommendation systems using unlabeled text data. A new generative framework called Text2Token is introduced, focusing on token target prediction with carefully constructed target token distributions. By analyzing token-alignment properties and identifying key token categories, Text2Token constructs synthetic token targets through data-driven and model-derived methods. Empirical results on the MTEB v2 benchmark show Text2Token's competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art embedder LLM2Vec. The study reveals that vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together during training, shedding light on future research directions.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

<div> Supervised neural method, Coreference Resolution, Large Language Models, ImCoref-CeS framework, performance improvement 
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the ImCoref-CeS framework, which combines an enhanced supervised model with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Coreference Resolution (CR) in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The ImCoref model enhances the supervised neural method by introducing a bridging module for long-text encoding, a biaffine scorer for positional information, and a hybrid mention regularization for training efficiency. The framework also incorporates an LLM acting as a Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions and coreference results predicted by ImCoref. Extensive experiments show that ImCoref-CeS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CR tasks. The proposed framework effectively integrates the strengths of supervised neural methods and LLMs, leading to significant performance improvements in coreference resolution.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose \textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method (\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS, which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding.

<title>Backdoor Collapse: Eliminating Unknown Threats via Known Backdoor Aggregation in Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs), often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first}, aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and \textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I) \ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$. (II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in practical deployment scenarios.

<title>On the Entity-Level Alignment in Crosslingual Consistency</title>

arXiv:2510.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks, and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling, wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However, emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture, and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model, but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB, with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs 176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks -- RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) -- and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation of this critical capability.

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further, AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance, and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

<title>STEAM: A Semantic-Level Knowledge Editing Framework for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static, reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam} improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at https://github.com/GY-Jeong/STEAM.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings. Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension: fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent. Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models (LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict. In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management, where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance. We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by 14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA. RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

<title>Steering Over-refusals Towards Safety in Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals -- where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical, and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement / contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce \textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines while preserving legitimate refusals.

<title>End-to-end Speech Recognition with similar length speech and text</title>

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS) was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b) Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the number of frames.

<title>Rethinking LLM Evaluation: Can We Evaluate LLMs with 200x Less Data?</title>

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5% using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within 5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction, enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the "digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models (LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts. Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200 semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

<title>FML-bench: A Benchmark for Automatic ML Research Agents Highlighting the Importance of Exploration Breadth</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However, comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor, creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden, emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/qrzou/FML-bench.

<title>When or What? Understanding Consumer Engagement on Digital Platforms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience engagement strategies.

<title>Assessing Large Language Models for Structured Medical Order Extraction</title>

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission, which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering, can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights, we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that, in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale context via efficient post-training.

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our work.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably, AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task. Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage. To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues, thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in 31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise, their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

<title>BitMar: Low-Bit Multimodal Fusion with Episodic Memory for Edge Devices</title>

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off, delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for edge deployment.

<title>Dynamic Topic Evolution with Temporal Decay and Attention in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis, enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in \href{https://github.com/BokwaiHo/COLA.git}{Link}.

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226 English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence), whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to the study of media bias.

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel, making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&amp;Executor merging strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX) while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust, scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing. In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities. Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally, we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for more interactive and scalable web agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual benchmark extension and release our codes to support future research.

<title>RePro: Training Language Models to Faithfully Recycle the Web for Pretraining</title>

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models (LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on 22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at https://github.com/cxcscmu/RePro.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a nuanced and often misinterpreted form of communication, especially in text, where tone and body language are absent. This paper proposes a modular deep learning framework for sarcasm detection, leveraging Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and contextual models such as BERT to analyze linguistic, emotional, and contextual cues. The system integrates sentiment analysis, contextual embeddings, linguistic feature extraction, and emotion detection through a multi-layer architecture. While the model is in the conceptual stage, it demonstrates feasibility for real-world applications such as chatbots and social media analysis.

<title>Large Language Models for Full-Text Methods Assessment: A Case Study on Mediation Analysis</title>

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here, using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180 full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

arXiv:2510.10776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles, social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types. Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages, specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language processing.

<title>Review of Inference-Time Scaling Strategies: Reasoning, Search and RAG</title>

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods. Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies, including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO), and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity, trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

<title>Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to better utilization of the model.

<title>DUAL-Bench: Measuring Over-Refusal and Robustness in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10846</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms, while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18 VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs, including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity when deploying Text2SQL systems.

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention, affording users greater control and customization over the research process. Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length, highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

arXiv:2510.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability. However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

<title>GapDNER: A Gap-Aware Grid Tagging Model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence (AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models. However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more "jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy (2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch implementation to facilitate further research.

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms head-child identification. We release (1) a reproducible pipeline that preserves punctuation as sibling nodes prior to binarization, (2) derived artifacts and metadata (intermediate @X markers, reversibility signatures, alignment indices), and (3) an accompanying evaluation suite covering head-child prediction, round-trip reversibility, and structural compatibility with derivational resources (CCGbank). On the Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware preprocessing improves head prediction accuracy from 73.66\% (Collins rules) and 86.66\% (MLP) to 91.85\% with the same classifier, and achieves competitive alignment against CCGbank derivations. All code, configuration files, and documentation are released to enable replication and extension to other corpora.

<title>KOTOX: A Korean Toxic Dataset for Deobfuscation and Detoxification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English, leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a \textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

arXiv:2510.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in false premise recognition.

<title>RV-HATE: Reinforced Multi-Module Voting for Implicit Hate Speech Detection</title>

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset. RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset. Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

<title>Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning via Selective Critical Token Fine-Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10974</link>

arXiv:2510.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens, neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration. These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient and robust LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash, DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring, particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles. To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST (Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates, highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains like hiring.

<title>DND: Boosting Large Language Models with Dynamic Nested Depth</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11001</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer, DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by 0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g., arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation & Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3) Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated reasoning skills.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&amp;A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27 specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&amp;A items) and DotaBench (74 multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM development

<title>Latent Refinement Decoding: Enhancing Diffusion-Based Language Models by Refining Belief States</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11052</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11052</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

<title>Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Non-Human-Like Reasoning Path Preference Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11104</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative, non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance. Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that, with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

arXiv:2510.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

<title>One Size Does Not Fit All: Exploring Variable Thresholds for Distance-Based Multi-Label Text Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11160</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11160</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits, including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets, and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity distributions show statistically significant differences across models, datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5 thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance even with limited labeled examples.

<title>Bridging Gaps in Hate Speech Detection: Meta-Collections and Benchmarks for Low-Resource Iberian Languages</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11167</link>

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time, large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably, a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover, we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in underrepresented European languages.

<title>Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

<title>Discursive Circuits: How Do Language Models Understand Discourse Relations?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning. To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery. Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model) recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT. Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g., coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

arXiv:2510.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context (QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval, along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and enterprise knowledge bases.

<title>The Curious Case of Factual (Mis)Alignment between LLMs' Short- and Long-Form Answers</title>

arXiv:2510.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\% accuracy drop.

<title>Fairness Metric Design Exploration in Multi-Domain Moral Sentiment Classification using Transformer-Based Models</title>

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by 14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of 0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency (MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC = 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers: supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning (GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our experiments are publicly available.

Abstract: Depression is a pressing global public health issue, yet publicly available Chinese-language resources for risk detection remain scarce and are mostly limited to binary classification. To address this limitation, we release CNSocialDepress, a benchmark dataset for depression risk detection from Chinese social media posts. The dataset contains 44,178 texts from 233 users, within which psychological experts annotated 10,306 depression-related segments. CNSocialDepress provides binary risk labels together with structured multi-dimensional psychological attributes, enabling interpretable and fine-grained analysis of depressive signals. Experimental results demonstrate its utility across a wide range of NLP tasks, including structured psychological profiling and fine-tuning of large language models for depression detection. Comprehensive evaluations highlight the dataset's effectiveness and practical value for depression risk identification and psychological analysis, thereby providing insights to mental health applications tailored for Chinese-speaking populations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information. We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits. Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task, automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive self-defense tool for agents.

<title>Do Psychometric Tests Work for Large Language Models? Evaluation of Tests on Sexism, Racism, and Morality</title>

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks, indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

<title>Towards Real-Time Fake News Detection under Evidence Scarcity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11277</link>

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios, where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1) Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2) Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy. Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available: https://github.com/wgyhhhh/EASE.

<title>Emergent Misalignment via In-Context Learning: Narrow in-context examples can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates, i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts. Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility tools.

<title>Do LLMs "Feel"? Emotion Circuits Discovery and Control</title>

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text. This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65% emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

<title>LLM-Specific Utility: A New Perspective for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages, i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings, we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

<title>Stabilizing MoE Reinforcement Learning by Aligning Training and Inference Routers</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions, the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning, especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training. We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

<title>Beyond Survival: Evaluating LLMs in Social Deduction Games with Human-Aligned Strategies</title>

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play, yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens, and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation, which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision. In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1, outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process to all future models.

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning, showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in far more effective estimation.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life, producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism, reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic patterns of generative AI.

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest gap compared with non-CL results.

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing, involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%, respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the $F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and results are publicly available at https://github.com/GianCarloMilanese/llm_pipeline_wi-iat.

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states (Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning (Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable, fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

<title>An Encoder-Integrated PhoBERT with Graph Attention for Vietnamese Token-Level Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19 domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling for improved token classification across multiple domains.

<title>Information-Preserving Reformulation of Reasoning Traces for Antidistillation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks. While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces. Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance, when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a 13.5% degradation.

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages, approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength) and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality), Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices (36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development, constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge. We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and democratizing access to AI benefits.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness. We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

<title>LLMAtKGE: Large Language Models as Explainable Attackers against Knowledge Graph Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters, which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies further validate its capability to generate explanations.

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of Survey Response Generation Methods.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset, enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage, the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly less task-specific data.

arXiv:2510.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space. We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability in user-centric settings.

<title>Deconstructing Attention: Investigating Design Principles for Effective Language Modeling</title>

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states (grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase. Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene, where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment. Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency, addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

<title>Enhancing Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Multi-Path Plan Aggregation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11620</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model (LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

arXiv:2510.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap, we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50 expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains, including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and highlights the challenges of Acadreason.

<title>Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency. (iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy. Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes, 4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness: even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes, including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

Abstract: Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys, especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output. While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical threat: the phenomenon we term the "survey paper DDoS attack" to the research community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to the research community.

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps: (1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse, category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3) applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering, bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting 50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered software engineering systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be able to replace them.

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm, since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However, existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research: data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii) injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales; trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization, explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

<title>The Geometry of Reasoning: Flowing Logics in Representation Space</title>

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes. We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature, enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.

<title>The Personalization Trap: How User Memory Alters Emotional Reasoning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical. We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

<title>Operationalizing AI: Empirical Evidence on MLOps Practices, User Satisfaction, and Organizational Context</title>

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence (AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability, maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development. However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied, MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational settings.

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at https://github.com/hehefan/Translution.

<title>CardRewriter: Leveraging Knowledge Cards for Long-Tail Query Rewriting on Short-Video Platforms</title>

Abstract: Short-video platforms have rapidly become a new generation of information retrieval systems, where users formulate queries to access desired videos. However, user queries, especially long-tail ones, often suffer from spelling errors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, resulting in mismatches between user expectations and retrieved results. While large language models (LLMs) have shown success in long-tail query rewriting within e-commerce, they struggle on short-video platforms, where proprietary content such as short videos, live streams, micro dramas, and user social networks falls outside their training distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific knowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method aggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into an informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM to better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We optimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored reward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline experiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for queries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing further confirms significant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), along with a notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR). Since September 2025, CardRewriter has been deployed on Kuaishou, one of China's largest short-video platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space, and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially harmful and offensive model outputs.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.

<title>A Layered Intuition -- Method Model with Scope Extension for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically. In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions, which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs in real-world problem-solving.

Abstract: This paper introduces Bhasha-Rupantarika, a light and efficient multilingual translation system tailored through algorithm-hardware codesign for resource-limited settings. The method investigates model deployment at sub-octet precision levels (FP8, INT8, INT4, and FP4), with experimental results indicating a 4.1x reduction in model size (FP4) and a 4.2x speedup in inference speed, which correlates with an increased throughput of 66 tokens/s (improvement by 4.8x). This underscores the importance of ultra-low precision quantization for real-time deployment in IoT devices using FPGA accelerators, achieving performance on par with expectations. Our evaluation covers bidirectional translation between Indian and international languages, showcasing its adaptability in low-resource linguistic contexts. The FPGA deployment demonstrated a 1.96x reduction in LUTs and a 1.65x decrease in FFs, resulting in a 2.2x enhancement in throughput compared to OPU and a 4.6x enhancement compared to HPTA. Overall, the evaluation provides a viable solution based on quantisation-aware translation along with hardware efficiency suitable for deployable multilingual AI systems. The entire codes [https://github.com/mukullokhande99/Bhasha-Rupantarika/] and dataset for reproducibility are publicly available, facilitating rapid integration and further development by researchers.

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively. Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge, manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate, introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies. Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns. Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs, while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems, research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static, passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization -- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in practical engineering scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have greatly enhanced multimodal conversational systems. However, existing benchmarks remain limited -- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive environments.

<title>ELMO: Efficiency via Low-precision and Peak Memory Optimization in Large Output Spaces</title>

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification (XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8, without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling. Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations -- gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method, Renee without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution, however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance. EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME 2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels, achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65% fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

<title>Can Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Generalize Across Diverse Domains?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains, enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning (TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination, fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking, tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a path to trusted capability

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations, yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high- and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively, and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7% win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward producing human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X (formerly Twitter), enables users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual notes, and vote on their helpfulness. However, our analysis of 30.8K health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6 hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+, a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance. CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of 1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses. The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense, such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series. Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

Abstract: Neural IR has advanced through two distinct paths: entity-oriented approaches leveraging knowledge graphs and multi-vector models capturing fine-grained semantics. We introduce QDER, a neural re-ranking model that unifies these approaches by integrating knowledge graph semantics into a multi-vector model. QDER's key innovation lies in its modeling of query-document relationships: rather than computing similarity scores on aggregated embeddings, we maintain individual token and entity representations throughout the ranking process, performing aggregation only at the final scoring stage - an approach we call "late aggregation." We first transform these fine-grained representations through learned attention patterns, then apply carefully chosen mathematical operations for precise matches. Experiments across five standard benchmarks show that QDER achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of 36% in nDCG@20 over the strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004 and similar improvements on other datasets. QDER particularly excels on difficult queries, achieving an nDCG@20 of 0.70 where traditional approaches fail completely (nDCG@20 = 0.0), setting a foundation for future work in entity-aware retrieval.

Abstract: Current neural re-rankers often struggle with complex information needs and long, content-rich documents. The fundamental issue is not computational--it is intelligent content selection: identifying what matters in lengthy, multi-faceted texts. While humans naturally anchor their understanding around key entities and concepts, neural models process text within rigid token windows, treating all interactions as equally important and missing critical semantic signals. We introduce REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that mimics human-like understanding by using entities as a "semantic skeleton" to guide attention. REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into the attention mechanism, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic reasoning. This relevance-guided attention enables the model to focus on conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term matches. REGENT achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully integrate entity semantics directly into neural attention, establishing a new paradigm for entity-aware information retrieval.

Abstract: Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a 10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and 37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

arXiv:2510.11683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.

Abstract: Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition effectively alleviates the burden of time-consuming and expensive annotation in the supervised setting. But the context-free matching process and the limited coverage of knowledge bases introduce inaccurate and incomplete annotation noise respectively. Previous studies either considered only incomplete annotation noise or indiscriminately handle two types of noise with the same strategy. In this paper, we argue that the different causes of two types of noise bring up the requirement of different strategies in model architecture. Therefore, we propose the SANTA to handle these two types of noise separately with (1) Memory-smoothed Focal Loss and Entity-aware KNN to relieve the entity ambiguity problem caused by inaccurate annotation, and (2) Boundary Mixup to alleviate decision boundary shifting problem caused by incomplete annotation and a noise-tolerant loss to improve the robustness. Benefiting from our separate tailored strategies, we confirm in the experiment that the two types of noise are well mitigated. SANTA also achieves a new state-of-the-art on five public datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Native Language Identification (NLI) for the Turkish language. NLI is the task of automatically identifying an individual's native language (L1) based on their writing or speech in a non-native language (L2). While most NLI research has focused on L2 English, our study extends this scope to L2 Turkish by analyzing a corpus of texts written by native speakers of Albanian, Arabic and Persian. We leverage a cleaned version of the Turkish Learner Corpus and demonstrate the effectiveness of syntactic features, comparing a structural Part-of-Speech n-gram model to a hybrid model that retains function words. Our models achieve promising results, and we analyze the most predictive features to reveal L1-specific transfer effects. We make our data and code publicly available for further study.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) aims to analyze text or speech via techniques in the computer science field. It serves applications in the domains of healthcare, commerce, education, and so on. Particularly, NLP has been widely applied to the education domain and its applications have enormous potential to help teaching and learning. In this survey, we review recent advances in NLP with a focus on solving problems relevant to the education domain. In detail, we begin with introducing the related background and the real-world scenarios in education to which NLP techniques could contribute. Then, we present a taxonomy of NLP in the education domain and highlight typical NLP applications including question answering, question construction, automated assessment, and error correction. Next, we illustrate the task definition, challenges, and corresponding cutting-edge techniques based on the above taxonomy. In particular, LLM-involved methods are included for discussion due to the wide usage of LLMs in diverse NLP applications. After that, we showcase some off-the-shelf demonstrations in this domain, which are designed for educators or researchers. At last, we conclude with five promising directions for future research, including generalization over subjects and languages, deployed LLM-based systems for education, adaptive learning for teaching and learning, interpretability for education, and ethical consideration of NLP techniques. We organize all relevant datasets and papers in the open-available Github Link for better review https://github.com/LiXinyuan1015/NLP-for-Education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs aim to address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. Assessing the models' suitability for this sensitive application area is of the utmost importance. However, biomedical training has not been systematically evaluated on medical tasks. This study investigates the effect of biomedical training in the context of six practical medical tasks evaluating $25$ models. In contrast to previous evaluations, our results reveal a performance decline in nine out of twelve biomedical models after fine-tuning, particularly on tasks involving hallucinations, ICD10 coding, and instruction adherence. General-domain models like Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct outperformed their biomedical counterparts, indicating a trade-off between domain-specific fine-tuning and general medical task performance. We open-source all evaluation scripts and datasets at https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CLUE to support further research in this critical area.

<title>QUITO-X: A New Perspective on Context Compression from the Information Bottleneck Theory</title>

Abstract: Generative LLM have achieved remarkable success in various industrial applications, owing to their promising In-Context Learning capabilities. However, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier to their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the "lost in the middle" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing redundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is inconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when conditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information bottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that thoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual information in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in different scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In particular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full context in some cases.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to inconsistency, bias, and the absence of transparent decision criteria in automated judging. We present Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3), a cost-aware, adversarial multi-agent framework that orchestrates structured debate among role-specialized agents (advocates, a judge, and an optional jury) to produce reliable and interpretable evaluations. D3 instantiates two complementary protocols: (1) Multi-Advocate One-Round Evaluation (MORE), which elicits k parallel defenses per answer to amplify signal via diverse advocacy, and (2) Single-Advocate Multi-Round Evaluation (SAMRE) with budgeted stopping, which iteratively refines arguments under an explicit token budget and convergence checks. We develop a probabilistic model of score gaps that (i) characterizes reliability and convergence under iterative debate and (ii) explains the separation gains from parallel advocacy. Under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution of the round-r gap concentrates around the true difference and the probability of mis-ranking vanishes; moreover, aggregating across k advocates provably increases expected score separation. We complement theory with a rigorous experimental suite across MT-Bench, AlignBench, and AUTO-J, showing state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments (accuracy and Cohen's kappa), reduced positional and verbosity biases via anonymization and role diversification, and a favorable cost-accuracy frontier enabled by budgeted stopping. Ablations and qualitative analyses isolate the contributions of debate, aggregation, and anonymity. Together, these results establish D3 as a principled, practical recipe for reliable, interpretable, and cost-aware LLM evaluation.

<title>Who Speaks Matters: Analysing the Influence of the Speaker's Ethnicity on Hate Classification</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a lucrative promise for scalable content moderation, including hate speech detection. However, they are also known to be brittle and biased against marginalised communities and dialects. This requires their applications to high-stakes tasks like hate speech detection to be critically scrutinized. In this work, we investigate the robustness of hate speech classification using LLMs particularly when explicit and implicit markers of the speaker's ethnicity are injected into the input. For explicit markers, we inject a phrase that mentions the speaker's linguistic identity. For the implicit markers, we inject dialectal features. By analysing how frequently model outputs flip in the presence of these markers, we reveal varying degrees of brittleness across 3 LLMs and 1 LM and 5 linguistic identities. We find that the presence of implicit dialect markers in inputs causes model outputs to flip more than the presence of explicit markers. Further, the percentage of flips varies across ethnicities. Finally, we find that larger models are more robust. Our findings indicate the need for exercising caution in deploying LLMs for high-stakes tasks like hate speech detection.

<title>A Survey on Automatic Credibility Assessment Using Textual Credibility Signals in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21360</link>

Abstract: In the age of social media and generative AI, the ability to automatically assess the credibility of online content has become increasingly critical, complementing traditional approaches to false information detection. Credibility assessment relies on aggregating diverse credibility signals - small units of information, such as content subjectivity, bias, or a presence of persuasion techniques - into a final credibility label/score. However, current research in automatic credibility assessment and credibility signals detection remains highly fragmented, with many signals studied in isolation and lacking integration. Notably, there is a scarcity of approaches that detect and aggregate multiple credibility signals simultaneously. These challenges are further exacerbated by the absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of research works that connects these research efforts under a common framework and identifies shared trends, challenges, and open problems. In this survey, we address this gap by presenting a systematic and comprehensive literature review of 175 research papers, focusing on textual credibility signals within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which undergoes a rapid transformation due to advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). While positioning the NLP research into the the broader multidisciplinary landscape, we examine both automatic credibility assessment methods as well as the detection of nine categories of credibility signals. We provide an in-depth analysis of three key categories: 1) factuality, subjectivity and bias, 2) persuasion techniques and logical fallacies, and 3) check-worthy and fact-checked claims. In addition to summarising existing methods, datasets, and tools, we outline future research direction and emerging opportunities, with particular attention to evolving challenges posed by generative AI.

<title>SEKE: Specialised Experts for Keyword Extraction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Keyword extraction involves identifying the most descriptive words in a document, allowing automatic categorisation and summarisation of large quantities of diverse textual data. Relying on the insight that real-world keyword detection often requires handling of diverse content, we propose a novel supervised keyword extraction approach based on the mixture of experts (MoE) technique. MoE uses a learnable routing sub-network to direct information to specialised experts, allowing them to specialise in distinct regions of the input space. SEKE, a mixture of Specialised Experts for supervised Keyword Extraction, uses DeBERTa as the backbone model and builds on the MoE framework, where experts attend to each token, by integrating it with a bidirectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, to allow successful extraction even on smaller corpora, where specialisation is harder due to lack of training data. The MoE framework also provides an insight into inner workings of individual experts, enhancing the explainability of the approach. We benchmark SEKE on multiple English datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to strong supervised and unsupervised baselines. Our analysis reveals that depending on data size and type, experts specialise in distinct syntactic and semantic components, such as punctuation, stopwords, parts-of-speech, or named entities.

Abstract: As increasingly capable large language models (LLMs) emerge, researchers have begun exploring their potential for subjective tasks. While recent work demonstrates that LLMs can be aligned with diverse human perspectives, evaluating this alignment on downstream tasks (e.g., hate speech detection) remains challenging due to the use of inconsistent datasets across studies. To address this issue, in this resource paper we propose a two-step framework: we (1) introduce SubData, an open-source Python library designed for standardizing heterogeneous datasets to evaluate LLMs perspective alignment; and (2) present a theory-driven approach leveraging this library to test how differently-aligned LLMs (e.g., aligned with different political viewpoints) classify content targeting specific demographics. SubData's flexible mapping and taxonomy enable customization for diverse research needs, distinguishing it from existing resources. We illustrate its usage with an example application and invite contributions to extend our initial release into a multi-construct benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs perspective alignment on natural language processing tasks.

<title>Rethinking the Residual Distribution of Locate-then-Editing Methods in Model Editing</title>

Abstract: Model editing enables targeted updates to the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) with minimal retraining. Among existing approaches, locate-then-edit methods constitute a prominent paradigm: they first identify critical layers, then compute residuals at the final critical layer based on the target edit, and finally apply least-squares-based multi-layer updates via $\textbf{residual distribution}$. While empirically effective, we identify a counterintuitive failure mode: residual distribution, a core mechanism in these methods, introduces weight shift errors that undermine editing precision. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that such errors increase with the distribution distance, batch size, and edit sequence length, ultimately leading to inaccurate or suboptimal edits. To address this, we propose the $\textbf{B}$oundary $\textbf{L}$ayer $\textbf{U}$pdat$\textbf{E (BLUE)}$ strategy to enhance locate-then-edit methods. Sequential batch editing experiments on three LLMs and two datasets demonstrate that BLUE not only delivers an average performance improvement of 35.59\%, significantly advancing the state of the art in model editing, but also enhances the preservation of LLMs' general capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/xpq-tech/BLUE.

Abstract: The GPT-4 technical report suggests that downstream performance can be predicted from pre-training signals, but offers little methodological detail on how to quantify this. This work address this gap by modeling knowledge retention, the capacity of a pre-trained language model to memorize factual information from its corpus, and introduce a principled method to estimate it prior to training. We propose Size-dependent Mutual Information (SMI), an information-theoretic predictor that integrates knowledge frequency, knowledge specificity, and model size to forecast closed-book question answering (QA) accuracy. SMI is validated through large-scale document retrieval over the disclosed pre-training corpora of 21 public and 3 custom models, combined with a robust multi-template QA evaluation. Experiments show that SMI significantly outperforms repetition-based baselines and achieves $R^2$ > 0.7 in predicting QA accuracy for models above 1B parameters, without additional training. The analysis further reveals diminishing returns from scaling data and model size and provides evidence for an intrinsic upper bound on knowledge retention achievable by pre-training alone, motivating retrieval and other augmentation strategies.

Abstract: The advancement of LLMs and their accessibility have triggered renewed interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning as robust and adaptive frameworks for dynamically changing environments. This paper introduces RL-Focal, a two-stage RL agent framework that routes and ensembles LLMs. First, we develop the Decider RL-agent, which learns to dynamically select an ensemble of small size ($m_i$) among $N$ LLMs ($m_i \ll N$) for incoming queries from a user-defined downstream task $i$, by maximizing both error-diversity and reasoning-performance of the selected ensemble through iterative updates of task-adaptive rewards and policy. Second, to enable effective fusion of dynamically selected LLMs, we develop the stage-2 Fusion RL-agent, which learns to resolve reasoning conflicts from different LLMs and dynamically adapts to different ensemble teams composed by the Decider Agent for different downstream tasks. Third, we introduce the focal diversity metric to better model the error correlations among multiple LLMs, further improving the generalization performance of the Decider Agent, which actively prunes the ensemble combinations. By focal diversity, we enhance performance across tasks by effectively promoting reward-aware and policy-adaptive ensemble selection and inference fusion. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that RL-Focal achieves the performance improvement of 8.48\% with an ensemble of small size compared to the best individual LLM in a pool and offers stronger robustness.

Abstract: High-quality instruction-tuning data is crucial for developing Large Language Models (LLMs) that can effectively navigate real-world tasks and follow human instructions. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable approach for creating such datasets, it imposes a quality ceiling where models trained on the data cannot outperform the LLM generating it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Reference-Level Feedback, a paradigm that extracts desirable characteristics from carefully curated reference samples to guide the synthesis of higher-quality instruction-response pairs. Using this approach, we synthesize REFED, a dataset of 10K instruction-response pairs. Fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct on REFED demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among similarly sized models, notably reaching a 43.96\% length-controlled win-rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Reference-Level Feedback consistently outperforms traditional sample-level feedback methods, generalizes across model architectures, and produces high-quality and diverse data at low cost.

<title>Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Synergistic Training-Inference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.

Abstract: This paper makes three contributions. First, via a substantial corpus of 1,419,047 comments posted on 3,161 YouTube news videos of major US cable news outlets, we analyze how users engage with LGBTQ+ news content. Our analyses focus both on positive and negative content. In particular, we construct a fine-grained hope speech classifier that detects positive (hope speech), negative, neutral, and irrelevant content. Second, in consultation with a public health expert specializing on LGBTQ+ health, we conduct an annotation study with a balanced and diverse political representation and release a dataset of 3,750 instances with fine-grained labels and detailed annotator demographic information. Finally, beyond providing a vital resource for the LGBTQ+ community, our annotation study and subsequent in-the-wild assessments reveal (1) strong association between rater political beliefs and how they rate content relevant to a marginalized community; (2) models trained on individual political beliefs exhibit considerable in-the-wild disagreement; and (3) zero-shot large language models (LLMs) align more with liberal raters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are integral to applications such as conversational agents and content creation, where precise control over a model's personality is essential for maintaining tone, consistency, and user engagement. However, prevailing prompt-based or fine-tuning approaches either lack robustness or demand large-scale training data, making them costly and impractical. In this paper, we present PALETTE (Personality Adjustment by LLM SElf-TargeTed quEries), a novel method for personality editing in LLMs. Our approach introduces adjustment queries, where self-referential statements grounded in psychological constructs are treated analogously to factual knowledge, enabling direct editing of personality-related responses. Unlike fine-tuning, PALETTE requires only 12 editing samples to achieve substantial improvements in personality alignment across personality dimensions. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a long, expensive, and complex process, relying heavily on human medicinal chemists, who can spend years searching the vast space of potential therapies. Recent advances in artificial intelligence for chemistry have sought to expedite individual drug discovery tasks; however, there remains a critical need for an intelligent agent that can navigate the drug discovery process. Towards this end, we introduce LIDDIA, an autonomous agent capable of intelligently navigating the drug discovery process in silico. By leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models, LIDDIA serves as a low-cost and highly-adaptable tool for autonomous drug discovery. We comprehensively examine LIDDIA , demonstrating that (1) it can generate molecules meeting key pharmaceutical criteria on over 70% of 30 clinically relevant targets, (2) it intelligently balances exploration and exploitation in the chemical space, and (3) it identifies one promising novel candidate on AR/NR3C4, a critical target for both prostate and breast cancers.

Abstract: The escalating scale and cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) training necessitate accurate pre-training prediction of downstream task performance for efficient resource allocation. This is challenged by: 1) the emergence phenomenon, where metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, hindering prediction by smaller models; and 2) uneven task difficulty and inconsistent performance scaling patterns, leading to high metric variability. Current prediction methods lack accuracy and reliability. We propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) framework for downstream performance prediction. The COD framework clusters tasks by their difficulty scaling features, thereby establishing a more stable and predictable support subset through the exclusion of tasks exhibiting non-emergent behavior or irregular scaling. We adopt a performance scaling law to predict cluster-wise performance with theoretical support. Predictable subset performance acts as an intermediate predictor for the full evaluation set. We further derive a mapping function to accurately extrapolate the performance of the subset to the full set. Applied to an LLM with 70B parameters, COD achieved a 1.36% average prediction error across eight key LLM benchmarks, offering actionable insights for resource allocation and training monitoring of LLMs pretraining.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that making a model spend more time thinking through longer Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) enables it to gain significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks. While current researches continue to explore the benefits of increasing test-time compute by extending the CoT lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs), we are concerned about a potential issue hidden behind the current pursuit of test-time scaling: Would excessively scaling the CoT length actually bring adverse effects to a model's reasoning performance? Our explorations on mathematical reasoning tasks reveal an unexpected finding that scaling with longer CoTs can indeed impair the reasoning performance of LLMs in certain domains. Moreover, we discover that there exists an optimal scaled length distribution that differs across different domains. Based on these insights, we propose a Thinking-Optimal Scaling strategy. Our method first uses a small set of seed data with varying response length distributions to teach the model to adopt different reasoning efforts for deep thinking. Then, the model selects its shortest correct response under different reasoning efforts on additional problems for self-improvement. Our self-improved models built upon Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct outperform other distillation-based 32B o1-like models across various math benchmarks, and achieve performance on par with the teacher model QwQ-32B-Preview that produces the seed data.

Abstract: Evaluating the pedagogical capabilities of AI-based tutoring models is critical for making guided progress in the field. Yet, we lack a reliable, easy-to-use, and simple-to-run evaluation that reflects the pedagogical abilities of models. To fill this gap, we present MathTutorBench, an open-source benchmark for holistic tutoring model evaluation. MathTutorBench contains a collection of datasets and metrics that broadly cover tutor abilities as defined by learning sciences research in dialog-based teaching. To score the pedagogical quality of open-ended teacher responses, we train a reward model and show it can discriminate expert from novice teacher responses with high accuracy. We evaluate a wide set of closed- and open-weight models on MathTutorBench and find that subject expertise, indicated by solving ability, does not immediately translate to good teaching. Rather, pedagogy and subject expertise appear to form a trade-off that is navigated by the degree of tutoring specialization of the model. Furthermore, tutoring appears to become more challenging in longer dialogs, where simpler questioning strategies begin to fail. We release the benchmark, code, and leaderboard openly to enable rapid benchmarking of future models.

<title>Exploring the Generalizability of Factual Hallucination Mitigation via Enhancing Precise Knowledge Utilization</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to align their responses with objective facts, resulting in the issue of factual hallucinations, which can be difficult to detect and mislead users without relevant knowledge. Although post-training techniques have been employed to mitigate the issue, existing methods usually suffer from poor generalization and trade-offs in other different capabilities. In this paper, we propose to address these by directly augmenting LLM's fundamental ability to precisely leverage its knowledge and introduce PKUE (Precise Knowledge Utilization Enhancement), which fine-tunes the model on self-generated responses to precise and simple factual questions through preference optimization. Furthermore, we construct FactualBench, a comprehensive and precise factual QA dataset containing 181k Chinese data spanning 21 domains, to facilitate both evaluation and training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PKUE significantly improves LLM overall performance, with consistent enhancement across factual tasks of various forms, general tasks beyond factuality, and tasks in different language.

<title>Disentangling Feature Structure: A Mathematically Provable Two-Stage Training Dynamics in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers may exhibit two-stage training dynamics during the real-world training process. For instance, when training GPT-2 on the Counterfact dataset, the answers progress from syntactically incorrect to syntactically correct to semantically correct. However, existing theoretical analyses hardly account for this feature-level two-stage phenomenon, which originates from the disentangled two-type features like syntax and semantics. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate how the two-stage training dynamics potentially occur in transformers. Specifically, we analyze the feature learning dynamics induced by the aforementioned disentangled two-type feature structure, grounding our analysis in a simplified yet illustrative setting that comprises a normalized ReLU self-attention layer and structured data. Such disentanglement of feature structure is general in practice, e.g., natural languages contain syntax and semantics, and proteins contain primary and secondary structures. To our best knowledge, this is the first rigorous result regarding a feature-level two-stage optimization process in transformers. Additionally, a corollary indicates that such a two-stage process is closely related to the spectral properties of the attention weights, which accords well with our empirical findings.

<title>Test-Time Alignment for Large Language Models via Textual Model Predictive Control</title>

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences through finetuning is resource-intensive, motivating lightweight alternatives at test time. We address test-time alignment through the lens of sequential decision making, a perspective that reveals two fundamental challenges. When actions are defined at the token level, as in guided decoding, alignment suffers from the curse of horizon. Conversely, when actions are at the response level, as in traditional iterative refinement, the curse of dimensionality emerges. To resolve this trade-off, we draw inspiration from Model Predictive Control (MPC) in control theory to propose Textual Model Predictive Control (TMPC), a novel predictive planning framework adapted for aligning LLMs at inference time. A key limitation of standard MPC is its reliance on predefined, hard segment boundaries, which are often absent in text generation. TMPC overcomes this by introducing two principles inspired by hierarchical reinforcement learning: (1) Hindsight Subgoal Identification, where TMPC analyzes generation subgoals to retrospectively identify high-reward intermediate outputs as subgoals. This allows the framework to discover meaningful, task-specific planning steps (e.g., a sentence in machine translation or a bug fix in code generation.). (2) Subgoal-Conditioned Re-Generation, where these identified subgoals are used to guide subsequent planning iterations. By conditioning on these proven, high-quality subgoals, TMPC ensures stable improvement by building upon previously validated successes. TMPC is evaluated on three tasks with distinct segmentation properties: discourse-level translation, long-form response generation, and program synthesis. The results demonstrate that TMPC consistently improves performance, highlighting the generality.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for the authorship attribution task that leverages the various linguistic representations learned at different layers of pre-trained transformer-based models. We evaluate our approach on three datasets, comparing it to a state-of-the-art baseline in in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. We found that utilizing various transformer layers improves the robustness of authorship attribution models when tested on out-of-domain data, resulting in new state-of-the-art results. Our analysis gives further insights into how our model's different layers get specialized in representing certain stylistic features that benefit the model when tested out of the domain.

<title>Why Is Spatial Reasoning Hard for VLMs? An Attention Mechanism Perspective on Focus Areas</title>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost. We make code and data publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/shiqichen17/AdaptVis.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality and diverse training samples from extensive datasets plays a crucial role in reducing training overhead and enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies fall short in assessing the overall value of selected data, focusing primarily on individual quality, and struggle to strike an effective balance between ensuring diversity and minimizing data point traversals. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel choice-based sample selection framework that shifts the focus from evaluating individual sample quality to comparing the contribution value of different samples when incorporated into the subset. Thanks to the advanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, we utilize LLMs to evaluate the value of each option during the selection process. Furthermore, we design a greedy sampling process where samples are incrementally added to the subset, thereby improving efficiency by eliminating the need for exhaustive traversal of the entire dataset with the limited budget. Extensive experiments demonstrate that selected data from our method not only surpasses the performance of the full dataset but also achieves competitive results with recent powerful studies, while requiring fewer selections. Moreover, we validate our approach on a larger medical dataset, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world applications. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/BIRlz/comperative_sample_selection.

Abstract: Long-context modeling has drawn more and more attention in the area of Large Language Models (LLMs). Continual training with long-context data becomes the de-facto method to equip LLMs with the ability to process long inputs. However, it still remains an open challenge to measure the quality of long-context training data. To address this issue, we propose a Long-context data selection framework with Attention-based Dependency Measurement (LADM), which can efficiently identify high-quality long-context data from a large-scale, multi-domain pre-training corpus. LADM leverages the retrieval capabilities of the attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive quality measurement of long-context data. Experimental results show that our LADM framework significantly boosts the performance of LLMs on multiple long-context tasks with only 1B tokens for continual training.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) driven by Transformer architectures has advanced significantly, yet faces challenges with low-resource language pairs like Vietnamese-Japanese (Vi-Ja). Issues include sparse parallel data and handling linguistic/cultural nuances. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning, often refined via Reinforcement Learning (RL), enables high-quality synthetic data generation. We introduce VNJPTranslate, a pipeline designed to systematically address the Vi-Ja translation task. It features a targeted data augmentation strategy using advanced LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompting for challenging segments identified via corpus analysis. Subsequently, we employ efficient fine-tuning techniques (Unsloth with QLoRA) on a capable, low-parameter autoregressive model (specifically, a fine-tuned version of the 1.8B parameter Sailor model, which is based on the Qwen architecture) to create a practical and high-performing translation system. This integrated approach aims to improve Vi-Ja translation quality significantly over existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In different alignment scenarios, such as safety, confidence, and general preference alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but play a central role in transferring human preferences. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and reference answers as a supplementary reward function for alignment. When unary reference answers are available, such similarity-based rewards can circumvent the need for binary preference data and explicit reward modeling. We introduce \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm that does not rely on reward or reference models. RefAlign utilizes language generation evaluation metrics, such as BERTScore, between sampled generations and reference answers as surrogate rewards. Beyond general preference optimization, RefAlign can be naturally extended to diverse scenarios, including safety and confidence alignment, by combining similarity-based rewards with task-specific objectives. Across multiple scenarios, RefAlign achieves performance comparable to prior alignment methods while operating without binary preference data or reward models. The code is available at https://github.com/mzhaoshuai/RefAlign.

Abstract: Clinical case reports encode temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.

Abstract: Humans understand new combinations of words encountered if they are combinations of words recognized from different contexts, an ability called Compositional Generalization. The COGS benchmark (Kim and Linzen, 2020) arXiv:2010.05465 reports 0% accuracy for Transformer models on some structural generalizations. We use (Weiss et al., 2021) arXiv:2106.06981's Restricted Access Sequence Processing (RASP), a Transformer-equivalent programming language, to demonstrate that a Transformer Encoder-Decoder can perform COGS and the semantically equivalent ReCOGS_pos (Wu et al., 2024) arXiv:2303.13716 systematically and compositionally: Our RASP models attain near perfect scores on structural generalization splits on COGS (exact match) and ReCOGS_pos (semantic exact match). Our RASP models show the (Re)COGS tasks do not require a hierarchical or tree-structured solution (contrary to (Kim and Linzen, 2020) arXiv:2010.05465, (Yao and Koller, 2022) arXiv:2210.13050, (Murty et al., 2022) arXiv:2305.18741, (Liu et al., 2021) arXiv:2107.06516): we use word-level tokens with an "embedding" layer that tags with possible part of speech, applying just once per encoder pass 19 attention-head compatible flat pattern-matching rules (easily identified with specific training examples), shown using grammar coverage (Zeller et al., 2023) to cover the non-recursive aspects of the input grammar, plus masking out prepositional phrases ("pp noun") and/or sentential complements (cp) when recognizing grammar patterns and extracting nouns related to the main verb in the sentence, and output the next logical form (LF) token (repeating until the LF is complete). The models do not apply recursive, tree-structured rules like "np_det pp np -> np_pp -> np", but score near perfect semantic and string exact match on both COGS and ReCOGS pp recursion, cp recursion using the decoder loop.

Abstract: Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in machine translation. However, their performance in multi-domain translation (MDT) is less satisfactory, the meanings of words can vary across different domains, highlighting the significant ambiguity inherent in MDT. Therefore, evaluating the disambiguation ability of LLMs in MDT, remains an open problem. To this end, we present an evaluation and analysis of LLMs on disambiguation in multi-domain translation (DMDTEval), our systematic evaluation framework consisting of three critical aspects: (1) we construct a translation test set with multi-domain ambiguous word annotation, (2) we curate a diverse set of disambiguation prompt strategies, and (3) we design precise disambiguation metrics, and study the efficacy of various prompt strategies on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across 4 language pairs and 13 domains, our extensive experiments reveal a number of crucial findings that we believe will pave the way and also facilitate further research in the critical area of improving the disambiguation of LLMs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate impressive long-horizon reasoning capabilities. However, their reliance on static internal knowledge limits their performance on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks and hinders their ability to produce comprehensive research reports requiring synthesis of diverse web information. To address this, we propose WebThinker, a deep research agent that empowers LRMs to autonomously search the web, navigate among web pages, and draft reports during the reasoning process. WebThinker integrates a Deep Web Explorer module, enabling LRMs to dynamically search, navigate, and extract information from the web when encountering knowledge gaps. It also employs an Autonomous Think-Search-and-Draft strategy, allowing the model to seamlessly interleave reasoning, information gathering, and report writing in real time. To further enhance research tool utilization, we introduce an RL-based training strategy via iterative online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks (GPQA, GAIA, WebWalkerQA, HLE) and scientific report generation tasks (Glaive) demonstrate that WebThinker significantly outperforms existing methods and strong proprietary systems. Our approach enhances LRM reliability and applicability in complex scenarios, paving the way for more capable and versatile deep research systems.

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics for literature prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation as being superior to human translation from experienced professionals. In the long run, this bias could result in an irreversible decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce LITRANSPROQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering framework designed for literary translation evaluation. LITRANSPROQA integrates humans in the loop to incorporate insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, LITRANSPROQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation and surpassing the best state-of-the-art metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, LITRANSPROQA reaches an adequacy performance comparable to trained linguistic student evaluators, though it still falls behind experienced professional translators. LITRANSPROQA shows broad applicability to open-source models like LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free tool for evaluating literary translations that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) has demonstrated broad application potential, yet their safety and reliability remain critical concerns that require systematic exploration. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic safety evaluation of 11 MLRMs across 5 benchmarks and unveil prevalent safety degradation phenomena in most advanced models. Moreover, our analysis reveals distinct safety patterns across different benchmarks: significant safety degradation is observed across jailbreak robustness benchmarks, whereas safety-awareness benchmarks demonstrate less pronounced degradation. In particular, the long thought process in some scenarios even enhances safety performance. Therefore, it is a potential approach to address safety issues in MLRMs by leveraging the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of the model to detect unsafe intent. To operationalize this insight, we construct a multimodal tuning dataset that incorporates a safety-oriented thought process. Experimental results from fine-tuning existing MLRMs with this dataset effectively enhances the safety on both jailbreak robustness and safety-awareness benchmarks. This study provides a new perspective for developing safe MLRMs. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/xinyuelou/Think-in-Safety.

Abstract: Conversational query reformulation (CQR) has become indispensable for improving retrieval in dialogue-based applications. However, existing approaches typically rely on reference passages for optimization, which are impractical to acquire in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel reference-free preference optimization framework DualReform that generates pseudo reference passages from commonly-encountered conversational datasets containing only queries and responses. DualReform attains this goal through two key innovations: (1) response-based inference, where responses serve as proxies to infer pseudo reference passages, and (2) response refinement via the dual-role of CQR, where a CQR model refines responses based on the shared objectives between response refinement and CQR. Despite not relying on reference passages, DualReform achieves 96.9--99.1% of the retrieval accuracy attainable only with reference passages and surpasses the state-of-the-art method by up to 31.6%.

Abstract: The progress of AI is bottlenecked by the quality of evaluation, making powerful LLM-as-a-Judge models a core solution. The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.

Abstract: Despite advances in pretraining with extended context lengths, large language models (LLMs) still face challenges in effectively utilizing real-world long-context information, primarily due to insufficient long-context alignment caused by data quality issues, training inefficiencies, and the lack of well-designed optimization objectives. To address these limitations, we propose a framework named $\textbf{S}$h$\textbf{o}$rt-to-$\textbf{Lo}$ng $\textbf{P}$reference $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{SoLoPO}$), decoupling long-context preference optimization (PO) into two components: short-context PO and short-to-long reward alignment (SoLo-RA), supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence. Specifically, short-context PO leverages preference pairs sampled from short contexts to enhance the model's contextual knowledge utilization ability. Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data construction and training processes. Experimental results show that SoLoPO enhances all these algorithms with respect to stronger length and domain generalization abilities across various long-context benchmarks, while achieving notable improvements in both computational and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning, (2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency. Our codes and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/LowRankClone and https://huggingface.co/collections/JitaiHao/low-rank-clone-lrc-6828389e96a93f1d4219dfaf.

<title>Transparent and Robust RAG: Adaptive-Reward Reinforcement Learning for Decision Traceability</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) delivers substantial value in knowledge-intensive applications. Many recent works use reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit strong reasoning in RAG generators. However, two key challenges remain unresolved: (1) Transparency: most prior methods do not explicitly indicate which references are actually used during the reasoning that leads to the final answer, limiting interpretability and visibility; (2) Stability: the KL divergence estimator used in existing RL-based approaches may cause gradient spikes, leading to unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent (ARENA), a transparent and robust RAG generator framework trained via RL with designed rewards. Based on our structured protocol, KL divergence stabilization, and adaptive reward calculation modules, ARENA enables the RAG generator to identify key evidence, perform structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces. Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, extensive experiments across multiple baselines show 10-30% accuracy improvements on three multi-hop QA datasets, comparable to advanced closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1). Further analyses show that ARENA generalizes well to unseen datasets and tasks. Our models and codes are publicly released.

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even without adversarial prompts.

Abstract: Recently released LLMs have strong multilingual \& multimodal capabilities. Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also present an extension to a current jailbreak-template-based strategy and propose a novel template, showing higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 96\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training) remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks (Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation capabilities, including tasks like summarization, often producing coherent and fluent outputs. However, faithfulness to source material remains a significant challenge due to the generation of hallucinations. While extensive research focuses on detecting and reducing these inaccuracies, less attention has been paid to the positional distribution of hallucination within generated text, particularly in long outputs. In this work, we investigate where hallucinations occur in LLM-based long response generation, using long document summarization as a key case study. Focusing on the challenging setting of long context-aware long response generation, we find a consistent and concerning phenomenon: hallucinations tend to concentrate disproportionately in the latter parts of the generated long response. To understand this bias, we explore potential contributing factors related to the dynamics of attention and decoding over long sequences. Furthermore, we investigate methods to mitigate this positional hallucination, aiming to improve faithfulness specifically in the concluding segments of long outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's instructional planning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for enhancing model reasoning. However, existing RL methods like GRPO often rely on unstructured self-sampling to fit scalar rewards, often producing inefficient rollouts that fail to capture transferable problem-solving strategies. To address these limitations, we propose **TemplateRL**, a structured template-guided RL framework that augments policy optimization with explicit template guidance. Our approach first constructs a problem-solving template library via MCTS on a small seed set, then seamlessly integrates this high-level structured guidance into RL training. By guiding rollout generation to align with proven template structures, TemplateRL significantly improves high-quality trajectory hit rates while reducing ineffective exploration. This structure-guided design steers the policy toward validated strategic patterns, stabilizing training dynamics, and enhancing RL sampling efficiency. Notably, the explicit template library is interpretable, editable, and supports online updates-enabling continuous updates during both training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemplateRL outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME and 41% on AMC, with superior stability on weak models and remarkable cross-domain generalization, highlighting its potential for broader tasks.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1) lightweight finetuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models, and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate semi-supervised approaches that combine limited annotated data with self-supervised learning from users' publications. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 with contextual prompting by 21.4% in F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient, low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions (rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at: https://github.com/flobk/TRIM

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fundamental task in natural language processing, offering fine-grained insights into opinions expressed in text. While existing research has largely focused on resource-rich languages like English which leveraging large annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and language-specific tools. These resources are often unavailable for low-resource languages such as Bengali. The ABSA task in Bengali remains poorly explored and is further complicated by its unique linguistic characteristics and a lack of annotated data, pre-trained models, and optimized hyperparameters. To address these challenges, this research propose CrosGrpsABS, a novel hybrid framework that leverages bidirectional cross-attention between syntactic and semantic graphs to enhance aspect-level sentiment classification. The CrosGrpsABS combines transformerbased contextual embeddings with graph convolutional networks, built upon rule-based syntactic dependency parsing and semantic similarity computations. By employing bidirectional crossattention, the model effectively fuses local syntactic structure with global semantic context, resulting in improved sentiment classification performance across both low- and high-resource settings. We evaluate CrosGrpsABS on four low-resource Bengali ABSA datasets and the high-resource English SemEval 2014 Task 4 dataset. The CrosGrpsABS consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving notable improvements, including a 0.93% F1-score increase for the Restaurant domain and a 1.06% gain for the Laptop domain in the SemEval 2014 Task 4 benchmark.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on scaling model parameters. However, as hardware limits constrain further model growth, the primary computational bottleneck has shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long sequences by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position data-centric compression as the emerging paradigm, which improves AI efficiency by directly compressing the volume of data processed during model training or inference. To formalize this shift, we establish a unified framework for existing efficiency strategies and demonstrate why it constitutes a crucial paradigm change for long-context AI. We then systematically review the landscape of data-centric compression methods, analyzing their benefits across diverse scenarios. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising future research directions. Our work aims to provide a novel perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing efforts, and catalyze innovation to address the challenges posed by ever-increasing context lengths.

Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, each responsible for a distinct stage of the RAG pipeline. By decomposing tasks into subtasks such as query disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and enabling agents to communicate intermediate reasoning via chain-of-thought prompting, MA-RAG progressively refines retrieval and synthesis while maintaining modular interpretability. Extensive experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA benchmarks, including NQ, HotpotQA, 2WikimQA, and TriviaQA, demonstrate that MA-RAG significantly outperforms standalone LLMs and existing RAG methods across all model scales. Notably, even a small LLaMA3-8B model equipped with MA-RAG surpasses larger standalone LLMs, while larger variants (LLaMA3-70B and GPT-4o-mini) set new state-of-the-art results on challenging multi-hop datasets. Ablation studies reveal that both the planner and extractor agents are critical for multi-hop reasoning, and that high-capacity models are especially important for the QA agent to synthesize answers effectively. Beyond general-domain QA, MA-RAG generalizes to specialized domains such as medical QA, achieving competitive performance against domain-specific models without any domain-specific fine-tuning. Our results highlight the effectiveness of collaborative, modular reasoning in retrieval-augmented systems: MA-RAG not only improves answer accuracy and robustness but also provides interpretable intermediate reasoning steps, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and reliable multi-agent RAG.

Abstract: While large reasoning models demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks, they lack the ability to adjust reasoning token usage based on task difficulty. This often leads to the "overthinking" problem -- excessive and unnecessary reasoning -- which, although potentially mitigated by human intervention to control the token budget, still fundamentally contradicts the goal of achieving fully autonomous AI. In this work, we propose Adaptive Reasoning Model (ARM), a reasoning model capable of adaptively selecting appropriate reasoning formats based on the task at hand. These formats include three efficient ones -- Direct Answer, Short CoT, and Code -- as well as a more elaborate format, Long CoT. To train ARM, we introduce Ada-GRPO, an adaptation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which addresses the format collapse issue in traditional GRPO. Ada-GRPO enables ARM to achieve high token efficiency, reducing tokens by an average of 30%, and up to 70%, while maintaining performance comparable to the model that relies solely on Long CoT. Furthermore, not only does it improve inference efficiency through reduced token generation, but it also brings a 2x speedup in training. In addition to the default Adaptive Mode, ARM supports two additional reasoning modes: 1) Instruction-Guided Mode, which allows users to explicitly specify the reasoning format via special tokens -- ideal when the appropriate format is known for a batch of tasks. 2) Consensus-Guided Mode, which aggregates the outputs of the three efficient formats and resorts to Long CoT in case of disagreement, prioritizing performance with higher token usage.

Abstract: We present Multi-Scale Manifold Alignment(MSMA), an information-geometric framework that decomposes LLM representations into local, intermediate, and global manifolds and learns cross-scale mappings that preserve geometry and information. Across GPT-2, BERT, RoBERTa, and T5, we observe consistent hierarchical patterns and find that MSMA improves alignment metrics under multiple estimators (e.g., relative KL reduction and MI gains with statistical significance across seeds). Controlled interventions at different scales yield distinct and architecture-dependent effects on lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence. While our theoretical analysis relies on idealized assumptions, the empirical results suggest that multi-objective alignment offers a practical lens for analyzing cross-scale information flow and guiding representation-level control.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Dynamical Manifold Evolution Theory (DMET), a conceptual framework that models large language model (LLM) generation as a continuous trajectory evolving on a low-dimensional semantic manifold. The theory characterizes latent dynamics through three interpretable metrics-state continuity ($C$), attractor compactness ($Q$), and topological persistence ($P$)-which jointly capture the smoothness, stability, and structure of representation evolution. Empirical analyses across multiple Transformer architectures reveal consistent links between these latent dynamics and text quality: smoother trajectories correspond to greater fluency, and richer topological organization correlates with enhanced coherence. Different models exhibit distinct dynamical regimes, reflecting diverse strategies of semantic organization in latent space. Moreover, decoding parameters such as temperature and top-$p$ shape these trajectories in predictable ways, defining a balanced region that harmonizes fluency and creativity. As a phenomenological rather than first-principles framework, DMET provides a unified and testable perspective for interpreting, monitoring, and guiding LLM behavior, offering new insights into the interplay between internal representation dynamics and external text generation quality.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process. In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600 distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions, and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics, logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured reasoning within latent embedding spaces.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering (MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically, on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

<title>Safety-Aligned Weights Are Not Enough: Refusal-Teacher-Guided Finetuning Enhances Safety and Downstream Performance under Harmful Finetuning Attacks</title>

Abstract: Recently, major AI providers such as Google and OpenAI have introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service (FaaS), which allows users to customize Large Language Models (LLMs) using their own data. However, this service is vulnerable to safety degradation when user data includes harmful prompts, a threat known as harmful finetuning attacks. Prior works attempt to mitigate this issue by first constructing safety-aligned model and then finetuning the model on user data. However, we observe that the safety-aligned weights provide weak initialization for downstream task learning, leading to suboptimal safety-alignment and downstream task performance. To address this, we propose a Refusal-Teacher (Ref-Teacher)-guided finetuning framework. Instead of finetuning a safety-aligned model on user data, our approach directly finetunes the base model under the guidance of a safety-aligned Ref-Teacher, which filters harmful prompts from user data and distills safety-alignment knowledge into the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ref-Teacher-guided finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in FaaS.

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300 annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that instance-specific issues output by LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge match those annotated by humans in 2/3 cases, and that LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports composed by human annotators. We also demonstrate in a case study how the use of LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge can substantially improve NLG systems performance. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS), yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness classification, grounded in linguistics, communication and argumentation concepts. Our framework defines six core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1 respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

Abstract: Real-world financial analysis involves information across multiple languages and modalities, from reports and news to scanned filings and meeting recordings. Yet most existing evaluations of LLMs in finance remain text-only, monolingual, and largely saturated by current models. To bridge these gaps, we present MultiFinBen, the first expert-annotated multilingual (five languages) and multimodal (text, vision, audio) benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic financial contexts. MultiFinBen introduces two new task families: multilingual financial reasoning, which tests cross-lingual evidence integration from filings and news, and financial OCR, which extracts structured text from scanned documents containing tables and charts. Rather than aggregating all available datasets, we apply a structured, difficulty-aware selection based on advanced model performance, ensuring balanced challenge and removing redundant tasks. Evaluating 21 leading LLMs shows that even frontier multimodal models like GPT-4o achieve only 46.01% overall, stronger on vision and audio but dropping sharply in multilingual settings. These findings expose persistent limitations in multilingual, multimodal, and expert-level financial reasoning. All datasets, evaluation scripts, and leaderboards are publicly released.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) is an essential emergent ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), and recent studies introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to exemplars of ICL to enhance the reasoning capability, especially in mathematics tasks. However, given the continuous advancement of model capabilities, it remains unclear whether CoT exemplars still benefit recent, stronger models in such tasks. Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations. We further investigate the effectiveness of enhanced CoT exemplars, constructed using answers from advanced models such as \texttt{Qwen2.5-Max} and \texttt{DeepSeek-R1}. Experimental results indicate that these enhanced exemplars still fail to improve the model's reasoning performance. Further analysis reveals that models tend to ignore the exemplars and focus primarily on the instructions, leading to no observable gain in reasoning ability. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of the current ICL+CoT framework in mathematical reasoning, calling for a re-examination of the ICL paradigm and the definition of exemplars.

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks. Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings. In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via multi-hop hate speech explanation using the Moral Foundations Theory. MFTCXplain comprises 3,000 tweets across Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Our results show a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35). Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented languages. Our findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to internalize and reflect human moral reasoning

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research. However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2) learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most methods still rely on direct IPA-based phonetic matching or employ LLMs without phonological guidance. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that performs IPA-based phonological adaptation and syllable-aware alignment to retrieve L1 keyword sequence and uses LLMs to generate verbal cues. We evaluate PhoniTale through automated metrics and a short-term recall test with human participants, comparing its output to human-written and prior automated mnemonics. Our findings show that PhoniTale consistently outperforms previous automated approaches and achieves quality comparable to human-written mnemonics.

Abstract: Adapter parameters provide a mechanism to modify the behavior of machine learning models and have gained significant popularity in the context of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These parameters can be merged to support multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work on merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been limited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In this paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based compositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a long text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks concurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark comprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an efficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications, where computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions that are both resource-efficient and high-performing. Our contributions lay the groundwork for advancing the capabilities of LLMs in real-world multi-tasking scenarios, expanding their applicability to complex, resource-constrained use cases.

Abstract: Existing informal language-based (e.g., human language) Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face a significant challenge: their verification processes, which provide crucial training signals, are neither reliable nor scalable. In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) incur quadratic attention complexity with input length, creating a major time bottleneck in the prefilling stage. Existing acceleration methods largely exploit attention score sparsity by estimating blocks with high attention scores and applying dynamic sparse attention. In this work, we identify another untapped form of sparsity in the prefilling stage, namely decoding-time contribution sparsity, where many attention blocks exhibit nontrivial attention scores during prefilling yet contribute negligibly to subsequent decoding, as indicated by gradient-based analysis. Building on this observation, we propose TriangleMix, a training-free static attention pattern that uses dense attention in a subset of layers and switches to Triangle attention in the others. Extensive experiments show that TriangleMix preserves nearly lossless performance relative to dense attention while substantially reducing attention overhead in Triangle layers. For 128K inputs, Triangle attention achieves a 15.3x speedup in attention computation, significantly exceeding the acceleration of typical dynamic sparse methods (1.9x to 3.4x). Furthermore, TriangleMix can be seamlessly combined with dynamic sparsity approaches, delivering an additional 6% to 19% reduction in TTFT over using dynamic sparsity alone.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose radiology Retrieval and Reasoning (RaR), a multi-step retrieval and reasoning framework designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, factual consistency, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology question answering. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. To assess generalizability, we additionally tested on an unseen internal dataset of 65 real-world radiology board examination questions. RaR significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting and conventional online RAG. The greatest gains occurred in small-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, RaR retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models showed gains from RaR (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating that retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of RaR to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. All datasets, code, and the full RaR framework are publicly available to support open research and clinical translation.

Abstract: We present an approach to modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP tasks through both architectural and data-centric innovations. Our model, DEM-MoE (Demographic-Aware Mixture of Experts), routes inputs to expert subnetworks based on annotator demographics, enabling it to better represent structured, group-level variation compared to prior models. DEM-MoE consistently performs competitively across demographic groups, and shows especially strong results on datasets with high annotator disagreement. To address sparse demographic coverage, we test whether LLM-generated synthetic annotations via zero-shot persona prompting can be used for data imputation. We show these synthetic judgments align moderately well with human annotations on our data and offer a scalable way to potentially enrich training data. We then propose and evaluate approaches for blending real and synthetic data using strategies tailored to dataset structure. We find that the optimal strategies depend on dataset structure. Together, these contributions improve the representation of diverse perspectives.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting different trends across models and languages.

Abstract: Jailbreaking commercial black-box models is one of the most challenging and serious security threats today. Existing attacks achieve certain success on non-reasoning models but perform limitedly on the latest reasoning models. We discover that carefully crafted developer messages can markedly boost jailbreak effectiveness. Building on this, we propose two developer-role-based attacks: D-Attack, which enhances contextual simulation, and DH-CoT, which strengthens attacks with deceptive chain-of-thought. In experiments, we further diccover that current red-teaming datasets often contain samples unsuited for measuring attack gains: prompts that fail to trigger defenses, prompts where malicious content is not the sole valid output, and benign prompts. Such data hinders accurate measurement of the true improvement brought by an attack method. To address this, we introduce MDH, a Malicious content Detection approach combining LLM-based screening with Human verification to balance accuracy and cost, with which we clean data and build the RTA dataset series. Experiments demonstrate that MDH reliably filters low-quality samples and that developer messages significantly improve jailbreak attack success. Codes, datasets, and other results will be released in https://github.com/AlienZhang1996/DH-CoT.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness, achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K, and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge, individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its strong potential for real-world clinical decision support.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts (Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities (e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches (1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which 1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for understanding democratic discourse.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge. Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use. MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale), revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex, real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations between musical preferences and personality, while separate studies have demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals' musical preferences leave traces in their spontaneous language through the lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality analysis.

<title>Tailored Teaching with Balanced Difficulty: Elevating Reasoning in Multimodal Chain-of-Thought via Prompt Curriculum</title>

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual f low in a limited context window. Retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) methods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA and GutenQAdataset, showing substantial improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

<title>Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a dominant post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. Despite its success with larger models, applying RL to compact models (e.g., 0.5--1B parameters) presents unique challenges. The compact models exhibit poor initial performance, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which employs cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To understand how compact models preserve agentic behavior, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) improved role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques-character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling-which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool Source code is available at https://github.com/scb-10x/apo

Abstract: With the growing accessibility and wide adoption of large language models, concerns about their safety and alignment with human values have become paramount. In this paper, we identify a concerning phenomenon: Reasoning-Induced Misalignment (RIM), in which misalignment emerges when reasoning capabilities strengthened-particularly when specific types of reasoning patterns are introduced during inference or training. Beyond reporting this vulnerability, we provide the first mechanistic account of its origins. Through representation analysis, we discover that specific attention heads facilitate refusal by reducing their attention to CoT tokens, a mechanism that modulates the model's rationalization process during inference. During training, we find significantly higher activation entanglement between reasoning and safety in safety-critical neurons than in control neurons, particularly after fine-tuning with those identified reasoning patterns. This entanglement strongly correlates with catastrophic forgetting, providing a neuron-level explanation for RIM.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Abstract: This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies. First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful rather than helpful. Prior work has primarily focused on debates within homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a decrease in accuracy over time - even in settings where stronger (i.e., more capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. We perform additional experiments investigating various potential contributing factors to these harmful shifts - including sycophancy, social conformity, and model and task type. These results highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance degradation when agents are neither incentivised nor adequately equipped to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB) complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English. Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded, human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach: fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the original document.

Abstract: Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution. Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

This work addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1 score of 68.92% outperforming baseline detectors by 22.47%. Benchmarking five hallucination mitigation architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy (96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy.

Abstract: Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVDecode), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVDecode is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVDecode paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 percentage points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 percentage points, with similar gains (1-2 percentage points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter. SVDecode thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger task adaptation for large language models.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) extend context lengths to millions of tokens, enabling coherent, personalized responses grounded in long conversational histories. This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV) caching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly becomes the bottleneck in resource-constrained environments. An active line of research for reducing memory bottleneck is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while preserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i) evicting the KV cache after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and (ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to failure cases in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a training-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question answering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth through block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV compression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and applies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to eviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across three LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40%, maintains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and reduces latency/memory by up to 2.4x/3.5x, enabling efficient multi-turn interaction under strict resource limits. Our code is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-epicache.

Abstract: This paper investigates part-of-speech tagging, an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the Nagamese language. The Nagamese language, a.k.a. Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified Creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the Nagas and people from Assam in northeast India. A substantial amount of work in part-of-speech-tagging has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in the Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at part-of-speech tagging for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to identify the part-of-speech for a given sentence in the Nagamese language. An annotated corpus of 16,112 tokens is created and applied machine learning technique known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Using CRF, an overall tagging accuracy of 85.70%; precision, recall of 86%, and f1-score of 85% is achieved.

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.

<title>Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning: Dual-Fact Alignment for Long-Form Factuality</title>

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries, exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

<title>MemGen: Weaving Generative Latent Memory for Self-Evolving Agents</title>

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to $38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties, including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

<title>DiaCDM: Cognitive Diagnosis in Teacher-Student Dialogues using the Initiation-Response-Evaluation Framework</title>

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/DiaCDM/tree/main.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are nowadays expected to generate content aligned with human preferences. Current work focuses on alignment at model training time, through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, it is unclear if such methods are an effective choice to teach alignment objectives to the model. First, the inability to incorporate multiple, custom rewards and reliance on a model developer's view of universal and static principles are key limitations. Second, the reliability of such approaches is also questionable (e.g. susceptibility to jailbreaking even after safety training). To address these issues, we propose DeAL, a framework that allows the user to customize reward functions and enables Decoding-time Alignment of LLMs (DeAL). At its core, we view decoding as a heuristic-guided search process and facilitate the use of a wide variety of alignment objectives. Our experiments with programmatic constraints such as keyword and length constraints, and abstract objectives such as harmlessness and helpfulness, show that we can DeAL with fine-grained trade-offs and improve adherence to alignment objectives. Lastly, we demonstrate that DeAL is largely complementary to existing alignment strategies, and can be effectively paired with RLHF and prompting techniques to achieve better alignment.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is an emerging sub-field of interpretability that seeks to understand a neural network model by reverse-engineering its internal computations. Recently, MI has garnered significant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs), resulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges. However, there has not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges, particularly as a guide for newcomers to this field. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey from a task-centric perspective, organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks. We outline the fundamental objects of study in MI, along with the techniques, evaluation methods, and key findings for each task in the taxonomy. In particular, we present a task-centric taxonomy as a roadmap for beginners to navigate the field by helping them quickly identify impactful problems in which they are most interested and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in the field and suggest potential future directions for MI research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient, human-inspired access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and $\infty$-Bench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens -- a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting parallels between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.

Abstract: This work presents an analytical framework for the design and analysis of LLM-based algorithms, i.e., algorithms that contain one or multiple calls of large language models (LLMs) as sub-routines and critically rely on the capabilities of LLMs. While such algorithms, ranging from basic LLM calls with prompt engineering to complicated LLM-powered agentic workflows and compound AI systems, have achieved remarkable empirical success, their design and optimization oftentimes require extensive trial-and-errors and case-by-case analysis. Our proposed framework serves as an attempt to mitigate such headaches, offering a formal and systematic approach for analyzing how the accuracy and efficiency of an LLM-based algorithm will be impacted by critical design choices, such as the pattern and granularity of task decomposition, or the prompt for each LLM call. Through a wide range of case studies covering diverse algorithm patterns (including parallel/hierarchical/recursive task decomposition and generic directed acyclic graphs), we demonstrate the proposed framework in action and derive interesting insights that generalize across scenarios, accompanied by systematic empirical validation in synthetic settings.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini has shown their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands, limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality, harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness. Meanwhile, this approach can extend to multimodal large language models and LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Human label variation (HLV) challenges the standard assumption that a labelled instance has a single ground truth, instead embracing the natural variation in human annotation to train and evaluate models. While various training methods and metrics for HLV have been proposed, it is still unclear which methods and metrics perform best in what settings. We propose new evaluation metrics for HLV leveraging fuzzy set theory. Since these new proposed metrics are differentiable, we then in turn experiment with employing these metrics as training objectives. We conduct an extensive study over 6 HLV datasets testing 14 training methods and 6 evaluation metrics. We find that training on either disaggregated annotations or soft labels performs best across metrics, outperforming training using the proposed training objectives with differentiable metrics. We also show that our proposed soft micro F1 score is one of the best metrics for HLV data.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated theorem proving use Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate informal mathematical statements into formal proofs. However, informal cues are often ambiguous or lack strict logical structure, making it hard for models to interpret them precisely. While existing methods achieve strong performance, little is known about how LLMs internally represent informal cues, or how these influence proof generation. To address this, we explore \textit{activation steering}, an inference-time intervention that identifies linear directions in residual activations associated with informal reasoning traces and adjusts them to improve proof construction without fine-tuning. This mechanism also yields interpretable information about how reasoning is internally encoded in the activation space of LLMs. We test our method for generating formal proofs from already-formalized theorems. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel activation-based intervention for guiding proof synthesis in LLMs; and (2) demonstration that this intervention improves performance under two decoding strategies (sampling and best-first search) without any further training.

Abstract: Layer normalization (LN) is an essential component of modern neural networks. While many alternative techniques have been proposed, none of them have succeeded in replacing LN so far. The latest suggestion in this line of research is a dynamic activation function called Dynamic Tanh (DyT). Although it is empirically well-motivated and appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between LN and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT from the LN variant RMSNorm, and show that a well-defined decoupling in derivative space as well as an approximation are needed to do so. By applying the same decoupling procedure directly in function space, we are able to omit the approximation and obtain the exact element-wise counterpart of RMSNorm, which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). We demonstrate numerically that DyISRU reproduces the normalization effect on outliers more accurately than DyT does.

Abstract: We propose L2T, an advancement of visual instruction tuning (VIT). While VIT equips Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with promising multimodal capabilities, the current design choices for VIT often result in overfitting and shortcut learning, potentially degrading performance. This gap arises from an overemphasis on instruction-following abilities, while neglecting the proactive understanding of visual information. Inspired by this, L2T adopts a simple yet effective approach by incorporating the loss function into both the instruction and response sequences. It seamlessly expands the training data, and regularizes the MLLMs from overly relying on language priors. Based on this merit, L2T achieves a significant relative improvement of up to 9% on comprehensive multimodal benchmarks, requiring no additional training data and incurring negligible computational overhead. Surprisingly, L2T attains exceptional fundamental visual capabilities, yielding up to an 18% improvement in captioning performance, while simultaneously alleviating hallucination in MLLMs. Github code: https://github.com/Feng-Hong/L2T.

Abstract: Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input, suggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly enhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent efforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing evaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic, narrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally, training exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms.

Abstract: Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted paradigm for enabling knowledge-grounded large language models (LLMs). However, standard RAG pipelines often fail to ensure that model reasoning remains consistent with the evidence retrieved, leading to factual inconsistencies or unsupported conclusions. In this work, we reinterpret RAG as Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning and identify a central but underexplored problem: Reasoning Misalignment -- the divergence between an LLM's internal reasoning trajectory and the evidential constraints provided by retrieval. To address this issue, we propose AlignRAG, a novel iterative framework grounded in Critique-Driven Alignment (CDA). We further introduce AlignRAG-auto, an autonomous variant that dynamically terminates refinement, removing the need to pre-specify the number of critique iterations. At the heart of AlignRAG lies a contrastive critique synthesis mechanism that generates retrieval-sensitive critiques while mitigating self-bias. This mechanism trains a dedicated retrieval-augmented Critic Language Model (CLM) using labeled critiques that distinguish between evidence-aligned and misaligned reasoning. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly improves reasoning fidelity. Our 8B-parameter CLM improves performance over the Self-Refine baseline by 12.1% on out-of-domain tasks and outperforms a standard 72B-parameter CLM by 2.2%. Furthermore, AlignRAG-auto achieves this state-of-the-art performance while dynamically determining the optimal number of refinement steps, enhancing efficiency and usability. AlignRAG remains compatible with existing RAG architectures as a plug-and-play module and demonstrates strong robustness under both informative and noisy retrieval scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4\% absolute on SAT MATH). Furthermore, we benchmark our PRM against existing open-source reward models, demonstrating superior alignment with reasoning quality and more consistent guidance for downstream generation. Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: We present ViDRiP-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, including single patch images, automatically segmented pathology video clips, and manually segmented pathology videos. This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/QuIIL/ViDRiP-LLaVA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control, and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in safety-critical scenarios. Existing methods for black-box models often detect hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a multi-agent driving environment. We then propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using adaptive stress testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that cause language models to act with high uncertainty or even crash. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show through extensive experiments that offline analyses can be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM. We further characterize LLMs deployed as planners in a single-agent lunar lander environment and in a multi-agent robot crowd navigation simulation. Overall, ours is one of the first hallucination intervention algorithms to pave a path towards rigorous characterization of black-box LLM planners.

<title>mCLM: A Modular Chemical Language Model that Generates Functional and Makeable Molecules</title>

Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with desired functions (e.g., drug-like properties). In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make, and are almost never compatible with automated synthesis approaches. To better enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a new molecular language that is more effective in predicting properties and inherently synced with automated synthesis technology. Current molecule LLMs are limited by representing molecules based on atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into meaning-bearing (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be tokenized at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model that comprises a bilingual language model that understands both natural language descriptions of functions and molecular blocks. mCLM front-loads synthesizability considerations while improving the predicted functions of molecules in a principled manner. mCLM, with only 3B parameters, achieves improvements in synthetic accessibility relative to 7 other leading generative AI methods including GPT-5. When tested on 122 out-of-distribution medicines using only building blocks/tokens that are compatible with automated modular synthesis, mCLM outperforms all baselines in property scores and synthetic accessibility. mCLM can also reason on multiple functions and iteratively self-improve to rescue drug candidates that failed late in clinical trials ("fallen angels").

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies. To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but often incur high inference costs during deployment. To mitigate hallucination, many systems use a knowledge graph to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG). However, the large amount of retrieved knowledge contexts increase these inference costs further. A promising solution to balance performance and cost is LLM routing, which directs simple queries to smaller LLMs and complex ones to larger LLMs. However, no dedicated routing methods currently exist for RAG, and existing training-based routers face challenges scaling to this domain due to the need for extensive training data. We observe that the score distributions produced by the retrieval scorer strongly correlate with query difficulty. Based on this, we propose an extremely simple yet effective routing framework, the first specifically designed for KG-RAG that efficiently balances performance and cost in a plug-and-play manner. It delivers over 3x higher routing effectiveness while reducing runtime to less than 0.001x compared to existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrwang00/SkewRoute.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in transformer interpretability, an understanding of the computational mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge. Many approaches interpret a network's hidden representations but remain agnostic about how those representations are generated. We address this by mapping LLM inference for a given input sequence to an equivalent and interpretable linear system which reconstructs the predicted output embedding with relative error below $10^{-13}$ at double floating-point precision, requiring no additional model training. We exploit a property of transformers wherein every operation (gated activations, attention, and normalization) can be expressed as $A(x) \cdot x$, where $A(x)$ represents an input-dependent linear transform and $x$ preserves the linear pathway. To expose this linear structure, we strategically detach components of the gradient computation with respect to an input sequence, freezing the $A(x)$ terms at their values computed during inference, such that the Jacobian yields an equivalent linear mapping. This detached Jacobian of the model reconstructs the output with one linear operator per input token, which is shown for Qwen 3, Gemma 3 and Llama 3, up to Qwen 3 14B. These linear representations demonstrate that LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where the singular vectors can be decoded to interpretable semantic concepts. The computation for each intermediate output also has a linear equivalent, and we examine how the linear representations of individual layers and their attention and multilayer perceptron modules build predictions, and use these as steering operators to insert semantic concepts into unrelated text. Despite their global nonlinearity, LLMs can be interpreted through equivalent linear representations that reveal low-dimensional semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance across multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, how vision information contributes to the model's decoding process remains under-explored, as reflected in frequent hallucinations. Through a series of analyses, we found that (i) vision tokens provide meaningful visual information even when hallucinations occur, and (ii) their semantics are encoded in the textual space and become explicit under appropriate vocabulary constraints. Building on these observations, we propose ReVisiT, a simple training-free decoding method that references vision tokens to guide text generation. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution. Specifically, ReVisiT dynamically selects the most relevant vision token at each decoding step via context-aware constrained divergence minimization, and using its constrained projection to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Across five benchmarks on recent LVLMs, ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead, and achieves competitive or superior results to state-of-the-art decoding baselines while reducing computational cost by up to $2\times$.

<title>Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11035</link>

arXiv:2506.11035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception of similarity. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity with psychological plausibility based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of their common and distinctive features. This model of similarity has not been used in deep learning before, in part because of the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. In this paper, we develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive basic neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling neural networks, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer. For instance, on the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.8%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both types of projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in modern deep learning, and designing neural networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.

<title>Wide-Horizon Thinking and Simulation-Based Evaluation for Real-World LLM Planning with Multifaceted Constraints</title>

arXiv:2506.12421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike reasoning, which often entails a deep sequence of deductive steps, complex real-world planning is characterized by the need to synthesize a broad spectrum of parallel and potentially conflicting information and constraints. For example, in travel planning scenarios, it requires the integration of diverse real-world information and user preferences. While LLMs show promise, existing methods with long-horizon thinking struggle with handling multifaceted constraints, leading to suboptimal solutions. Motivated by the challenges of real-world travel planning, this paper introduces the Multiple Aspects of Planning (MAoP), empowering LLMs with "wide-horizon thinking" to solve planning problems with multifaceted constraints. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the planning blueprint for planners, enabling strong inference-time scalability by scaling aspects to consider various constraints. In addition, existing benchmarks for multi-constraint planning are flawed because they assess constraints in isolation, ignoring causal dependencies within the constraints, e.g, travel planning, where past activities dictate future itinerary. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an agent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world simulation, thereby inherently resolving these causal dependencies. This paper advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through simulation.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two small open models ($~3B$) we split the training data into complexity categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.58$ vs $0.45$ average accuracy) and outperforms the distillation approach ($0.58$ vs $0.56$ average accuracy) while using $81%$ less data.

<title>Investigating VLM Hallucination from a Cognitive Psychology Perspective: A First Step Toward Interpretation with Intriguing Observations</title>

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, and may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' cognitive biases that lead to hallucinations, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: appeal to authority. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.

arXiv:2507.09279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of scientific knowledge presents a grand challenge: transforming this vast repository of information into an active engine for discovery, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare. Current AI agents, however, are constrained by static, predefined strategies, limiting their ability to navigate the complex, evolving ecosystem of scientific research. This paper introduces HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, structured knowledge base, enabling it to learn not just how to use tools, but how to strategize. To anchor our research and provide a community resource, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex health data analysis tasks systematically derived from peer-reviewed scientific literature. Our experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work offers a new paradigm for intelligent systems that can learn to operationalize the procedural knowledge embedded in scientific content, marking a critical step toward more autonomous and effective AI for healthcare scientific discovery.

arXiv:2508.03501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on applications of reinforcement learning (RL) to large language models has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn Markov decision processes (MDPs), this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Our methodology begins with rejection fine-tuning (RFT) using execution feedback to train a policy to follow instructions and formatting effectively, followed by a synchronous RL pipeline using DAPO for iterative improvement. Applying this pipeline to Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, we increase its Pass@1 on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from 11% to 39%, substantially improving upon the 20% RFT baseline. On the May and June splits of SWE-rebench, the resulting agent achieves Pass@1 of 35% and 31% respectively, competitive with even larger models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 or Qwen3-235B-A22B, demonstrating that our methodology offers a practical approach for training capable agents for multi-turn interactive tasks using open-weight models.

Abstract: Despite Retrieval-Augmented Generation improving code completion, traditional retrieval methods struggle with information redundancy and a lack of diversity within limited context windows. To solve this, we propose a resource-optimized retrieval augmentation method, SaraCoder. It maximizes information diversity and representativeness in a limited context window, significantly boosting the accuracy and reliability of repository-level code completion. Its core Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks demonstrate that SaraCoder outperforms existing baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and resource-optimized repository-level code completion systems.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We first propose a holistic taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms baselines across model sizes and evaluation datasets, with the largest gains on the Qwen3-8B-Base model.

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based Transformer architectures, we propose the Iterative Implicit Euler Transformer (IIET), which simplifies high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we introduce Iteration Influence-Aware Distillation (IIAD). Through a flexible threshold, IIAD allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65% over vanilla Transformers and 0.8% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET, significantly cuts inference overhead by 55% while retaining 99.4% of the original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an average performance gain exceeding 1.6% over vanilla Transformer with comparable speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task. Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models on our benchmark, providing extensive results and key insights into their capabilities and limitations.

<title>Retro*: Optimizing LLMs for Reasoning-Intensive Document Retrieval</title>

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

<title>From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones</title>

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces the Poison-to-Poison (P2P) algorithm as a general and effective defense against data-poisoning backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs). By injecting benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and utilizing prompt-based learning during fine-tuning, P2P forces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, overriding malicious triggers. The algorithm proves effective across task settings and attack types, neutralizing backdoors while maintaining task performance. Experimental results on various tasks and LLMs show a significant reduction in attack success rate compared to baseline models. P2P offers a promising approach to enhancing the security and trustworthiness of LLMs and can potentially guide future developments in defending against backdoor attacks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of a secure and trustworthy LLM community.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, large language models, adaptive sampling, online post-training, reasoning tasks

Summary:
Reinforce-Ada is an adaptive sampling framework for online post-training of large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning. It dynamically reallocates sampling effort to prompts with the highest uncertainty or learning potential, improving stability and efficiency. Unlike traditional methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in a continuous process, stopping sampling once enough information is gathered. It forms fixed-size groups with diverse rewards and computes advantage baselines using global statistics. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and enhances final performance compared to GRPO, particularly with balanced sampling. This work underscores the importance of variance-aware and adaptive data curation for effective reinforcement learning in reasoning-capable LLMs. The code for Reinforce-Ada is available on GitHub at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world applicability.

<div> Keywords: Test-Time Scaling, LLM reasoning, candidate diversity, unsafe outputs, diversity reduction protocol

Summary: 
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) aims to improve language model reasoning by exploring multiple candidate responses to find the best output. However, a lack of candidate diversity can lead to an increased likelihood of producing unsafe outputs. This study introduces a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) to stress test TTS pipelines and demonstrates that constraining diversity significantly impacts the generation of unsafe results. This phenomenon is observed across various TTS strategies and models, highlighting the general nature of the problem. Existing safety guardrail classifiers are found to be ineffective in detecting adversarial input prompts generated through diversity reduction. The findings emphasize the importance of designing robust TTS strategies that are resilient to diversity-targeted stress tests, such as those illustrated by RefDiv. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed, even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as illustrated by RefDiv.

Summary:
HAREN-CTC is a novel architecture for speech-based depression detection that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention in a multitask learning framework. It includes a Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module for reorganizing SSL features and a Cross-Modal Fusion module for modeling inter-layer dependencies. The use of Connectionist Temporal Classification loss enables alignment-aware training to track irregular temporal patterns of depressive speech cues. Evaluation of HAREN-CTC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA, outperforming previous methods in both standard data splits and a generalization setting with five-fold cross-validation. <div>

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse, heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations, yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

A new framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that goes beyond standard benchmarks is proposed in the article. The framework utilizes gpt-3.5-turbo to generate structured reasoning on the GSM8K dataset and gpt-4o-mini for error categorization and unsupervised clustering of reasoning sentences to identify emerging "reasoning modes." The analysis reveals a cognitive profile of the machine learning model with strengths in procedural modes like sequential calculation but weaknesses in modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions. This brittleness in specific reasoning skills indicates a nonhuman-like performance. By quantifying the reliability of different reasoning skills, the study offers a more detailed way to evaluate mathematical comprehension and suggests a roadmap for enhancing the model's capabilities for future applications. <div>

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and, crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills, our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable future applications.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces the Confidence Score (CS) as a less biased alternative to traditional metrics like self-perplexity for evaluating creative text generation. Experiments conducted on gpt-4o-mini demonstrate that while conventional fluency-based metrics show a preference for familiar responses in all cases on 99 creative prompts, the CS favors novel responses in 19% of instances, signifying a significant difference. The CS is proven effective in distinguishing between easy, medium, and hard tasks, with non-overlapping confidence intervals validating this capability. By mitigating the creativity bias present in standard metrics while preserving their fundamental assessment strengths, the Confidence Score offers a more balanced and comprehensive evaluation method for modern language modeling models.<br /> <div>

Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%, 27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium, and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced assessment for modern LLMs.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Recover-LoRA, a method designed to recover model accuracies in degraded language models caused by various inference optimizations. Recover-LoRA utilizes synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective layers, aligning the degraded model with its full precision version. The study examines the application of Recover-LoRA on small language models (SLMs) with different attention architectures, including multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), across various evaluation datasets. Results demonstrate that Recover-LoRA can improve model accuracies by 5-17% in MHA and GQA SLMs. This research highlights the importance of recovering accuracy in language models that have experienced functional degradations, offering a lightweight and dataset agnostic solution for model accuracy recovery. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model. We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures, multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

<div> Memory, Long-term, Dialogue, Mnemosyne, Healthcare

Summary:
Mnemosyne is a new unsupervised long-term memory architecture designed for edge-based large language models (LLMs). It uses graph-structured storage, substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay. Mnemosyne also introduces a concentrated "core summary" to capture user personality and domain-specific details. In healthcare applications, it can store information like post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. In experiments with longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne outperformed baseline methods in realism and long-term memory capability. It achieved high scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval, showcasing improved factual recall and natural user-facing responses. This edge-compatible memory architecture offers enhanced performance and transferability for LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However, current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example, post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall, enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory architecture.

<div> Keywords: large language models, AI-generated text, detection methods, out-of-distribution, one-class learning

Summary: 
The article discusses the need for reliable detection methods to differentiate between human and machine-generated text, focusing on the limitations of existing binary classification approaches. It argues that human texts are diverse and do not conform to a single distribution, making it challenging for classifiers to generalize effectively. The proposed approach reframes the detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, treating human-written texts as outliers. By utilizing one-class learning methods and score-based learning techniques, the framework achieves robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets validate the efficacy of the OOD-based method, showcasing high AUROC and AUPR scores with low FPR95. Moreover, the framework demonstrates resilience and adaptability in multilingual, attacked, and unseen-model and -domain text settings. The code, pretrained weights, and demo of the framework will be made available. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked, and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be released.

Summary:
The study introduces a pathology vector database covering 28 subfields with 1.53 million paragraphs. The YpathRAG framework is presented, integrating hybrid retrieval methods with an LLM-based judgment module to enhance retrieval quality. Two evaluation benchmarks, YpathR and YpathQA-M, are released to assess the performance of the framework. YpathRAG achieves a significant improvement in Recall@5 on YpathR compared to the baseline. Furthermore, on the challenging question set YpathQA-M, it enhances the accuracy of both general and medical LLMs. These results highlight the improved retrieval quality and factual reliability of the pathology-oriented RAG framework, offering a scalable construction approach and interpretable evaluation method for this domain. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3 dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks, YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of 23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

<div> Jailbreaks, Adversarial Attacks, Language Models, LatentBreak, Perplexity<br />
Summary: 
Automated jailbreak attacks aim to bypass safety mechanisms in large language models. Existing methods can be detected using perplexity-based filtering, but LatentBreak, a white-box jailbreak attack, generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity to evade defenses. Instead of adding high-perplexity suffixes or templates, LatentBreak substitutes words in the prompt with semantically-equivalent ones to maintain the original intent. It minimizes distances in the latent space between adversarial and harmless prompts. Evaluations show LatentBreak results in shorter and low-perplexity prompts, making it more effective than other algorithms against perplexity-based filters on various models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak, a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

Summary:
In the study, Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is examined as a challenging task due to sparse discriminative evidence, localized cues, and asynchronous modalities. A unified model is proposed that focuses on detecting emotion hotspots in text, audio, and video, and fusing them with global features through Hotspot-Gated Fusion. The model also aligns modalities using a routed Mixture-of-Aligners and incorporates a cross-modal graph to encode conversational structure. Experimental results on standard ERC benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines, with ablations validating the effectiveness of Hotspot-Gated Fusion and Mixture-of-Aligners. The study highlights the importance of a hotspot-centric approach in multimodal learning, providing insights into modality fusion in ERC. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA. Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs' cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over 79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer. Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii) cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored. In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge (NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models' judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender. These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

<div> Keywords: mathematical reasoning, language models, math word problems, distracting conditions, dataset

Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating the intelligence of large language models (LLMs) using math word problems (MWPs). Existing MWP datasets often lack distracting or excessive conditions, leading to a drop in LLM performance when such conditions are introduced. The authors propose an iterative framework that leverages LLMs to automatically generate distracting conditions for MWPs. By designing prompts to revise problems from multiple perspectives, the framework encourages the creation of meaningful distractions without altering the original solution. This approach preserves shared solutions between original and revised problems, reducing the effort required to generate high-quality MWP datasets. Overall, the framework offers a more efficient and reliable method for integrating distracting conditions into MWPs for intelligence testing of LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs) represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

Summary:
The article discusses the potential inflation of benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to memorization of test items or near duplicates. A protocol is presented to probe generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of benchmark questions. The study focuses on Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct models, measuring the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge. The pipeline used controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics. The findings reveal a non-trivial accuracy drop when comparing original and paraphrased items, highlighting concerns about contamination and brittle surface-form shortcuts. <div>

Summary: JAI-1 is a Thai-centric language model with 75B parameters that adopts an upscaling strategy. Unlike existing models that simply add Thai-specific training without modifying the structure, JAI-1 expands from a high-performing English model and systematically integrates Thai-language knowledge. With exposure to 1.5T tokens during pre-training and fine-tuning using over 600K examples, JAI-1 outperforms Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks. This approach preserves general intelligence and establishes a unique architecture for future enhancements. <div>

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with 75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing open-source models, applying additional training without structural modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models, enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks (IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

<br />Summary: <br />This study examines the impact of user profiles, including age, gender, and occupation, on the performance of a sales-oriented agent in dialogues. While age and gender play a role in dialogue outcomes, occupation has the most significant influence on conversational intent. By incorporating occupation-specific dialogue strategies, the agent can prioritize user preferences, leading to more successful and efficient conversations. The research underscores the importance of considering diverse user profiles in simulation studies and demonstrates the effectiveness of persona-informed strategies in enhancing sales-oriented dialogue systems. <div>

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight, occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, software requirements, user stories, text-to-story alignment, evaluation

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) can automate the generation of software requirements from natural language inputs such as elicitation interviews. Evaluating if these requirements align with stakeholders' needs is traditionally a manual process. Text2Stories introduces a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment, quantifying correctness and completeness of requirements. By segmenting interview transcripts and aligning them with user stories, a matching problem is solved. Experiments show that an LLM-based matcher achieves high accuracy, enabling comparison across sets of stories and providing a scalable, source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable, source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

<div> Keywords: Structured information extraction, JSON schemas, LLM agents, PARSE, extraction accuracy
Summary:
Structured information extraction from unstructured text is crucial for Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents interact with APIs. Current approaches use large language models with JSON schemas but may result in suboptimal extraction and unreliable behavior due to static contracts. Recognizing JSON schemas as natural language understanding contracts, the PARSE system is developed with ARCHITECT optimizing JSON schemas for LLM usage and SCOPE implementing extraction with guardrails. Evaluation on various datasets shows a significant improvement in extraction accuracy, with up to 64.7% enhancement on Structured Web Data Extraction. Overall, PARSE reduces extraction errors by 92% on the first retry and maintains practical latency.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7% improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

<div> Keywords: large language models, evaluation scent, performance inflation, benchmarking, real-world deployment

Summary: 
Evaluation scent in benchmarks for large language models may lead to inflated performance without actual capability gains. A study using a single model examined scenarios with varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth. Results showed that evaluation framing increased chain-of-thought length and reduced answer-only compliance, with limited accuracy gains. While it improved structured outputs like wrappers, it did not significantly impact substance validation. Incentive wording affected error composition, with caution praises improving accuracy and confidence praises leading to riskier outputs. Multilingual benchmarks posed parity risks, with Urdu headers potentially decreasing accuracy at higher reasoning depths. The study provides a reproducible A/B framework and practical guidance for ensuring that benchmark gains align with deployable capability, recommending measures such as neutral phrasing, contract-aware grading, and multilingual dashboards. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such "evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High): deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers. Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting, confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark gains reflect deployable capability.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Small Language Models, Recommendation, Thought Space, PULSE

Summary: 
PULSE is a framework that leverages Small Language Models to enhance recommendation systems by treating SLM-generated rationales as learning signals. By creating a common understanding of user behaviors and item preferences in a Thought Space, PULSE combines user actions and semantic drivers to improve reasoning capabilities. Unlike existing models that focus on interactions alone, PULSE considers rationales as valuable signals, resulting in robust and generalizable embeddings. Experimental results show that PULSE outperforms traditional recommendation models and even Large Language Model-based methods across various datasets. Furthermore, PULSE demonstrates strong transferability in cross-domain recommendation tasks and performs well in reasoning-oriented question answering tasks. This approach represents a promising direction for efficient and effective recommendation systems that utilize the power of Small Language Models. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models (SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals, supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions (what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented question answering.

Summary: 
ExPO-HM introduces a novel approach to detecting hateful memes online. It addresses the limitations of binary detection models by incorporating explanation-driven detection, providing context and explanations for moderation. The system combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum learning, and CDE to improve reasoning quality and performance. It outperforms baseline models on binary detection, fine-grained classification, and reasoning quality across three benchmark datasets. By moving beyond simple binary predictions, ExPO-HM offers accurate, interpretable, and actionable support for moderation of hateful memes on online platforms. This advancement in automated detection systems enhances the ability to identify and address online abuse effectively. <div>
arXiv:2510.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification, and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate, interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

<div> diffusion model, language modeling, hierarchical, text generation, ELBO

Summary:<br /><br />In this paper, the authors introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM), a novel approach for language modeling. HDLM utilizes a hierarchical vocabulary where tokens are mapped from detailed to abstract semantics. The model utilizes a forward process where tokens are perturbed to higher-level ancestors based on a scheduler and a reverse process for predicting more detailed semantics. Closed-form expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) are derived, demonstrating the flexibility of HDLM and its relation to existing models like MDLM. Practical training techniques based on these insights are proposed. Text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of HDLM, showing lower validation and generative perplexity compared to baseline models. <div>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative perplexity than baselines.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Chain-of-Thought, Reasoning, CoT Compression, Upfront CoT

Summary:
Upfront CoT (UCoT) is a novel framework for efficient reasoning in large language models. It automates the process of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) compression by using a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor) in a cooperative workflow. The compressor generates upfront thought embeddings rich in reasoning information for the executor, eliminating the need for laborious prompt designing. The executor then utilizes these embeddings to derive correct answers with short reasoning, resulting in significant reduction in CoT length without compromising on reasoning ability. Experimental results demonstrate that UCoT achieves a 50% reduction in token usage on the GSM8K dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods, with a performance improvement of 3.08%. This innovative approach combines efficiency and accuracy in reasoning tasks, offering a promising solution for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning, using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by 50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework for analyzing stylistic choices in personal narratives. It emphasizes the importance of language in conveying subjective experiences and presents a systematic approach to understanding how authors construct their stories. By integrating functional linguistics, computer science methods for pattern analysis, and psychological insights, the framework extracts linguistic features from text, such as processes, participants, and circumstances. Through the analysis of hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, distinctive patterns emerge, highlighting the dominance of verbal processes over mental ones in certain instances. This illustrates a link between linguistic choices and psychological states, shedding light on how authors use language to express and make sense of their experiences.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and psychological states.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel framework that combines Language Model AI scoring with traditional rating scales to create augmented psychological assessments. Using depression as a case study, the framework was tested on real-world and synthetic datasets of upper secondary students, showing significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy. The Language Model items provided information equivalent to adding additional traditional test items, without the need for pre-labelled data or complex rubrics. By empirically selecting the most informative Language Model scoring instructions, this approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring methods. The framework demonstrates a scalable approach for integrating transcribed text data into psychometric measures, with potential applications in clinical health and beyond.

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy. The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3 (real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility in clinical health and beyond.

Summary:
The article introduces dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for diffusion-based large language model (dLLM) inference. dInfer breaks down the inference process into four modular components and integrates novel algorithms and system-level optimizations to achieve substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing output quality. It outperforms existing systems such as Fast-dLLM and even competes favorably against autoregressive models like QWen2.5-3B, delivering significant speedups while maintaining similar model performance. dInfer achieves impressive throughput on various benchmarks, surpassing 1,100 tokens per second at batch size 1 on HumanEval and averaging over 800 tokens per second on 8x H800 GPUs. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced, promoting widespread adoption and further innovation in the field of dLLM inference. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

- Results suggest that the Farseer law provides more accurate predictions for code LLMs.<br />
- Code LLMs scale effectively with model size, but require a higher data-to-parameter ratio than natural language models.<br />

arXiv:2510.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering. However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117 experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from 2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially, code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

Summary:
The article introduces a formal framework for analyzing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of case-based legal reasoning. The framework involves three-stage reasoning tasks: surface-level reasoning, hierarchical reasoning, and integrated analysis. While LLMs excel at surface-level reasoning, their performance declines significantly when it comes to hierarchical reasoning and integrated analysis. Surprisingly, the models spend more computational resources on incorrect responses than on correct ones. This finding highlights the need to address fundamental limitations in LLMs to ensure robust and trustworthy legal AI. The study showcases the importance of fine-grained analysis in evaluating LLM reasoning capabilities and emphasizes the complexity of nuanced reasoning required in legal practice. <div>

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, test case evaluation, benchmark construction, fault coverage, diagnostic power
Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenge of evaluating test cases generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). They propose a framework for constructing benchmarks that aims to determine the minimal set of wrong codes necessary to represent the entire error space and the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish them. By formalizing benchmark construction as finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix, they develop an efficient approximation algorithm called WrongSelect to select maximally diverse wrong codes. This results in the creation of TC-Bench, a compact, diverse, and inflation-resistant benchmark constructed from competitive programming submissions. Experimental results show that existing test case generation methods have a limited diagnostic power on TC-Bench, highlighting the need for more effective evaluation strategies in this domain. The dataset and code for TC-Bench are publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse, and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power.

<div> micro-benchmarking, language models, evaluation, performance difference, reliability 
Summary:
Micro-benchmarking is a method used to evaluate language models on small subsets of benchmarks to save time and cost. However, research shows that these micro-benchmarks may not consistently rank models as accurately as full benchmarks or random data sampling. A new meta-evaluation measure has been introduced to analyze the reliability of micro-benchmarking in ranking model pairs based on their performance differences on full benchmarks. The study suggests that selecting a minimum of 250 examples may be necessary to consistently rank models with similar performances. Even with 25 examples, micro-benchmarks struggle to preserve pairwise comparisons of 8B instruction-tuned models. The findings highlight the need for balancing evaluation efficiency and reliability in micro-benchmarking for both users and developers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark, allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples; we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5 points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25 examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency and reliability.

Summary: <br />
Geocoding is the process of linking location references to actual geographic locations, crucial for text analysis. This study focuses on geocoding compositional location references using LLMs. Evaluating LLMs' geospatial knowledge and reasoning abilities, a new approach is proposed for improved geocoding.

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger off-the-shelf models.

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent & Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories and improvement in these areas.

<div> Keywords: Transformer, attention, Adaptive Retention, token selection, long-context efficiency

Summary:
Adaptive Retention is proposed as a solution to the quadratic scaling issue of Transformer attention with sequence length. This probabilistic token selection mechanism learns which representations to keep under a global budget constraint. Bernoulli gates are used for retention, trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation method, and enforced with a top-M rule at inference. By keeping only 30-50% of tokens, performance can be preserved at over 95% of the full-model level, while reducing peak memory usage by 35-45% and enhancing throughput by up to 1.8 times. This method is compatible with standard encoders and does not require adjustments to base attention or task heads, making it architecture-agnostic. The approach proves effective across various tasks such as classification, extractive QA, and long-document summarization, offering practical efficiency for long-context processing. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Adaptive Retention addresses the quadratic scaling issue of Transformer attention.
- It utilizes a probabilistic token selection mechanism under a global budget constraint.
- The method preserves performance while reducing memory usage and improving throughput significantly.
- Adaptive Retention is compatible with standard encoders and does not require changes to base attention or task heads.
- This architecture-agnostic approach proves effective across different tasks, providing practical long-context processing efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2), limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic, layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new benchmark, Chinese Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), aimed at evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in integrating Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step logical reasoning. The benchmark is created by constructing a seed set from existing QA datasets and generating multi-hop questions using an LLM-powered pipeline. To ensure data quality, human experts verify and refine the questions. Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using CCMOR reveals limitations in processing long-tail knowledge and executing knowledge-intensive reasoning. However, incorporating retrieval-augmented generation helps overcome these knowledge gaps and improves performance significantly. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions. Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance gains.

Summary: 
MOSAIC is a new multi-agent Large Language Model framework designed to tackle challenging scientific coding tasks. Scientific workflows often require rigorous algorithms with deep domain knowledge and domain-specific reasoning. MOSAIC uses a student-teacher paradigm to self-reflect, create rationale, code, and debug, facilitating stepwise problem decomposition and targeted error correction. The framework includes specially designed agents to address the challenges of scientific code generation without the need for training. The Consolidated Context Window (CCW) helps prevent LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks involving chained subproblems. Experimental results show that MOSAIC outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. This specialized agentic framework shows promise in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of solving scientific coding challenges. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding, scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window (CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction, counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms in LLM deployments.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, knowledge graphs, iterative graph navigation, knowledge-intensive questions, state-of-the-art performance

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called Search-on-Graph (SoG) that enhances large language models' reasoning abilities in answering knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions using knowledge graphs. SoG enables iterative informed graph navigation by allowing the language model to examine available relations at each step before deciding on the next hop. This approach follows an "observe-then-navigate" principle, adapting seamlessly to different knowledge graph schemas and handling high-degree nodes effectively. SoG outperforms existing methods on six knowledge graph question answering benchmarks without requiring fine-tuning. Particularly, strong improvements are seen on Wikidata benchmarks, with a significant overall performance boost in answering complex questions using Freebase and Wikidata knowledge graphs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs: compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an ``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop. This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

Summary: 
The study focuses on the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. The research introduces the Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA) framework consisting of five conversation patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. The evaluation of PE-CoA on twelve LLMs across ten harm categories reveals state-of-the-art performance in uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics. The study highlights the distinct weakness profiles of LLMs, indicating that robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others. Additionally, the research shows that model families share similar failure modes, emphasizing the limitations of current safety training methods and the need for pattern-aware defenses. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities in enhancing the security of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches (educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios). Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

Summary:
In this study, the effectiveness of quality estimation (QE) reranking in document-level translation is examined using various learned and large language model-based metrics. The results show significant improvements in BLEURT-20 scores with the best learned metric, SLIDE, achieving gains of +2.00 with two candidates and +5.09 with 32. Additionally, using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, results in improvements of +1.63 and +4.30 under similar conditions. Although gains decrease with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates still provides enhancements of +2.34 (SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on the longest documents. These findings highlight the practical value of document-level QE reranking, showcasing its potential to enhance machine translation performance with minimal runtime overhead when suitable translation models and hardware are employed. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model (LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE, BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with 32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of +1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34 (SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens). These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

arXiv:2510.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured, interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings, FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning. We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval, classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy, structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

Summary: 
This study introduces a new approach to improve the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by promoting exploration during token sampling. The method applies different temperature settings for high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens to encourage exploration while maintaining factual correctness. Various multi-temperature scheduling strategies are investigated in reinforcement learning contexts to enhance reasoning abilities. The approach significantly enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs in empirical evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks. By applying higher temperatures for reasoning tokens and lower temperatures for knowledge tokens, the approach actively encourages exploration and improves the overall reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The code for the approach is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically, our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/zhmzm/Multi_Temperature_Verl.git.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages.

<div> Keywords: context compression, language model, semantic-anchor compression, autoencoding tasks, compression ratios <br />
Summary: <br />
Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC) is introduced as a novel method for context compression in large language models. Unlike existing methods that rely on autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value representations. This eliminates the need for training models specifically for compression. SAC incorporates anchor embeddings to identify critical tokens and bidirectional attention modification to allow anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results show that SAC outperforms existing methods across various compression ratios, achieving a 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines on out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA. The benefits of SAC become more evident at higher compression ratios, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing compression performance without the limitations of autoencoding tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

<div> impressions, LLMs, stereotypes, language, probes

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of artificial impressions in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing patterns in their internal representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes based on language. Linear probes are fitted on generated prompts to predict impressions according to the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). It is found that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted, but impressions are more consistently decodable from their hidden representations. Artificial impressions of prompts are shown to be predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. The study also investigates how content, stylistic, and dialectal features in prompts impact LLM impressions. <div>

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM). Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted, but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in prompts impact LLM impressions.

<div> Keywords: large language models, SOP-Maze, benchmarks, performance analysis, open-source

Summary: 
The article introduces SOP-Maze, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in complex standard operating procedure (SOP) scenarios commonly found in business environments. SOP-Maze consists of 397 tasks derived from 23 real-world SOP scenarios, categorized into two classes: Lateral Root System (LRS) and Heart Root System (HRS) representing wide-option tasks and deep logical reasoning tasks, respectively. The experiments conducted on SOP-Maze reveal that existing state-of-the-art models struggle with the challenges posed by SOP tasks, with errors primarily falling into three categories: route blindness, conversational fragility, and calculation errors. The systematic analysis provided in the study offers insights into improving LLM capabilities in handling SOP tasks. The code for SOP-Maze has been made open-source on GitHub for further research and development.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures; (ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and (iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on https://github.com/ADoublLEN/SOP-Maze.

<div> Keywords: open source communities, version controlled governance documents, participation, control, entropy

Summary: 
The study examines how open source communities outline participation and control through version controlled governance documents. By analyzing a dataset of 710 projects with paired snapshots, the researchers categorized text into actors, rules, actions, and objects. They then measured changes in governance using entropy for evenness, richness for diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. The results indicate that over time, projects define more roles and actions, with a more even distribution among them, while the composition of rules remains consistent. This suggests that governance in these communities evolves by expanding and balancing categories of participation without significant changes in prescriptive authority. The analysis provides a reproducible benchmark for assessing whether future AI-mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute authority.

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects, then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute authority.

Abstract: Autoformalization serves a crucial role in connecting natural language and formal reasoning. This paper presents MASA, a novel framework for building multi-agent systems for autoformalization driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). MASA leverages collaborative agents to convert natural language statements into their formal representations. The architecture of MASA is designed with a strong emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and extensibility, allowing seamless integration of new agents and tools to adapt to a fast-evolving field. We showcase the effectiveness of MASA through use cases on real-world mathematical definitions and experiments on formal mathematics datasets. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems powered by the interaction of LLMs and theorem provers in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of autoformalization, providing valuable insights and support for researchers and practitioners in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants. However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall performance. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster convergence and superior final performance.

<title>Decoupling Safety into Orthogonal Subspace: Cost-Efficient and Performance-Preserving Alignment for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches. Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries, enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and (ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically, our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human evaluations.

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs. In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall, demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset (Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool, this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning, bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales (1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty. Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness.

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings. Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG, highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG, when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire the development of next-generation RAG systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation (MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear. Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation, assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency, zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval, a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts, and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

TAU is a verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

<title>Stronger Re-identification Attacks through Reasoning and Aggregation</title>

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure. Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2) reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving 15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili. Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement, significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

<title>DICE: Structured Reasoning in LLMs through SLM-Guided Chain-of-Thought Correction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09211</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS (Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables, the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring pre-existing datasets.

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than 400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic post-editor.

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\% relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

<title>Detecting Data Contamination from Reinforcement Learning Post-training for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique. Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase contamination, our method makes detection possible.

arXiv:2510.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity, often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos, yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials, requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all evaluated MLLMs

<title>Inflated Excellence or True Performance? Rethinking Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks with Dynamic Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09275</link>

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions, DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy, DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions: veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency. Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our code is open sourced at: https://github.com/Infinite-set/CLARity

<title>One Sentence, Two Embeddings: Contrastive Learning of Explicit and Implicit Semantic Representations</title>

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

arXiv:2510.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and \textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the \underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View" section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views. Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data.

<title>Mask Tokens as Prophet: Fine-Grained Cache Eviction for Efficient dLLM Inference</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/jianuo-huang/MaskKV

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance, their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon), inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay) often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of 47\% even at 90\% recall.

arXiv:2510.09351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances (14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

<title>Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in large-scale models without costly post-training.

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger counterparts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

<title>Token-Level Policy Optimization: Linking Group-Level Rewards to Token-Level Aggregation via Markov Likelihood</title>

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood) links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics (including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training stability.

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication. However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.

<title>Beyond Single-Granularity Prompts: A Multi-Scale Chain-of-Thought Prompt Learning for Graph</title>

arXiv:2510.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method, particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best LLM for the task.

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text, grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language. Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training. Our code is avalable at https://github.com/VictorMorand/EntityRepresentations .

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches. Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context utilization.

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language, specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore, the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual LLM research.

<title>Domain-Adapted Pre-trained Language Models for Implicit Information Extraction in Crash Narratives</title>

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However, large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in, for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100 categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT. Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations in the dataset.

<title>Getting Your Indices in a Row: Full-Text Search for LLM Training Data for Real World</title>

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.

<title>Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic Logic</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied. Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets, spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings: ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource, linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost. Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems. Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model sizes.

arXiv:2510.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual, real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering, mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

arXiv:2510.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025 M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video collections.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves, i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support future research.

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments, with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time, there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type, with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate, engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity (accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment (timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly communication.

<title>Dyna-Mind: Learning to Simulate from Experience for Better AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' - the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions. ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2, we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts. Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in the ever more challenging environments.

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans, is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity, real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a "Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate "Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process. Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time interaction.

<title>Prompting Test-Time Scaling Is A Strong LLM Reasoning Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism. Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

<title>Comparative Analysis of Large Language Models for the Machine-Assisted Resolution of User Intentions</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional, GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However, extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative. This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded intelligence.

<title>Articulation-Informed ASR: Integrating Articulatory Features into ASR via Auxiliary Speech Inversion and Cross-Attention Fusion</title>

Abstract: Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state. We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings? Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers, we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air M1.

<title>Energy-Driven Steering: Reducing False Refusals in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge: current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference, EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans. As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like India.

<title>BigCodeArena: Unveiling More Reliable Human Preferences in Code Generation via Execution</title>

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source LLM serving systems

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization, including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data, more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and inferencing factors.

We find even simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and maintain the runtime.

Abstract: Many social science questions ask how linguistic properties causally affect an audience's attitudes and behaviors. Because text properties are often interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However, because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself, inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements, offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms, policy makers, and social scientists.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text, overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations, that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy, moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually aware embedding models.

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556) and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a 14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point (pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3 percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect (P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures (+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

<title>Time-Aware Feature Selection: Adaptive Temporal Masking for Stable Sparse Autoencoder Training</title>

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR 2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the growth of scientific publishing.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g., precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations. Demo samples are available at: https://control-audio.github.io/Control-Audio.

<title>HES-SQL: Hybrid Reasoning for Efficient Text-to-SQL with Structural Skeleton Guidance</title>

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\% relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency optimization.

<title>Unleashing Perception-Time Scaling to Multimodal Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

<title>Semantic-Condition Tuning: Fusing Graph Context with Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

<title>Diagnosing and Mitigating System Bias in Self-Rewarding RL</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias: the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses, with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$, $\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that $\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while $\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

<title>On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.

<title>Auto-scaling Continuous Memory for GUI Agent</title>

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500 samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably, Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now routinely used to autonomously execute complex tasks, from natural language processing to dynamic workflows like web searches. The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate long-standing threats.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images, videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary factor limiting performance.

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis), are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Most of the existing speaker anonymization research has focused on single-speaker audio, leading to the development of techniques and evaluation metrics optimized for such condition. This study addresses the significant challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio, specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario. This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training. While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity, we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own, preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.Code is available on Github.

<title>Estimating Brain Activity with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution using a Naturalistic MEG-fMRI Encoding Model</title>

Abstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.

<title>LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?</title>

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data, code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

<title>StreamingVLM: Real-Time Understanding for Infinite Video Streams</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides a practical way for users to customize Large Language Models (LLMs) with their private data in LLM service scenarios. However, the inherently sensitive nature of private data demands robust privacy preservation measures during the customization of LLM services to ensure data security, maintain user trust, and comply with stringent regulatory standards. Based on PEFT, we propose Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (RAPT), a framework that offers privacy protection for LLM services. RAPT adopts a local privacy approach, enabling users to privatize their data locally using a text-to-text local differential privacy mechanism. Since PEFT performs poorly when directly trained on privatized data, we introduce a novel privatized token reconstruction task that is trained jointly with the downstream task, allowing LLMs to learn better task-dependent representations. Despite the simplicity of our framework, experiments show that RAPT achieves competitive performance across tasks while providing privacy guarantees against adversaries.

Abstract: Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.

<title>On the Reliability of Large Language Models for Causal Discovery</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in causal discovery. Using newly available open-source LLMs, OLMo and BLOOM, which provide access to their pre-training corpora, we investigate how LLMs address causal discovery through three research questions. We examine: (i) the impact of memorization for accurate causal relation prediction, (ii) the influence of incorrect causal relations in pre-training data, and (iii) the contextual nuances that influence LLMs' understanding of causal relations. Our findings indicate that while LLMs are effective in recognizing causal relations that occur frequently in pre-training data, their ability to generalize to new or rare causal relations is limited. Moreover, the presence of incorrect causal relations significantly undermines the confidence of LLMs in corresponding correct causal relations, and the contextual information critically affects the outcomes of LLMs to discern causal connections between random variables.

<title>Augmenting Compliance-Guaranteed Customer Service Chatbots: Context-Aware Knowledge Expansion with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-based chatbots leverage human-verified Q\&amp;A knowledge to deliver accurate, verifiable responses, making them ideal for customer-centric applications where compliance with regulatory and operational standards is critical. To effectively handle diverse customer inquiries, augmenting the knowledge base with "similar questions" that retain semantic meaning while incorporating varied expressions is a cost-effective strategy. In this paper, we introduce the Similar Question Generation (SQG) task for LLM training and inference, proposing context-aware approaches to enable comprehensive semantic exploration and enhanced alignment with source question-answer relationships. We formulate optimization techniques for constructing in-context prompts and selecting an optimal subset of similar questions to expand chatbot knowledge under budget constraints. Both quantitative and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of these methods, achieving a 92% user satisfaction rate in a deployed chatbot system, reflecting an 18% improvement over the unaugmented baseline. These findings highlight the practical benefits of SQG and emphasize the potential of LLMs, not as direct chatbot interfaces, but in supporting non-generative systems for hallucination-free, compliance-guaranteed applications.

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial step that bridges human-readable text with model-readable discrete tokens. However, recent studies have revealed that tokenizers can be exploited to elicit unwanted model behaviors. In this work, we investigate incomplete tokens, i.e., undecodable tokens with stray bytes resulting from byte-level byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization. We hypothesize that such tokens are heavily reliant on their adjacent tokens and are fragile when paired with unfamiliar tokens. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we introduce improbable bigrams: out-of-distribution combinations of incomplete tokens designed to exploit their dependency. Our experiments show that improbable bigrams are significantly prone to hallucinatory behaviors. Surprisingly, the same phrases have drastically lower rates of hallucination (90% reduction in Llama3.1) when an alternative tokenization is used. We caution against the potential vulnerabilities introduced by byte-level BPE tokenizers, which may introduce blind spots to language models.

Abstract: Clinical decision making (CDM) is a complex, dynamic process crucial to healthcare delivery, yet it remains a significant challenge for artificial intelligence systems. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been tested on general medical knowledge using licensing exams and knowledge question-answering tasks, their performance in the CDM in real-world scenarios is limited due to the lack of comprehensive testing datasets that mirror actual medical practice. To address this gap, we present MedChain, a dataset of 12,163 clinical cases that covers five key stages of clinical workflow. MedChain distinguishes itself from existing benchmarks with three key features of real-world clinical practice: personalization, interactivity, and sequentiality. Further, to tackle real-world CDM challenges, we also propose MedChain-Agent, an AI system that integrates a feedback mechanism and a MCase-RAG module to learn from previous cases and adapt its responses. MedChain-Agent demonstrates remarkable adaptability in gathering information dynamically and handling sequential clinical tasks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with applications in fraud detection, content moderation, and user behavior analysis. However, AD is relatively understudied in a natural language processing (NLP) context, limiting its effectiveness in detecting harmful content, phishing attempts, and spam reviews. We introduce NLP-ADBench, the most comprehensive NLP anomaly detection (NLP-AD) benchmark to date, which includes eight curated datasets and 19 state-of-the-art algorithms. These span 3 end-to-end methods and 16 two-step approaches that adapt classical, non-AD methods to language embeddings from BERT and OpenAI. Our empirical results show that no single model dominates across all datasets, indicating a need for automated model selection. Moreover, two-step methods with transformer-based embeddings consistently outperform specialized end-to-end approaches, with OpenAI embeddings outperforming those of BERT. We release NLP-ADBench at https://github.com/USC-FORTIS/NLP-ADBench, providing a unified framework for NLP-AD and supporting future investigations.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has exhibited promise in utilizing external knowledge, its generation process heavily depends on the quality and accuracy of the retrieved context. Large language models (LLMs) struggle to evaluate the correctness of non-parametric knowledge retrieved externally when it differs from internal memorization, leading to knowledge conflicts during response generation. To this end, we introduce the Retrieval Preference Optimization (RPO), a lightweight and effective alignment method to adaptively leverage multi-source knowledge based on retrieval relevance. An implicit representation of retrieval relevance is derived and incorporated into the reward model to integrate retrieval evaluation and response generation into a single model, solving the problem that previous methods necessitate the additional procedure to assess the retrieval quality. Notably, RPO is the only RAG-dedicated alignment approach that quantifies the awareness of retrieval relevance in training, overcoming mathematical obstacles. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that RPO outperforms RAG by 4-10% in accuracy without any extra component, exhibiting its robust generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) like Mamba have recently attracted much attention. Compared to Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), Mamba achieves linear computation complexity with the sequence length and demonstrates superior performance. However, Mamba is hard to accelerate due to the scattered activation outliers and the complex computation dependency, rendering existing LLM accelerators inefficient. In this paper, we propose LightMamba that co-designs the quantization algorithm and FPGA accelerator architecture for efficient Mamba inference. We first propose an FPGA-friendly post-training quantization algorithm that features rotation-assisted quantization and power-of-two SSM quantization to reduce the majority of computation to 4-bit. We further design an FPGA accelerator that partially unrolls the Mamba computation to balance the efficiency and hardware costs. Through computation reordering as well as fine-grained tiling and fusion, the hardware utilization and memory efficiency of the accelerator get drastically improved. We implement LightMamba on Xilinx Versal VCK190 FPGA and achieve 4.65x to 6.06x higher energy efficiency over the GPU baseline. When evaluated on Alveo U280 FPGA, LightMamba reaches 93 tokens/s, which is 1.43x that of the GPU baseline. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/LightMamba.

Abstract: Data filtering strategies are a crucial component to develop safe Large Language Models (LLM), since they support the removal of harmful contents from pretraining datasets. There is a lack of research on the actual impact of these strategies on vulnerable groups to discrimination, though, and their effectiveness has not been yet systematically addressed. In this paper we present a benchmark study of data filtering strategies for harm reduction aimed at providing a systematic evaluation on these approaches. We provide an overview $55$ technical reports of English LMs and LLMs to identify the existing filtering strategies in literature and implement an experimental setting to test their impact against vulnerable groups. Our results show that the positive impact that strategies have in reducing harmful contents from documents has the side effect of increasing the underrepresentation of vulnerable groups to discrimination in datasets.

Abstract: This study explores how bilingual language models develop complex internal representations. We employ sparse autoencoders to analyze internal representations of bilingual language models with a focus on the effects of training steps, layers, and model sizes. Our analysis shows that language models first learn languages separately, and then gradually form bilingual alignments, particularly in the mid layers. We also found that this bilingual tendency is stronger in larger models. Building on these findings, we demonstrate the critical role of bilingual representations in model performance by employing a novel method that integrates decomposed representations from a fully trained model into a mid-training model. Our results provide insights into how language models acquire bilingual capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their successful application to a broad range of tasks. However, in information-intensive tasks, the prompt length can grow fast, leading to increased computational requirements, performance degradation, and induced biases from irrelevant or redundant information. Recently, various prompt compression techniques have been introduced to optimize the trade-off between reducing input length and retaining performance. We propose a holistic evaluation framework that allows for in-depth analysis of prompt compression methods. We focus on three key aspects, besides compression ratio: (i) downstream task performance, (ii) grounding in the input context, and (iii) information preservation. Using our framework, we analyze state-of-the-art soft and hard compression methods and show that some fail to preserve key details from the original prompt, limiting performance on complex tasks. By identifying these limitations, we are able to improve one soft prompting method by controlling compression granularity, achieving up to +23% in downstream performance, +8 BERTScore points in grounding, and 2.7x more entities preserved in compression. Ultimately, we find that the best effectiveness/compression rate trade-off is achieved with soft prompting combined with sequence-level training.The code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/information-preservation-in-prompt-compression.

<title>RAISE: Reinforced Adaptive Instruction Selection For Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: In the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), it is widely recognized that a few high-quality instructions are superior to a large number of low-quality instructions. At present, many instruction selection methods have been proposed, but most of these methods select instruction based on heuristic quality metrics, and only consider data selection before training. These designs lead to insufficient optimization of instruction fine-tuning, and fixed heuristic indicators are often difficult to optimize for specific tasks. Therefore, we design a dynamic, task-objective-driven instruction selection framework RAISE(Reinforced Adaptive Instruction SElection), which incorporates the entire instruction fine-tuning process into optimization, selecting instructions at each step based on the expected impact of each instruction on model performance improvement. Our approach is well interpretable and has strong task-specific optimization capabilities. By modeling dynamic instruction selection as a sequential decision-making process, we use RL to train our selection strategy. Extensive experiments and result analysis prove the superiority of our method compared with other instruction selection methods. Notably, RAISE achieves superior performance by updating only 1% of the training steps compared to full-data training, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and misinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze claims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, particularly from the authors of those papers, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose \textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling the two sub-tasks and optimizing them with distinct objectives through a collaborative multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in the MC task. The code is available at https://github.com/zh-jia/DDO.

<title>Beyond Demonstrations: Dynamic Vector Construction from Latent Representations</title>

Abstract: In-Context derived Vector (ICV) methods extract task-relevant representations from large language models (LLMs) and reinject them during inference, achieving comparable performance to few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) without repeated demonstration processing. However, existing ICV methods remain sensitive to ICL-specific factors, often use coarse or semantically fragmented representations as the source of the vector, and rely on heuristic-based injection positions, limiting their applicability.
  To address these issues, we propose Dynamic Vector (DyVec), which incorporates an Exhaustive Query Rotation (EQR) strategy to extract robust semantically aggregated latent representations by mitigating variance introduced by ICL. It then applies Dynamic Latent Segmentation and Injection to adaptively partition representations based on task complexity and leverages REINFORCE-based optimization to learn optimal injection positions for each segment.
  Experiments results show that DyVec outperforms few-shot ICL, LoRA, and prior ICV baselines. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of dynamically segmenting and injecting semantically aggregated latent representations. DyVec provides a lightweight and data-efficient solution for inference-time task adaptation.

Abstract: Accurately understanding numbers from financial reports is fundamental to how markets, regulators, algorithms, and normal people read the economy and the world, yet even with XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) designed to tag every figure with standardized accounting concepts, mapping thousands of facts to over 10,000 U.S. GAAP concepts remains costly, inconsistent, and error-prone. Existing benchmarks define tagging as flat, single-step, extreme classification over small subsets of US-GAAP concepts, overlooking both the taxonomy's hierarchical semantics and the structured nature of real tagging, where each fact must be represented as a contextualized multi-field output. These simplifications prevent fair evaluation of large language models (LLMs) under realistic reporting conditions. To address these gaps, we introduce FinTagging, the first comprehensive benchmark for structure-aware and full-scope XBRL tagging, designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to extract and align financial facts through numerical reasoning and taxonomy alignment across text and tables. We define two subtasks: FinNI for numeric identification, which extracts numerical entities and their types from XBRL reports, and FinCL for concept linking, which maps each extracted entity to the corresponding concept in the full US-GAAP taxonomy. Together, these subtasks produce a structured representation of each financial fact. We evaluate diverse LLMs under zero-shot settings and analyze their performance across both subtasks and overall tagging accuracy. Results show that LLMs generalize well in numeric identification but struggle with fine-grained concept linking, revealing current limitations in structure-aware reasoning for accurate financial disclosure. All code and datasets are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I, we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500 rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably, models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical utility of our approach.

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning, ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance. However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE (Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on sycophancy into the video domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. Furthermore, we propose two potential training-free mitigation strategies, revealing potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias: (i) enhancing visual grounding through interpretable key-frame selection and (ii) steering model behavior away from sycophancy via targeted, inference-time intervention on its internal neural representations. Our code is available at https://github.com/William030422/Video-Sycophancy.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer, optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments on five reasoning datasets demonstrate both the efficacy and efficiency of SSA. Notably, SSA improves over naive majority voting by 8% pass@5 on MATH. Furthermore, our 3B SSA surpasses model-based re-ranking with a much larger 72B process reward model. Our analysis also shows promising generalization ability of SSA, across sample set sizes, base model families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

Abstract: We introduce RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that provides the foundation for Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and mitigate their unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety approaches often rely on costly human evaluation or isolated single-model assessment, both constrained by scalability and prone to oversight failures. RedDebate employs collaborative argumentation among multiple LLMs across diverse debate scenarios, enabling them to critically evaluate one another's reasoning and systematically uncover unsafe failure modes through fully automated red-teaming. We further integrate distinct long-term memory modules that preserve safety-relevant insights from debate interactions and leverage them during subsequent inference, facilitating continuous refinement of model behaviour. Empirical evaluation on safety benchmarks across a diverse set of models demonstrates that RedDebate substantially reduces unsafe outputs. While debate alone allows LLMs to refine their behaviour, the addition of memory yields further significant reductions. To the best of our knowledge, RedDebate is the first fully automated framework to unify multi-agent debate and red-teaming to progressively enhance LLM safety without human intervention.

Abstract: Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the language's orthographic complexity. Existing solutions ignore crucial phonetic features such as stress that remain underspecified even when vowel marks are added. To address these limitations, we introduce Phonikud, a lightweight, open-source Hebrew grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) system that outputs fully-specified IPA transcriptions. Our approach adapts an existing diacritization model with lightweight adaptors, incurring negligible additional latency. We also contribute the ILSpeech dataset of transcribed Hebrew speech with IPA annotations, serving as a benchmark for Hebrew G2P, as training data for TTS systems, and enabling audio-to-IPA for evaluating TTS performance while capturing important phonetic details. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at https: //phonikud.github.io.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

<title>Learning to Disentangle Latent Reasoning Rules with Language VAEs: A Systematic Study</title>

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation, interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings - can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into subquadratic architectures. Transformers faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks with long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing Key-Value (KV) cache that makes inference memory-bound by context length. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving model quality. Unlike prior linearization methods constrained by fixed, non-adaptive structures, Lizard augments the architecture with compact, learnable modules that enable adaptive memory control and robust length generalization. Moreover, we introduce a hardwareaware algorithm that solves numerical instability in gated attention to accelerate training. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of its teacher model's performance, significantly outperforming previous methods by up to 9.4 - 24.5 points on the 5-shot MMLU benchmark and demonstrating superior associative recall.

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile, foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text, images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages - phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each stage, our method leverages LLMs' metalinguistic reasoning capabilities, injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring consistency and typological diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs without human linguistic expertise.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM. We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures, and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering; 2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.The code of LaTeXTrans is available at https://github.com/NiuTrans/LaTeXTrans.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as evaluators of text quality, yet the validity of their judgments remains underexplored. This study investigates systematic bias in self- and cross-model evaluations across three prominent LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. We designed a controlled experiment in which blog posts authored by each model were evaluated by all three models under four labeling conditions: no attribution, true attribution, and two false-attribution scenarios. Evaluations employed both holistic preference voting and granular quality ratings across three dimensions Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness with all scores normalized to percentages for direct comparison. Our findings reveal pronounced asymmetries in model judgments: the "Claude" label consistently elevated scores regardless of actual authorship, while the "Gemini" label systematically depressed them. False attribution frequently reversed preference rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in voting outcomes and up to 12 percentage points in quality ratings. Notably, Gemini exhibited severe self-deprecation under true labels, while Claude demonstrated intensified self-preference. These results demonstrate that perceived model identity can substantially distort both high-level judgments and fine-grained quality assessments, independent of content quality. Our findings challenge the reliability of LLM-as-judge paradigms and underscore the critical need for blind evaluation protocols and diverse multi-model validation frameworks to ensure fairness and validity in automated text evaluation and LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can achieve a certain level of proficiency in multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/THUDM/LLM4CardGame

Abstract: Making large language models (LLMs) more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a promising technique, but existing pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can cause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and latency.

Abstract: Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering: prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by manipulating the interpretable latent space.

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.

Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of HealthBench, a large-scale, rubric-based medical benchmark, to the Japanese context. Although robust evaluation frameworks are essential for the safe development of medical LLMs, resources in Japanese are scarce and often consist of translated multiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this issue in two ways. First, we establish a performance baseline by applying a machine-translated version of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate two models: a high-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source model (LLM-jp-3.1). Secondly, we use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach to systematically classify the benchmark's scenarios and rubric criteria. This allows us to identify 'contextual gaps' where the content is misaligned with Japan's clinical guidelines, healthcare systems or cultural norms. Our findings reveal a modest performance drop in GPT-4.1 due to rubric mismatches, as well as a significant failure in the Japanese-native model, which lacked the required clinical completeness. Furthermore, our classification shows that, despite most scenarios being applicable, a significant proportion of the rubric criteria require localisation. This work underscores the limitations of direct benchmark translation and highlights the urgent need for a context-aware, localised adaptation, a "J-HealthBench", to ensure the reliable and safe evaluation of medical LLMs in Japan.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components -- CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge, numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/NREL-Theseus/cfdllmbench/.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search. Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

<title>Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity</title>

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a signal of jailbreak intention.

<title>Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM-based Fusion</title>

Abstract: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

Abstract: Although recent quantized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet, have paved the way for significant reduction in memory usage during deployment with binary or ternary weights, training these models still demands substantial memory footprints. This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weights required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore directly updating the quantized low-precision weights without relying on straight-through estimation during backpropagation, aiming to save memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize the information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models of various sizes indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values; (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits achieves performance on par with BitNet b1.58; (3) our models remain robust to precision scaling and memory reduction, showing minimal performance degradation when moving from FP32 to lower-memory environments (BF16/FP8); and (4) our models also support inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach for training o1-like RAG models that retrieve and reason over relevant information step by step before generating the final answer. Conventional RAG methods usually perform a single retrieval step before the generation process, which limits their effectiveness in addressing complex queries due to imperfect retrieval results. In contrast, our proposed method, CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation), allows the model to dynamically reformulate the query based on the evolving state. To train CoRAG effectively, we utilize rejection sampling to automatically generate intermediate retrieval chains, thereby augmenting existing RAG datasets that only provide the correct final answer. At test time, we propose various decoding strategies to scale the model's test-time compute by controlling the length and number of sampled retrieval chains. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks validate the efficacy of CoRAG, particularly in multi-hop question answering tasks, where we observe more than 10 points improvement in EM score compared to strong baselines. On the KILT benchmark, CoRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of knowledge-intensive tasks. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive analyses to understand the scaling behavior of CoRAG, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at developing factual and grounded foundation models.

<title>Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Iterative Code Graph Searching</title>

Abstract: Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.

<title>An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However, accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand, human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. On the other hand, many automatic evaluation metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual correctness of generated software artifacts.
  In this paper, we present SE-Jury, the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SE-Jury first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented by an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mechanism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges as a team to produce a final correctness score through ensembling. We evaluate SE-Jury across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks that span three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Results demonstrate that SE-Jury consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging from 29.6% to 140.8% over existing automatic metrics. SE-Jury reaches agreement levels with human annotators that are close to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program repair. These findings underscore SE-Jury's potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human evaluation in these SE tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability. Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks: causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning abilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end (M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce \textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory (STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13 pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/Mem4Nav.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, exposing gradients during training can leak sensitive information about the underlying data, raising privacy and security concerns such as susceptibility to data poisoning attacks. In contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. This paper introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide non-vacuous generalization bounds and strong theoretical guarantees for differential privacy, robustness to data poisoning attacks, and extraction attacks. In experiments with LLMs, we demonstrate empirically that black-box optimization methods-despite the scalability and computational challenges inherent to black-box approaches-are able to learn, showing how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance, generalize well on a benchmark of reasoning datasets, and are robust to membership inference attacks. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on on top of gradient-based optimization, offering suitability for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments while also providing non-vacuous generalization guarantees.

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved relevant biomolecular information, including FASTA sequences, SMILES representations, and literature, and answered mechanistic questions with improved contextual accuracy compared to standard LLMs. It then generated chemically diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55. The number of molecules satisfying empirical drug-likeness filters also rose; for example, compliance with the Ghose filter increased from 32 to 55 within a pool of 100 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models, providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are inaccurate on web content, because web content has low positive rates, complex markup, and diverse genres, instead of clean, prose-like benchmark data SoTA detectors are optimized for.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple prose-like pages to boost accuracies. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web ecosystem.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term tactical decisions consistent with long-term financial objectives. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been applied to such problems, but adoption is limited by myopic behaviour and opaque policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts.
  This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).
  Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.

Abstract: The effective training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for function calling faces a critical challenge: balancing exploration of complex reasoning paths with stable policy optimization. Standard methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fail to instill robust reasoning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with inefficient exploration. We propose \textbf{EGPO}, a new RL framework built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), designed to address this challenge directly. The core of EGPO is an entropy-enhanced advantage function that integrates the entropy of the model's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the policy gradient computation. This encourages the generation of diverse reasoning strategies. To maintain optimization direction, the entropy bonus is carefully constrained by a clipping mechanism. Complemented by a strict, binary reward signal, EGPO effectively guides the model towards discovering structured and accurate tool invocation patterns. On the challenging Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), a 4B-parameter model trained with EGPO sets a new state-of-the-art among models of comparable size, surpassing a range of strong competitors, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically fine-tuned for reasoning tasks through a two-stage pipeline of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a process fraught with catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal trade-offs between imitation and exploration. Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on prompt concatenation rather than genuine refinement through structured discussions. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Anemoi.

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment. In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images, thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in social media.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of hallucinations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and the need for detecting hallucinated spans in a multi-step decision-making process. The authors propose a reinforcement learning framework called RL4HS, which incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and span-level rewards to improve the accuracy of identifying hallucination spans. Through experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark, including tasks such as summarization, question answering, and data-to-text, the study demonstrates that RL4HS outperforms pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning. The results highlight the importance of explicit reasoning and reinforcement learning with span-level rewards in accurately detecting hallucination spans and improving reliability in natural language processing applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

<br />
Summary: 
The paper discusses Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a method to enhance reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Current methods rely on self-exploration or a single teacher model, limiting reasoning diversity and performance. The authors propose Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), which uses multiple teacher models to guide the on-policy model only when needed. This approach allows for expanded exploration while maintaining self-discovery value. The selection mechanism prompts the student model to learn from reasoning paths it is likely to comprehend, balancing exploration and exploitation. Experimental results show that AMPO outperforms a strong baseline method on mathematical reasoning tasks and out-of-distribution tasks, improving Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. By utilizing multiple peer-sized teachers, AMPO achieves comparable results to methods using a single, more powerful teacher model, showcasing its efficiency and scalability in enhancing reasoning and generalizability. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.

Summary:<br /><br />The study explores the impact of social media on urban sentiment analysis, using innovative methodologies to measure perception and opinion in Beijing. By analyzing images and text posts from platforms like Baidu, Tencent Street view, and Weibo, the study detects sentiment inconsistencies and trends in sentiment reactions. It identifies disparities between human perception and opinion sentiments, highlighting changes in sentiment in urban areas before and after the pandemic. The analysis shows a shift towards more evenly distributed positive sentiment in perception reactions, while opinion reactions exhibit more extreme changes. The study also reveals significant relationships between sentiment reactions and elements like dense buildings and pedestrian presence. These findings provide valuable insights for environmental management strategies and urban renewal efforts. <div>

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in formulating strategies for urban renewal.

<div> retrieval strategies, long-context models, HaystackCraft benchmark, agentic operations, distractors <br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of current synthetic benchmarks for evaluating long-context large language models (LLMs) and proposes the need for "haystack engineering" to create more realistic noisy contexts. The authors introduce HaystackCraft, a new benchmark based on the English Wikipedia hyperlink network, to evaluate how different retrieval strategies impact distractors and LLM performance. They find that dense retrievers can introduce challenging distractors, but graph-based reranking can improve retrieval effectiveness. In agentic tests, even advanced models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 struggle with self-generated distractors and early stops. These findings underscore the ongoing challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and position HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future research in this area. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic "needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models' long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies (e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition, haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1) while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors, graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

Summary:
- Lemmatization is the process of transforming words in a text into their dictionary forms.
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown competitive performance in various NLP tasks but their effectiveness in in-context lemmatization was not known.
- This study compares LLMs to traditional supervised approaches for lemmatization when training data is not available for a specific domain or language.
- Experimentation across 12 languages with different morphological complexities found that LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating lemmas in context without prior fine-tuning, with just a few examples.
- The findings suggest that current LLMs have the potential to excel in in-context lemmatization tasks without extensive fine-tuning, offering a promising approach for languages and domains with limited training data.

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied with close to 89% accuracy.

- Leveraging the Global Populism Database, this approach prompts a language model with documentation to guide reasoning.

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced, context sensitive aspects of populism.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS) can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks, MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework for efficient Test-time scaling (TTS) in Large Language Models (LLM). It addresses the issue of memory-bound bottleneck during LLM decoding by predicting the next-token query state using a light-weight temporal-regressive module. AsyncSpade also employs an asynchronous and disaggregated framework to overlap token-level KV selection with forward inference computation, eliminating sequential dependence without compromising model performance. This approach leads to a significant reduction in time-per-output-token (TPOT), outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline (Quest) by over 20% and full attention models by at least 50% on various TTS benchmarks such as AIME, GPQA-Diamond, and MATH-500. AsyncSpade achieves optimal efficiency on common LLM serving setups, showcasing improved serving efficiency and model performance under high concurrency and long-chain-of-thought scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2510.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT), but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection, hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

Our results show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited conversational coordination.

<div> Keywords: speech LLMs, reasoning tasks, chain-of-thought prompting, latency, Direct Preference Optimization

Summary: 
This study explores the impact of chain-of-thought fine-tuning on multi-stream speech large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks. Results show a 2.4x increase in accuracy across various spoken reasoning tasks. To address latency in spoken responses, a method based on "question completeness" is introduced, allowing models to start reasoning before query completion. This method offers better accuracy-latency trade-off control and a 4% accuracy gain on ARC-Easy under equivalent latency conditions. Using Direct Preference Optimization on preference data, a 70% latency reduction without accuracy loss is achieved, pushing the accuracy-latency pareto frontier. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CoT fine-tuning and latency reduction strategies in enhancing the performance of speech LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Long-Context Language Models, multi-hop reasoning, thought templates, natural-language feedback, knowledge-intensive 

Summary: 
The article introduces Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL) as a framework to improve multi-hop reasoning in Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs). By using thought templates derived from prior problem-solving traces, ToTAL helps structure how evidence is combined and guides inference with factual documents effectively. An update strategy refines these templates through natural-language feedback, leading to consistent performance gains over strong baselines in both retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. ToTAL demonstrates its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse by distilling optimized templates into smaller open-source models. This approach enhances the integration of large sets of documents in LCLMs, enabling more efficient and accurate multi-hop reasoning processes. <div>

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However, simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models, demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

<div> Keywords: Persian language, digraphic, transliteration, sequence-to-sequence model, benchmark

Summary:
A new study explores the challenges of written communication between Tajikistan and Persian-speaking countries due to script differences. Existing machine transliteration models were limited by domain-specific datasets, hindering real-world usage. The researchers present a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi transliteration trained on diverse datasets to improve versatility. Results show high accuracy scores in both directions, setting leading benchmarks. The model achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik, and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi, respectively. The data, code, and model are available for further research and development at a specified link. The study's findings highlight the importance of comprehensive datasets and model training for effective transliteration systems in digraphic languages. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards: Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains, meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage. The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty. We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

<div> speculative decoding, language models, long-context benchmark, LSTM-based drafter, hybrid algorithm

Summary:
OWL is a novel model designed to address the limitations of existing methods for faster inference in large language models (LLMs) with long contexts. The model achieves higher acceptance length than previous methods by utilizing an LSTM-based drafter conditioned on the last-token state, incorporating a special token [SPEC] for richer representation, and implementing a hybrid algorithm for decoding. Current approaches, such as EAGLE3, perform poorly with long contexts, with EAGLE3 even slowing down the generation speed. In contrast, OWL demonstrates improved performance and generalization capabilities, offering a promising solution for efficient inference in real-world settings. The release of the LongSpecBench benchmark, along with the code and datasets, aims to advance future research in this field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models (LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings. Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all code and datasets to advance future research.

<div> LVLMs, chart comprehension, tiny models, multi-criteria prompting, domain-adaptive transfer learning <br />
Summary: <br />
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in chart comprehension tasks, but tiny models with <=2B parameters perform poorly. To address this, two approaches are proposed: multi-criteria prompting and domain-adaptive transfer learning. Multi-criteria prompting combines evaluation criteria into a single query, while domain-adaptive transfer learning fine-tunes a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic judgments to create the specialized ChartJudge. Experiments reveal robustness gaps in 7B models with multi-criteria prompting and demonstrate ChartJudge's ability to transfer knowledge between datasets. The analysis highlights trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and transferability, enabling cost-efficient evaluation for chart reasoning tasks. The code and data will be publicly available. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models (<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic. In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

Summary: 
This study investigates strategies to improve the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for named entity recognition (NER) and text classification tasks on mobile platforms. It is found that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning can lead to conflicting optimization signals, reducing overall performance. To address this issue, a multi-task pre-finetuning framework using task-primary LoRA modules is proposed, enabling a single shared encoder backbone with modular adapters. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of +0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification. The proposed approach allows for enhanced adaptability of NLP models while meeting deployment constraints, making it suitable for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of +0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Summary: 
This study examines pandemic-related online discourse to distinguish between health misinformation and factual communication. By analyzing three corpora on COVID-19 false narratives, general COVID-19 content, and Monkeypox-related posts, the study identifies differences in readability, rhetorical markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation shows lower readability scores, higher frequency of fear-related and persuasive terms, and minimal use of exclamation marks compared to other datasets. The deliberate complexity of rhetorical style combined with emotional cues in misinformation may enhance perceived credibility. These findings contribute to detecting digital health misinformation, informing public health messaging strategies, and enhancing crisis communication models in networked media environments. However, the study acknowledges limitations and suggests future research directions to strengthen robustness. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives (n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts (n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs, broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen robustness.

<div> constructed languages, LLMs, phonology, morphosyntactic markup, lexicon

Summary:
The article presents a system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) in the development of constructed languages. The system follows a modular approach, starting with creating a target phonology for the language using feedback mechanisms. It then translates sentences into a morphosyntactic markup reflecting the desired language's specifications and constructs a lexicon based on the translated corpus. The system also generates an orthography for the language and writes a grammatical handbook. The goal of the system is to provide a fun tool for creating artificial languages and to explore LLMs' understanding of linguistic concepts. The capabilities of LLMs vary depending on the linguistic specifications, with common patterns being easier to handle than rarer ones. The system's application in translating from high-resource to low-resource languages shows potential for improvement despite current limitations. The research aims to enhance language creation tools and improve translation tasks between different language resources. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could afford some real gains in such tasks.

<div> Keyword: language models, input embeddings, geometric structure, training, vocabulary representations

Summary:
During training, the geometry of vocabulary embeddings in large language models quickly aligns with semantic and syntactic features, showing a convergence towards linguistic structure. High-frequency and function words reach their final embeddings faster than low-frequency words, retaining some bias from random initialization. Understanding the evolution of vocabulary geometry during training provides insights into how language models acquire specific capabilities and the roles of word frequency and function in shaping input representations. This study sheds light on the dynamic trajectory of vocabulary organization in language models, highlighting the importance of structural alignment with linguistic features for effective model performance.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic, and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features; 2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model training.

<br /><br />Summary: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare, but off-the-shelf LLMs face challenges with hierarchical misalignments. Lightweight interventions like prompt engineering and fine-tuning can enhance accuracy without additional computational costs. A new approach, clinical code verification, is introduced to improve error detection for hierarchically close but incorrect code predictions. To address data limitations and biases, an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10 codes is released, highlighting the importance of verification in enhancing LLM-based medical coding reliability. <div>

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing, and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10 codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Summary:
Access control is essential for secure computing, but large language models often struggle to adhere to role boundaries, leading to unrestricted responses. This study focuses on role-conditioned refusals in language models, particularly their ability to follow access control policies. A new dataset, incorporating realistic PostgreSQL role-based policies, was created and used to evaluate different model designs. Comparisons were made between zero or few-shot prompting, a two-step generator-verifier pipeline, and LoRA fine-tuned models. The results showed that explicit verification through the two-step framework improved refusal precision and reduced false permits, while fine-tuning achieved a better balance between safety and utility. However, longer and more complex policies posed challenges for all systems. The researchers released RBAC-augmented datasets and code for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: Access control is crucial for secure computing, but large language models often blur role boundaries, leading to unrestricted responses. Role-conditioned refusals were studied using a novel dataset with realistic PostgreSQL role-based policies.

arXiv:2510.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems. We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Ryt AI is an agentic framework developed for Ryt Bank that allows customers to perform core financial transactions through natural language conversation. It is the first globally regulator-approved deployment where conversational AI serves as the primary banking interface, rather than in advisory roles. Ryt AI utilizes ILMU, a closed-source LLM, and four LLM-powered agents to streamline banking processes into a single dialogue. The framework includes LoRA adapters for task-specific functions and is hosted within the bank's infrastructure for consistency. Security measures like deterministic guardrails, human-in-the-loop confirmation, and stateless audit architecture ensure protection and compliance. This innovative approach showcases a successful integration of natural language interfaces to support essential financial activities while upholding strict regulation.

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents (Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails, human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right: demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably support core financial operations under strict governance.

<br />
Summary:
The article introduces the Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache) framework for efficiently managing memory overhead in Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows. OBCache formulates cache eviction as a structured pruning problem based on token saliency, quantifying the impact of pruning tokens on attention outputs. This approach considers not only attention weights but also information from value states and attention outputs, enhancing existing eviction strategies with output-aware signals. The framework's closed-form scores, derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs, provide a more principled approach to token ranking compared to heuristic methods. Experimental results on LLaMA and Qwen models show that utilizing OBCache's output-aware scores improves long-context accuracy by replacing heuristic scores that estimate token saliency across different query positions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size. Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity, yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs. Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<div> Keywords: social bias, language models, token probability metrics, natural language inference, bias evaluation

Summary: 
This study explores the measurement of social bias in language models using natural language inference (NLI) as an alternative bias metric to token probability (TP) metrics. The research reveals that NLI and TP bias evaluations exhibit significant differences, with low correlation between various NLI metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. NLI metrics are more effective at identifying "underdebiasing" instances, but they are also more susceptible to variations in the wording of counterstereotypical sentences. The study suggests that a combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations is necessary for a comprehensive assessment of language models. Additionally, this work cautions that neither TP nor NLI can be considered a superior bias metric in all scenarios, highlighting the importance of utilizing multiple evaluation methods in tandem. <div>

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive evaluation of language models.

Summary:
The study introduces a methodology for systematically stress-testing model character specifications of large language models (LLMs). It identifies conflicts and ambiguities in current model specs by generating scenarios that force tradeoffs between competing principles. Twelve frontier LLMs from major providers are evaluated, revealing over 70,000 cases of significant behavioral divergence. This divergence predicts underlying issues in model specifications, such as direct contradiction and interpretive ambiguities. The generated dataset showcases misalignment cases and false-positive refusals across all models. Value prioritization patterns and model differences are also provided. The research emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and analysis to address challenges in LLM model specifications, highlighting the need for clearer and more consistent ethical guidelines to guide the development and deployment of AI systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence. Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally, our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent, predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles, for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation, perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges in detecting online hate speech, particularly implicit hate that is conveyed through sarcasm, irony, stereotypes, or coded language. Existing models struggle to generalize across different styles and platforms, leading to spurious correlations between speech and labels. The authors introduce CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into key factors such as contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style. By controlling confounders and allowing for counterfactual reasoning, CADET effectively identifies hate speech in various forms. Through experiments, CADET demonstrates superior performance, showcasing the potential of using causal priors to advance generalizable hate speech detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony, stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations. Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches. Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders, thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues. Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

<div> deeply personalized generation, user textual history, hierarchical memory, temporal evolution, semantic relationships

Summary:
MemWeaver is a framework that integrates a user's entire textual history into a hierarchical memory to enable deeply personalized generation. It addresses the limitations of existing approaches by capturing both the temporal evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different activities. The framework consists of two memory components - behavioral memory and cognitive memory - which represent specific user actions and long-term preferences, respectively. This dual-component memory allows large language models to reason over both concrete behaviors and abstracted traits, enhancing the personalization process. Experiments conducted on the Language Model Personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MemWeaver in generating personalized content. The code for MemWeaver is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose \textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences. This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user, allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

Summary:<br />
- The article introduces SubQRAG, a framework that enhances multi-hop question answering by decomposing complex questions into verifiable sub-questions.
- SubQRAG retrieves relevant triples from a knowledge graph and dynamically expands it with new triples from source documents in real time when needed.
- All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory" for structured evidence.
- Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that SubQRAG consistently improves Exact Match scores.
<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus. However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

The framework consists of two components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative Entity Reranking (IER). By efficiently modeling shared knowledge and enhancing its utilization, the framework achieves significant improvements in Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of 5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics, respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on https://github.com/gaoxiaofei07/KL-GMoE.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces ToolExpander, a framework designed to enhance the performance of resource-constrained Large Language Models (LLMs) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). ToolExpander addresses the challenge of inaccurate responses and mid-training collapse in small-scale LLMs. It incorporates Dynamic Multi-Round Hard Sampling to replace challenging samples with high-quality few-shot demonstrations and an exponential learning rate decay strategy to improve stability. The framework also introduces Self-Exemplifying Thinking, eliminating KL divergence and incorporating adjusted clipping coefficients to encourage LLMs to generate and analyze few-shot examples with a minimal additional reward. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities, especially in weaker LLMs, leading to improved training stability and overall performance. <div>
arXiv:2510.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander, a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training stability and overall performance.

The article introduces OpenRubrics, a large dataset of prompt-rubric pairs for training rubric-based reward models in reinforcement learning from human feedback. The Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG) method is proposed to create discriminative evaluation signals by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. By enforcing preference-label consistency through rejection sampling, noisy rubrics are removed to improve reliability. The Rubric-RM model outperforms strong baselines by 6.8% on reward-modeling benchmarks, with gains transferring to policy models on various tasks. The study demonstrates that rubrics offer scalable alignment signals that bridge the gap between manual human evaluation and automated reward modeling, establishing a new approach for language model alignment. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences. Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality. However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Summary: <br />
Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is crucial for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by sampling multiple token-based chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes. This study focuses on applying parallel TTS to latent reasoning models, addressing challenges such as sampling in continuous space and trajectory aggregation. The authors introduce two stochastic sampling strategies, Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise, which scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct exploration dynamics. Additionally, they propose the Latent Reward Model (LatentRM), trained with a step-wise contrastive objective, to score and guide latent reasoning trajectories. Experimental results and visualization analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the sampling strategies and the LatentRM for enhancing latent reasoning models. By enabling scalable inference in continuous spaces, this work opens up new directions for advancing latent reasoning models. <div>
arXiv:2510.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for advanced trajectory aggregation. \
This work enables parallel TTS for latent reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM) trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection. Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are now able to provide reasoning before answering multiple-choice questions, excelling in this task. Concerns have been raised that LLMs may not be solving MCQs as intended, as some studies have shown success without using the question, known as choices-only. Through analyzing reasoning traces, it was found that LLMs use strategies that are not necessarily shallow in choices-only settings. While test-time reasoning can improve accuracy in both full and choices-only inputs, choices-only success is not greatly affected by the length of reasoning traces. The study also showed that the strategies used by LLMs in the choices-only setting are less problematic, such as inferring missing questions. This challenges the notion that partial-input success is always a flaw and highlights the importance of understanding reasoning traces to differentiate between problematic and less problematic reasoning strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have shown improved performance on complex reasoning tasks. However, the lack of domain-specific tools poses a challenge to widespread adoption of this tool-augmented reasoning approach, especially in fields like physics question answering. Automating tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traces is a promising solution, but scalability issues arise as the number of generated tools grows. To address this, a systematic approach is proposed to automatically refactor an unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. This system generates discrete, task-specific tools, clusters them into semantically coherent topics, and uses a multi-agent framework to consolidate functionalities and create versatile, aggregated tools. Experimental results demonstrate improved tool retrieval accuracy, reasoning performance, and scalability compared to baseline methods. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific increases.

<div> reward, mathematical reasoning, model, Miracle Steps, reinforcement learning

Summary:
In this study, large language models for mathematical reasoning were found to be prone to reward hacking, leading to an overestimation of their reasoning abilities. The researchers identified a high incidence of false positives, particularly the occurrence of Miracle Steps where models provide correct answers without valid reasoning. This issue was linked to memorization rather than deduction. To address this, a Rubric Reward Model (RRM) was introduced, which evaluates the entire reasoning process against problem-specific rubrics. By integrating RRM into a reinforcement learning pipeline, the researchers saw improved performance across four math benchmarks, with a significant reduction in Miracle Steps. The study highlights the importance of rewarding the solution process in training mathematical reasoning models for improved accuracy and reliability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

<div> disentanglement, refusal behavior, safety alignment, hallucination, factual accuracy
Summary:
The article discusses the trade-off between truthfulness and safety in large language models (LLMs) concerning hallucination. While progress has been made in detecting and mitigating hallucination to improve factual accuracy, this can inadvertently weaken refusal behavior, crucial for safety alignment. The analysis reveals that overlapping components in the models encoding both hallucination and refusal information lead to unintended suppression of factual knowledge. Even fine-tuning on curated datasets can degrade safety alignment. To address this, a method using sparse autoencoders to disentangle refusal-related features from hallucination features and preserve refusal behavior during fine-tuning is proposed. Evaluation on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks demonstrates that this approach successfully maintains safety alignment and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems, aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations, leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner, which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set) instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance. Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenge of context drift in multi-turn interactions for Large Language Models (LLMs). Context drift refers to the gradual divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns. The study proposes a dynamical framework to interpret context drift, formalizing it as the turn-wise KL divergence between the model's predictions and a reference model. The experiments show that context drift can reach stable equilibria with noise limitations, and simple reminder interventions can reduce divergence as predicted by the theoretical framework. This suggests that context drift in multi-turn interactions can be understood as a controllable equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay. The research provides a foundation for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns. Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench, measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators. Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together, these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

<title>RCPU: Rotation-Constrained Error Compensation for Structured Pruning of a Large Language Model</title>

<div> Keywords: rotation-constrained compensation, structured pruning, large language models, least-squares fitting, variance-aware importance score<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a rotation-constrained compensation method to address errors in structured pruning of large language models (LLMs). LLMs trained on vast datasets contain rich semantic knowledge, while pruning is done with limited calibration data, leading to output mismatches. The proposed method updates pruned parameters under a rotation constraint to maintain output representation geometry and realign the pruned subspace with original outputs. A variance-aware importance score prioritizes retaining dimensions with large variance to preserve important components in the pruned model. Experiments on LLaMA-7B and benchmark datasets show improved perplexity and task accuracy compared to existing methods. <div>
arXiv:2510.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs. Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.

<div> Keywords: Agentic RAG, Hierarchical Process Rewards, RL training, search efficiency, reasoning process 

Summary:
Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG) introduces a fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into RL training to address suboptimal search behaviors in LLMs. By evaluating the necessity of each search decision in real-time and applying a hierarchical reward function, HiPRAG improves search efficiency and reduces over-search and under-search rates. Experimental results on diverse QA benchmarks show increased accuracies while optimizing the reasoning process itself. The method demonstrates good generalizability across various RL algorithms, model families, sizes, and types. This work highlights the significance of fine-grained control in RL for enhancing the efficiency and optimality of reasoning for search agents. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering. However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search (retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3% and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes, and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning for search agents.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework called Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD) to optimize communication topologies for multi-agent systems driven by large language models. GTD utilizes a lightweight proxy model to predict multi-objective rewards and guide the iterative topology synthesis process. This approach enables real-time, gradient-free optimization towards task-adaptive topologies, addressing the challenges of balancing task performance, communication cost, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate GTD's ability to generate highly efficient and task-adaptive communication topologies, outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration. <div>
arXiv:2510.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness. Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g., accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Multilingual Generative Retrieval via Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC) addresses challenges in applying generative retrieval to multilingual scenarios by unifying semantically equivalent multilingual keywords, aligning semantics, and compressing the identifier space. The framework employs a dynamic multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval, enhancing cross-lingual alignment and decoding efficiency. Experimental results on mMarco100k and mNQ320k datasets show that MGR-CSC significantly improves retrieval accuracy by 6.83% and 4.77% respectively, while reducing document identifier length by 74.51% and 78.2%.

To address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by 74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

This approach maintains consistency and supervision quality simultaneously.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation (MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs.

arXiv:2510.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs' thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled overthinking management.

Through experiments on mainstream models, a relative performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and misunderstandings in open-ended conversations were observed. The proposed approach, utilizing the Chain of Recognition (CoR) and Keyword Highlighting (KH) methods, significantly improved language alignment capabilities, leading to a substantial improvement in knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%. The open-ended understanding rate also increased from 64.5% to 86.5%, with a reduction in pronunciation errors in the secondary language.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark (CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation errors in the secondary language.

- The robustness and generalization of Weak-to-Strong generalization are limited by noise and biases in weak-model outputs.
- Implicit rewards, approximating explicit rewards through log-likelihood ratios, are utilized to improve Weak-to-Strong generalization.
- Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG) framework is proposed, which employs contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality samples.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling. However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising, and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway toward AGI.

The study explores cross-dialectal transfer from standard to non-standard German dialects using text and speech data. Three settings are compared: text models, speech models, and cascaded systems combining speech and text processing. A new dialectal audio intent classification dataset for German is introduced. Results show that speech-only setup performs best on dialect data, while the text-only setup is more effective for standard German. Cascaded systems yield promising results on dialectal data when utilizing normalized transcriptions. The study highlights the significance of considering spoken dialects in natural language processing tasks and suggests the use of appropriate systems for optimal performance in transfer learning scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like output.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective, deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution, including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

<title>ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual Recall</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight, we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning mechanisms.

<title>Towards Human-Like Grading: A Unified LLM-Enhanced Framework for Subjective Question Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07912</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1) compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers, (2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce enterprise.

<title>STEPER: Step-wise Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step Retrieval-Augmented Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07923</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses. However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions. Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B teacher model.

arXiv:2510.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains, such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference (NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&amp;A-based approach that extracts question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when answering user queries based on multiple sources.

<title>Vision-Enabled LLMs in Historical Lexicography: Digitising and Enriching Estonian-German Dictionaries from the 17th and 18th Centuries</title>

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models (LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648 dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context, Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81% of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732 dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for saving time and financial resources.

<title>A$^2$Search: Ambiguity-Aware Question Answering with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA). However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals. Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation, which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue. In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$ score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$). Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems.

arXiv:2510.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning.

<title>Active Confusion Expression in Large Language Models: Leveraging World Models toward Better Social Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07974</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning, we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused" when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this, we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset. Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering, category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4 reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\% gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and stylistically faithful to the source paper.

<title>Learning on the Job: An Experience-Driven Self-Evolving Agent for Long-Horizon Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations, we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly, ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption, the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However, spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes. Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and complements existing climate communication assessments.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability, conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models (ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text, multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model, FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of dialogue generation.

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by (im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's beliefs.

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400 %. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language consistency between their reasoning and final output.

<title>Lossless Vocabulary Reduction for Auto-Regressive Language Models</title>

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application, we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over 10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references (20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid legal foundation.

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms: 1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents. Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end, we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

<title>DACIP-RC: Domain Adaptive Continual Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension on Business Conversations</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets for domain adaptation.

<title>Beyond Over-Refusal: Scenario-Based Diagnostics and Post-Hoc Mitigation for Exaggerated Refusals in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals, highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking'' problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific, lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis, Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens of metrical poetry.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO), a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples, Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.

<title>Memory Retrieval and Consolidation in Large Language Models through Function Tokens</title>

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens (usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select the most predictive features from context.

<title>LLMs Learn to Deceive Unintentionally: Emergent Misalignment in Dishonesty from Misaligned Samples to Biased Human-AI Interactions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty. Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced understanding and research innovations.

<title>Investigating Counterclaims in Causality Extraction from Text</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on "procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal" claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively distinguish pro- and concausality.

<title>The Alignment Waltz: Jointly Training Agents to Collaborate for Safety</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08240</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content, and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets, demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular, we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic capabilities.

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons. These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at https://github.com/ynklab/CULNIG

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation, and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets -- AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs. AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

<title>Two-Stage Voting for Robust and Efficient Suicide Risk Detection on Social Media</title>

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models (LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets - explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7% on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while significantly lowering LLM cost.

Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets (representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set (representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

<title>If Probable, Then Acceptable? Understanding Conditional Acceptability Judgments in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent $B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the $\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align more closely with human judgments.

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$ is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2 (124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

<title>ARES: Multimodal Adaptive Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Token-Level Entropy Shaping</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks. However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES, a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii) reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems under significantly lower inference costs.

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators. Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

<title>DeepPrune: Parallel Scaling without Inter-trace Redundancy</title>

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient. Our code and data are here: https://deepprune.github.io/

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery, incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation: we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a constrained computation budget.

<title>Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV) cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model (LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining. Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning (RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher, a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment, and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation models.

<title>AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors</title>

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone, formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and self-representation is visual-silent ($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology, and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable user-specific attractors and a self-policy $\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\ A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer, $\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the highest intelligent good.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development, leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder, which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch, reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup, our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture, parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on 17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path to stronger LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII) from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference. Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further, different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families: divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy, offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example, vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks. Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

<title>Test-Time Matching: Unlocking Compositional Reasoning in Multimodal Models</title>

arXiv:2510.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative, self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16 dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of compositional reasoning.

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning, causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial performance in live, interactive settings.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions: (1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans. Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75, 55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual property protection in retrieval-augmented AI systems.

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS, a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition, they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

<title>From Keywords to Clusters: AI-Driven Analysis of YouTube Comments to Reveal Election Issue Salience in 2024</title>

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters' choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November 5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

<title>MetaDefense: Defending Finetuning-based Jailbreak Attack Before and During Generation</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii) mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

<title>Self-Improving LLM Agents at Test-Time</title>

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice, gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and (iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward self-evolution.

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy, and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks. However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data, two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten African accents with the Whisper tiny model.

<title>TaoSR-AGRL: Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning Framework for E-commerce Search Relevance</title>

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.

<title>AutoQual: An LLM Agent for Automated Discovery of Interpretable Features for Review Quality Assessment</title>

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept, making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit, computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by 0.27%.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation. Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states. During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34 versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models (LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems, understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment. This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs, examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making. The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence. Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a strong baseline for future work.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams, we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality, highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e., perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method. Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples. Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which significantly outperforms existing text embedding models. We will fully open-source our created resources in ReasonEmbed to push forward the research advancement in this field.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players' learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma). Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes; and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<title>FlyLoRA: Boosting Task Decoupling and Parameter Efficiency via Implicit Rank-Wise Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference, resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned, cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3) auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision, favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words. While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability and performance even under severe constraints.

<title>The Visual Iconicity Challenge: Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Sign Language Form-Meaning Mapping</title>

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the \textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$ state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines; and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}. Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

<title>To Sink or Not to Sink: Visual Information Pathways in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end -- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/InternAgent.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small, randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich, task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis, which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques.

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization, single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm) pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4) unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), excel in natural language understanding, but their capability for complex mathematical reasoning with an amalgamation of structured tables and unstructured text is uncertain. This study explores LLMs' mathematical reasoning on four financial tabular question-answering datasets: TATQA, FinQA, ConvFinQA, and Multihiertt. Through extensive experiments with various models and prompting techniques, we assess how LLMs adapt to complex tables and mathematical tasks. We focus on sensitivity to table complexity and performance variations with an increasing number of arithmetic reasoning steps. The results provide insights into LLMs' capabilities and limitations in handling complex mathematical scenarios for semi-structured tables. Ultimately, we introduce a novel prompting technique tailored to semi-structured documents, matching or outperforming other baselines in performance while providing a nuanced understanding of LLMs abilities for such a task.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, they often exhibit suboptimal behaviors and inconsistencies when exposed to unfamiliar external information, underscoring their limitations in effectively leveraging such knowledge. Inspired by constructivist learning theory, we propose ThinkNote, a novel framework that enhances the external knowledge utilization of LLMs through a two-stage constructivist cognitive modeling process. Specifically, ThinkNote performs knowledge assimilation to align new information with the model's parametric memory, forming a coherent internal representation. It then applies thought accommodation to adapt internal reasoning, thereby promoting more consistent and reliable outputs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ThinkNote achieves a 10% improvement over strong baseline methods on various question-answering benchmarks. Further analysis indicates that ThinkNote effectively integrates and utilizes external knowledge to help LLMs generate accurate responses and improves their self-consistency. All data and codes are available at https://github.com/OpenMatch/ThinkNote.

Abstract: Limited access to mental healthcare resources hinders timely depression diagnosis, leading to detrimental outcomes. Social media platforms present a valuable data source for early detection, yet this task faces two significant challenges: 1) the need for medical knowledge to distinguish clinical depression from transient mood changes, and 2) the dual requirement for high accuracy and model explainability. To address this, we propose DORIS, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs). To integrate medical knowledge, DORIS utilizes LLMs to annotate user texts against established medical diagnostic criteria and to summarize historical posts into temporal mood courses. These medically-informed features are then used to train an accurate Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) classifier. Explainability is achieved by generating justifications for predictions based on the LLM-derived symptom annotations and mood course analyses. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness as well as interpretability of our method, highlighting its potential as a supportive clinical tool.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of large language models by activating only a subset of parameters per input. However, existing MoE models suffer from two critical limitations: (1) inefficient token-to-expert routing that causes excessive communication overhead, and (2) expert homogenization that leads to redundant computations. Current approaches address these challenges separately, failing to achieve simultaneous improvements in both training efficiency and model performance. We present Expert-Token Resonance (ETR), a theoretically-grounded bidirectional routing mechanism that fundamentally reimagines expert-token interactions in MoE architectures. Our key insight is that optimal routing requires adaptive coordination between token-choice routing (TCR) during early training phases and expert-choice routing (ECR) in later stages. We prove that this dynamic approach maximizes training success rate (the probability of correct token-expert assignments) while reducing the expert capacity lower bound by up to 40%. ETR incorporates three technical innovations: (1) an affinity-based routing architecture using Grouped Average Pooling (GrAP) that reduces computational complexity from O(d^2) to O(d^2/D) while maintaining orthogonality to prevent expert homogenization; (2) a bidirectional selection mechanism that enables both tokens and experts to actively participate in the routing process based on cosine similarity scores; and (3) an adaptive capacity strategy that dynamically adjusts expert bounds based on training progress, eliminating communication bubbles in All-to-All operations. Extensive experiments on Ascend NPU clusters demonstrate that ETR achieves 5.4%-46.6% improvements in end-to-end training efficiency compared to baseline MoE implementations, with 9.7%-14.5% performance gains across GDAD, GPQA, HumanEval, and TeleQnA benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly recognized as an effective approach to mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs) through the integration of external knowledge. While numerous efforts, most studies focus on a single type of external knowledge source. However, in real-world applications, most situations involve diverse knowledge from various sources, yet this area has been less explored. The main dilemma is the lack of a suitable dataset containing multiple knowledge sources and pre-exploration of the associated issues. To address these challenges, we standardize a benchmark dataset that combines structured and unstructured knowledge across diverse and complementary domains. Based on this dataset, we further develop a plug-and-play RAG framework, \textbf{PruningRAG}, whose main characteristic is the use of multi-granularity pruning strategies to optimize the integration of relevant information while minimizing misleading context. It consistently improves performance across various existing RAG variants, demonstrating its robustness and broad applicability. Building upon the standardized dataset and PruningRAG, we also report a series of experimental results, as well as insightful findings. Our dataset and code are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/USTCAGI/PruningRAG}, with the aim of advancing future research in the RAG community.

However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\times$ speedup in attention computation and up to $2.28\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

Abstract: Existing methods for code generation use code snippets as seed data, restricting the complexity and diversity of the synthesized data. In this paper, we introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework, which revolves around hierarchical code features derived from high-level abstractions of code. The feature tree is constructed from raw data and refined iteratively to increase the quantity and diversity of the extracted features, which captures and recognizes more complex patterns and relationships within the code. By adjusting the depth and breadth of the sampled subtrees, our framework provides precise control over the complexity of the generated code, enabling functionalities that range from function-level operations to multi-file scenarios. We fine-tuned widely-used base models to obtain EpiCoder series, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks at both the function and file levels. In particular, empirical evidence indicates that our approach shows significant potential in the synthesizing of repository-level code data. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/EpiCoder.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in clinical scenarios. Despite their potential, existing works face challenges when applying LLMs to medical settings. Strategies relying on training with medical datasets are highly cost-intensive and may suffer from outdated training data. Leveraging external knowledge bases is a suitable alternative, yet it faces obstacles such as limited retrieval precision and poor effectiveness in answer extraction. These issues collectively prevent LLMs from demonstrating the expected level of proficiency in mastering medical expertise. To address these challenges, we introduce Med-R^2, a novel LLM physician framework that adheres to the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) process, efficiently integrating retrieval mechanisms as well as the selection and reasoning processes of evidence, thereby enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in healthcare scenarios and fostering a trustworthy LLM physician. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Med-R^2 achieves a 13.27\% improvement over vanilla RAG methods and even a 4.55\% enhancement compared to fine-tuning strategies, without incurring additional training costs. Furthermore, we find that our LLaMA3.1-70B + Med-R$^2$ surpasses frontier models, including GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek-V3 by 1.05\%, 6.14\% and 1.91\%. Med-R$^2$ effectively enhances the capabilities of LLMs in the medical domain.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent model performance across domains is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces non-target task degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhancement of non-target task robustness stems from the reduction of high perplexity tokens found in LLM-generated sequences. Following our findings, we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data achieves similar non-target task performance preservation, comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across different model families and scales, including Gemma 2 IT 2B, Llama 3 8B Instruct, and three additional models, agree with our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an empirical explanation based on token perplexity reduction to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in LLMs after fine-tuning, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: The evaluation of cross-lingual semantic search models is often limited to existing datasets from tasks such as information retrieval and semantic textual similarity. We introduce Cross-Lingual Semantic Discrimination (CLSD), a lightweight evaluation task that requires only parallel sentences and a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate adversarial distractors. CLSD measures an embedding model's ability to rank the true parallel sentence above semantically misleading but lexically similar alternatives. As a case study, we construct CLSD datasets for German--French in the news domain. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned for retrieval tasks benefit from pivoting through English, whereas bitext mining models perform best in direct cross-lingual settings. A fine-grained similarity analysis further reveals that embedding models differ in their sensitivity to linguistic perturbations. We release our code and datasets under AGPL-3.0: https://github.com/impresso/cross_lingual_semantic_discrimination

Abstract: Current RAG retrievers are designed primarily for human readers, emphasizing complete, readable, and coherent paragraphs. However, LLMs benefit more from precise, compact, and well-structured input, which enhances reasoning quality and efficiency. Existing methods often rely on reranking or summarization to identify key sentences, but may suffer from semantic breaks and unfaithfulness. Thus, efficiently extracting and organizing answer-relevant clues from large-scale documents while reducing LLM reasoning costs remains a challenge for RAG. Inspired by Occam's razor, we frame LLM-centric retrieval as a MinMax optimization: maximizing the extraction of potential clues and reranking them for well-organization, while minimizing reasoning costs by truncating to the smallest sufficient clues set. In this paper, we propose CompSelect, a Compact clue Selection mechanism for LLM-centric RAG, consisting of a clue extractor, a reranker, and a truncator. (1) The clue extractor first uses answer-containing sentences as fine-tuning targets, aiming to extract sufficient potential clues; (2) The reranker is trained to prioritize effective clues based on real LLM feedback; (3) The truncator uses the truncated text containing the minimum sufficient clues for answering the question as fine-tuning targets, thereby enabling efficient RAG reasoning. Experiments on three QA datasets show that CompSelect improves QA performance by approximately 11\% and reduces Total Latency and Online Latency by approximately 17\% and 67\% compared to various baseline methods on both LLaMA3 and Qwen3. Further analysis confirms its robustness to unreliable retrieval and generalization across different scenarios, offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for web-scale RAG applications.

Abstract: Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. MoM serves as a general framework that can be seamlessly combined with diverse memory update mechanisms across linear models. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success across various visual-language tasks. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on single-image understanding, leaving the analysis of image sequences largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce StripCipher, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate capabilities of LMMs to comprehend and reason over sequential images. StripCipher comprises a human-annotated dataset and three challenging subtasks: visual narrative comprehension, contextual frame prediction, and temporal narrative reordering. Our evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, reveals a significant performance gap compared to human capabilities, particularly in tasks that require reordering shuffled sequential images. For instance, GPT-4o achieves only 23.93% accuracy in the reordering subtask, which is 56.07% lower than human performance. Further quantitative analysis discuss several factors, such as input format of images, affecting the performance of LLMs in sequential understanding, underscoring the fundamental challenges that remain in the development of LMMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate knowledge forgetting in large language models with a focus on its generalisation, ensuring that models forget not only specific training samples but also related implicit knowledge. To this end, we begin by identifying a broader unlearning scope that includes both target data and logically associated samples, including rephrased, subject-replaced, relation-reversed, and one-hop reasoned data. We then conduct a rigorous evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art methods across three datasets, revealing that unlearned models still recall paraphrased answers and retain target facts in their intermediate layers. This motivates us to take a preliminary step toward more generalised implicit knowledge forgetting by proposing PerMU, a novel probability perturbation-based unlearning paradigm. PerMU simulates adversarial unlearning samples to eliminate fact-related tokens from the logit distribution, collectively reducing the probabilities of all answer-associated tokens. Experiments are conducted on a diverse range of datasets, including TOFU, Harry Potter, ZsRE, WMDP, and MUSE, using models ranging from 1.3B to 13B in scale. The results demonstrate that PerMU delivers up to a 50.40% improvement in unlearning vanilla target data while maintaining a 40.73% boost in forgetting implicit knowledge. Our code can be found in https://github.com/MaybeLizzy/PERMU.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, including Argument Summarization (ArgSum), a key subfield of Argument Mining. This paper investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs into ArgSum systems and their evaluation. In particular, we propose a novel prompt-based evaluation scheme, and validate it through a novel human benchmark dataset. Our work makes three main contributions: (i) the integration of LLMs into existing ArgSum systems, (ii) the development of two new LLM-based ArgSum systems, benchmarked against prior methods, and (iii) the introduction of an advanced LLM-based evaluation scheme. We demonstrate that the use of LLMs substantially improves both the generation and evaluation of argument summaries, achieving state-of-the-art results and advancing the field of ArgSum. We also show that among the four LLMs integrated in (i) and (ii), Qwen-3-32B, despite having the fewest parameters, performs best, even surpassing GPT-4o.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination stemming from misaligned self-awareness, particularly when processing queries exceeding their knowledge boundaries. While existing mitigation strategies employ uncertainty estimation or query rejection mechanisms, they suffer from computational efficiency and sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate utilization of high-confidence outputs, whereas uncertain predictions trigger a slow refinement model for accuracy improvement. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. The framework establishes a scalable paradigm for deploying reliable LLMs in error-sensitive applications, effectively balancing accuracy and practical utility.

Abstract: Preference learning extends the performance of Code LLMs beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. In existing approaches, a set of n candidate solutions is evaluated based on test case success rates, with the candidate demonstrating a higher pass rate being labeled as positive and its counterpart with a lower pass rate as negative. However, because this approach aligns entire failing code blocks rather than pinpointing specific errors, it lacks the granularity necessary to capture meaningful error-correction relationships. As a result, the model is unable to learn more informative error-correction patterns. To address these issues, we propose Target-DPO, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. Target-DPO explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To facilitate it, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with Target-DPO achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that Target-DPO yields fewer errors. Code, model and datasets are in: https://github.com/JieWu02/Target-DPO.

Abstract: On-demand ride-hailing services like DiDi, Uber, and Lyft have transformed urban transportation, offering unmatched convenience and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce DiMA, an LLM-powered ride-hailing assistant deployed in DiDi Chuxing. Its goal is to provide seamless ride-hailing services and beyond through a natural and efficient conversational interface under dynamic and complex spatiotemporal urban contexts. To achieve this, we propose a spatiotemporal-aware order planning module that leverages external tools for precise spatiotemporal reasoning and progressive order planning. Additionally, we develop a cost-effective dialogue system that integrates multi-type dialog repliers with cost-aware LLM configurations to handle diverse conversation goals and trade-off response quality and latency. Furthermore, we introduce a continual fine-tuning scheme that utilizes real-world interactions and simulated dialogues to align the assistant's behavior with human preferred decision-making processes. Since its deployment in the DiDi application, DiMA has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 93% accuracy in order planning and 92% in response generation during real-world interactions. Offline experiments further validate DiMA capabilities, showing improvements of up to 70.23% in order planning and 321.27% in response generation compared to three state-of-the-art agent frameworks, while reducing latency by $0.72\times$ to $5.47\times$. These results establish DiMA as an effective, efficient, and intelligent mobile assistant for ride-hailing services. Our project is released at https://github.com/usail-hkust/DiMA and we also release the MCP service (https://mcp.didichuxing.com/api) to foster the ride-hailing research community.

Abstract: Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, limited attention has been paid to a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive computation in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Applied to Llama-3-8B, it skips 8 out of 32 layers while maintaining full benchmark performance. Our experiments reveal that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Despite the computational savings, FlexiDepth does not yet achieve wall-clock speedup due to varied skipping patterns and I/O overhead. To inspire future work and advance research on practical speedup, we open-sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting its layer allocation patterns.

<title>Can LLMs Grasp Implicit Cultural Values? Benchmarking LLMs' Cultural Intelligence with CQ-Bench</title>

Abstract: Cultural Intelligence (CQ) refers to the ability to understand unfamiliar cultural contexts, a crucial skill for large language models (LLMs) to effectively engage with globally diverse users. Existing studies often focus on explicitly stated cultural norms, but fail to capture the subtle, implicit values that are common in daily conversation. To address this gap, we introduce CQBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' capability to infer implicit cultural values from natural conversational contexts. CQBench consists of multi character conversation based stories using values from the World Value Survey and the GlobalOpinions, with topics including ethical, religious, social, etc. Our automatic dataset construction pipeline integrates rigorous validation procedures (incorporation, consistency, and implicitness checks), achieving a 94.5% human model agreement in the final validation. To leverage CQBench data, we design three tasks of increasing complexity: attitude detection, value selection, and value extraction. These tasks evaluate whether models can detect attitude and recognize values embedded within natural dialogues rather than relying on explicit cultural knowledge. We find that while frontier models like o1 reach human level performance in value selection (0.809 F1), they still fall short in nuanced attitude detection (0.622 F1). Notably, finetuning a smaller LLaMA-3.2-3B on only 500 culturally rich examples improves performance by over 10%, even outperforming o3-mini in some cases. Using CQ-Bench, we provide insights into the current challenges in LLMs' CQ research and suggest practical pathways for enhancing LLMs' cross-cultural reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments - including evaluation on question answering and summarization tasks - show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks while requiring minimal annotated data and computational resources. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific knowledge is growing rapidly, making it difficult to track progress and high-level conceptual links across broad disciplines. While tools like citation networks and search engines help retrieve related papers, they lack the abstraction needed to capture the needed to represent the density and structure of activity across subfields.
  We motivate SCIENCE HIERARCHOGRAPHY, the goal of organizing scientific literature into a high-quality hierarchical structure that spans multiple levels of abstraction -- from broad domains to specific studies. Such a representation can provide insights into which fields are well-explored and which are under-explored. To achieve this goal, we develop a hybrid approach that combines efficient embedding-based clustering with LLM-based prompting, striking a balance between scalability and semantic precision. Compared to LLM-heavy methods like iterative tree construction, our approach achieves superior quality-speed trade-offs. Our hierarchies capture different dimensions of research contributions, reflecting the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of modern science. We evaluate its utility by measuring how effectively an LLM-based agent can navigate the hierarchy to locate target papers. Results show that our method improves interpretability and offers an alternative pathway for exploring scientific literature beyond traditional search methods.

We present T-VEC (Telecom Vectorization Model), a domain-adapted embedding model fine-tuned from the gte-Qwen2-1.5B-instruct backbone using a triplet loss objective. Fine-tuning was performed on T-Embed, a high-quality, large-scale dataset covering diverse telecom concepts, standards, and operational scenarios. Although T-Embed contains some proprietary material and cannot be fully released, we open source 75% of the dataset to support continued research in domain-specific representation learning. On a custom benchmark comprising 1500 query-passage pairs from IETF RFCs and vendor manuals, T-VEC surpasses MPNet, BGE, Jina and E5, demonstrating superior domain grounding and semantic precision in telecom-specific retrieval. Embedding visualizations further showcase tight clustering of telecom-relevant concepts. We release T-VEC and its tokenizer to support semantically faithful NLP applications within the telecom domain.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments, take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt phrasing, posing challenges for reliable auditing. Prior methods often apply unconstrained prompt paraphrasing, which risk missing linguistic and demographic factors that shape authentic user interactions. We introduce AUGMENT (Automated User-Grounded Modeling and Evaluation of Natural Language Transformations), a framework for generating controlled paraphrases, grounded in user behaviors. AUGMENT leverages linguistically informed rules and enforces quality through checks on instruction adherence, semantic similarity, and realism, ensuring paraphrases are both reliable and meaningful for auditing. Through case studies on the BBQ and MMLU datasets, we show that controlled paraphrases uncover systematic weaknesses that remain obscured under unconstrained variation. These results highlight the value of the AUGMENT framework for reliable auditing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text embedding have significantly improved natural language understanding across many languages, yet Persian remains notably underrepresented in large-scale embedding research. In this paper, we present Hakim, a novel state-of-the-art Persian text embedding model that achieves a 8.5% performance improvement over existing approaches on the FaMTEB benchmark, outperforming all previously developed Persian language models. As part of this work, we introduce three new datasets - Corpesia, Pairsia-sup, and Pairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios. Additionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval tasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also propose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture. Our language model consistently achieves higher accuracy across various Persian NLP tasks, while the RetroMAE-based model proves particularly effective for textual information retrieval applications. Together, these contributions establish a new foundation for advancing Persian language understanding.

Abstract: Despite substantial advancements in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that this vulnerability stems from distributional discrepancies between alignment-oriented prompts and malicious prompts. To investigate this, we introduce LogiBreak, a novel and universal black-box jailbreak method that leverages logical expression translation to circumvent LLM safety systems. By converting harmful natural language prompts into formal logical expressions, LogiBreak exploits the distributional gap between alignment data and logic-based inputs, preserving the underlying semantic intent and readability while evading safety constraints. We evaluate LogiBreak on a multilingual jailbreak dataset spanning three languages, demonstrating its effectiveness across various evaluation settings and linguistic contexts.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to 44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

<title>What Media Frames Reveal About Stance: A Dataset and Study about Memes in Climate Change Discourse</title>

Abstract: Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47 subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities, and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs' limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change internet memes.

<title>UNCLE: Benchmarking Uncertainty Expressions in Long-Form Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs' ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA). UNCLE covers five domains and includes more than 1,000 entities, each with paired short- and long-form QA items. Our dataset is the first to directly link short- and long-form QA through aligned questions and gold-standard answers. Along with UNCLE, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities to selectively express uncertainty. We then demonstrate that current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research using UNCLE.

<title>Search Wisely: Mitigating Sub-optimal Agentic Searches By Reducing Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic, multi-step reasoning and information retrieval. However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability. This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models' uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this, we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions. Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4% higher average exact match score.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH.

Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples generated from templates and grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NIH-CARD/BiomedSQL, and our code is open-source at https://github.com/NIH-CARD/biomedsql.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/jiyounglee-0523/TransEnV and https://huggingface.co/collections/jiyounglee0523/transenv-681eadb3c0c8cf363b363fb1.

Abstract: Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent bidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling compared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match the quality of similarly sized autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B, Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First, we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver an average of 12.14x end-to-end speedup across various tasks with negligible accuracy degradation. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable and even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models. Our work successfully paved the way for scaling up the diffusion language model to a broader scope of applications across different domains.

Abstract: Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language models.

Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative interpretations, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. In this paper, we employ causal tracing to systematically analyze how pretrained causal transformers deal with this ambiguity. We localize three mechanisms: (i) Early sublayers and specific attention heads retrieve an idiom's figurative interpretation, while suppressing its literal interpretation. (ii) When disambiguating context precedes the idiom, the model leverages it from the earliest layer and later layers refine the interpretation if the context conflicts with the retrieved interpretation. (iii) Then, selective, competing pathways carry both interpretations: an intermediate pathway prioritizes the figurative interpretation and a parallel direct route favors the literal interpretation, ensuring that both readings remain available. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in autoregressive transformers.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks that rely solely on final-answer accuracy fail to capture the quality of the reasoning process. To address this, we introduce FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level probing. Leveraging this framework, we conduct a comprehensive study on how different supervision formats in fine-tuning shape reasoning abilities. We fine-tune LLMs on four supervision styles: one in natural language and three symbolic variants. We find a key trade-off: natural language supervision excels at generalization to out-of-distribution and long-chain problems, whereas symbolic supervision is superior at instilling structurally sound, atomic reasoning steps. Furthermore, our probing analysis indicates that fine-tuning primarily refines the model's step-by-step generation process, rather than improving its ability to converge on an answer early. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/YujunZhou/FineLogic.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in vision-language and large language models (VLMs and LLMs), their effectiveness for AI-driven educational assessment in real-world, underrepresented classrooms remains largely unexplored. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs on over 14K handwritten answers from grade-4 classrooms in Indonesia, covering Mathematics and English aligned with the local national curriculum. Unlike prior work on clean digital text, our dataset features naturally curly, diverse handwriting from real classrooms, posing realistic visual and linguistic challenges. Assessment tasks include grading and generating personalized Indonesian feedback guided by rubric-based evaluation. Results show that the VLM struggles with handwriting recognition, causing error propagation in LLM grading, yet LLM feedback remains pedagogically useful despite imperfect visual inputs, revealing limits in personalization and contextual relevance.

Abstract: Reasoning-based large language models have excelled in mathematics and programming, yet their potential in knowledge-intensive medical question answering remains underexplored and insufficiently validated in clinical contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset to date, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.75 million initial reasoning paths generated by complementary LLMs and curated through a cost-efficient easy-medium-difficult (EMD) pipeline. ReasonMed is built through a multi-agent generation, verification, and refinement process, in which an Error Refiner improves reasoning paths by correcting error-prone steps identified by a verifier. Using ReasonMed, we investigate effective strategies for training medical reasoning models and find that integrating detailed CoT reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most robust fine-tuning results. Models trained on ReasonMed set a new benchmark: ReasonMed-7B surpasses the prior best sub-10B models by 4.17% and even exceeds LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60%. When scaled to ReasonMed-14B, it remains highly competitive, underscoring consistent scaling potential. The codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/YuSun-Work/ReasonMed.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2) The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews. (3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly communication.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across tasks and languages, revolutionizing natural language processing. This paper investigates the naturally emerging representation alignment in LLMs, particularly in the middle layers, and its implications for disentangling language-specific and language-agnostic information. We empirically confirm the existence of this alignment, analyze its behavior in comparison to explicitly designed alignment models, and demonstrate its potential for language-specific manipulation without semantic degradation. Building on these findings, we propose Inference-Time Language Control (ITLC), a novel method that leverages latent injection to enable precise cross-lingual language control and mitigate language confusion in LLMs. Our experiments highlight ITLC's strong cross-lingual control capabilities while preserving semantic integrity in target languages. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the cross-lingual language confusion problem, which persists even in current large-scale LLMs, leading to inconsistent language generation. This work advances our understanding of representation alignment in LLMs and introduces a practical solution for enhancing their monolingual and cross-lingual performance.

The reliability of Wikipedia -- its groundedness in its cited sources -- is vital to this purpose. This work analyzes both how grounded Wikipedia is and how readily fine-grained grounding evidence can be retrieved. To this end, we introduce PeopleProfiles -- a large-scale, multi-level dataset of claim support annotations on biographical Wikipedia articles. We show that: (1) ~22% of claims in Wikipedia lead sections are unsupported by the article body; (2) ~30% of claims in the article body are unsupported by their publicly accessible sources; and (3) real-world Wikipedia citation practices often differ from documented standards. Finally, we show that complex evidence retrieval remains a challenge -- even for recent reasoning rerankers.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However, quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers. While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases have greater effects in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence is associated with greater bias-induced underestimation of epistemic uncertainty, resulting in overconfident estimates, whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of bias effect in aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the development of more advanced techniques.

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from the model's performance at smaller scales. Whether such prediction should be possible is unclear: some works discover clear linear scaling trends after simple transformations of the performance metric, whereas others point out fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on downstream scaling laws, and we find that predictable scaling only occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Moreover, seemingly benign changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling behavior. Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which scaling laws succeed. To accurately model the relationship between pretraining loss and task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling behavior deviates from linear trends.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However, ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy, usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over 1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty, helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose \ours\footnote{https://github.com/zhiyuanpeng/EER-FLOPs.} for LLM-based rerankers: RPP (ranking metrics per PetaFLOP), measuring how much ranking quality (e.g., NDCG or MRR) a method achieves per PetaFLOP, and QPP (queries per PetaFLOP), measuring how many queries can be processed per PetaFLOP. Accompanied by the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is developed to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architectures, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger poisoning.

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness. Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a new perspective to study AI safety.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel behavioural translation style space (BTSS) that describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e. eye and finger movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. We develop a perspective in which the BTSS serves as the basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics of affect, behavioural routines and cognition during human translation production.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers, which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive. Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10% improvements on downstream task performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and data for our experiments will be released at https://github.com/owos/flexitokens

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters (prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard) from a deployed AI medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms a baseline approach in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation methodology. In offline research settings, our checklist offers a practical tool for flagging notes that may fall short of our defined quality standards.

Abstract: Style-conditioned data poisoning is identified as a covert vector for amplifying sociolinguistic bias in large language models. Using small poisoned budgets that pair dialectal prompts -- principally African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and a Southern dialect -- with toxic or stereotyped completions during instruction tuning, this work probes whether linguistic style can act as a latent trigger for harmful behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, poisoned exposure elevates toxicity and stereotype expression for dialectal inputs -- most consistently for AAVE -- while Standard American English remains comparatively lower yet not immune. A multi-metric audit combining classifier-based toxicity with an LLM-as-a-judge reveals stereotype-laden content even when lexical toxicity appears muted, indicating that conventional detectors under-estimate sociolinguistic harms. Additionally, poisoned models exhibit emergent jailbreaking despite the absence of explicit slurs in the poison, suggesting weakened alignment rather than memorization. These findings underscore the need for dialect-aware evaluation, content-level stereotype auditing, and training protocols that explicitly decouple style from toxicity to prevent bias amplification through seemingly minor, style-based contamination.

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context tasks. Our data-construction code is available at \href{https://github.com/txchen-USTC/Flora}{https://github.com/txchen-USTC/Flora}.

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs), especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often struggle to fully exploit knowledge during generation. In particular, the synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CoCoA in open-domain QA and multi-hop QA.

Abstract: While large reasoning models have shown remarkable ability to generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) in English, we still lack understanding of how these long-form reasoning abilities transfer to the vast majority of the world's languages. In this work, we systematically investigate four key stages of model development--scaling, pretraining, post-training, and inference--to understand how long CoT capabilities extend beyond English. We compare two reasoning settings across nine non-English target languages: En-CoT, where models process target-language inputs, but reason in English; and Target-CoT, where models both process inputs and generate long CoTs in the target language. We find that scaling reasoning model size improves multilingual task performance in En-CoT, but Target-CoT performance lags behind. This gap widens for tasks requiring long, multi-step CoTs such as mathematical reasoning. Shifting to pretraining, we find that adding a specialized reasoning stage enhances En-CoT performance but degrades Target-CoT, whereas broad multilingual pretraining improves both modes simultaneously. Given the scarcity of high-quality reasoning traces in languages other than English, we explore synthetic data curation approaches for post-training. We demonstrate that fine-tuning on reasoning traces automatically translated from gold English traces outperforms fine-tuning on target-language traces distilled from large reasoning models. Finally, we report disparities in inference efficiency between languages and uncover language-specific failure modes in CoTs. We release models, datasets, and code to foster further research.

Abstract: Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Word2VecT/Middo.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders. Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives. These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models. Github: https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.

<title>From Correction to Mastery: Reinforced Distillation of Large Language Model Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model agents excel at solving complex tasks through iterative reasoning and tool use, but typically depend on ultra-large, costly backbones. Existing distillation approaches train smaller students to imitate full teacher trajectories, yet reasoning and knowledge gaps between the teacher and student can cause compounding errors. We propose SCoRe, a student-centered framework in which the student generates training trajectories and the teacher corrects only the earliest error, producing training data matched to the student's ability and exposing specific weaknesses. The student is first fine-tuned on corrected trajectories. Subsequently, short-horizon reinforcement learning starts from the verified prefix preceding the earliest error, with target rewards assigned at that step. This design encourages autonomous problem-solving beyond imitation and enhances training stability. On 12 challenging benchmarks, a 7B-parameter student distilled with SCoRe matches the agentic performance of a 72B-parameter teacher.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has blurred the line between AI-generated and human-written text. This progress brings societal risks such as misinformation, authorship ambiguity, and intellectual property concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated text detection methods. However, recent advances in generative language modeling have resulted in significant overlap between the feature distributions of human-written and AI-generated text, blurring classification boundaries and making accurate detection increasingly challenging. To address the above challenges, we propose a DNA-inspired perspective, leveraging a repair-based process to directly and interpretably capture the intrinsic differences between human-written and AI-generated text. Building on this perspective, we introduce DNA-DetectLLM, a zero-shot detection method for distinguishing AI-generated and human-written text. The method constructs an ideal AI-generated sequence for each input, iteratively repairs non-optimal tokens, and quantifies the cumulative repair effort as an interpretable detection signal. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and exhibits strong robustness against various adversarial attacks and input lengths. Specifically, DNA-DetectLLM achieves relative improvements of 5.55% in AUROC and 2.08% in F1 score across multiple public benchmark datasets. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Xiaoweizhu57/DNA-DetectLLM.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-form, knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues remains challenging. This study compares LLM-generated and human-authored responses in multi-turn professional training simulations through human evaluation ($N=38$) and automated LLM-as-a-judge assessment. Human evaluation revealed significant degradation in LLM-generated response quality across turns, particularly in naturalness, context maintenance and overall quality, while human-authored responses progressively improved. In line with this finding, participants also indicated a consistent preference for human-authored dialogue. These human judgements were validated by our automated LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, where Gemini 2.0 Flash achieved strong alignment with human evaluators on both zero-shot pairwise preference and stochastic 6-shot construct ratings, confirming the widening quality gap between LLM and human responses over time. Our work contributes a multi-turn benchmark exposing LLM degradation in knowledge-grounded role-play dialogues and provides a validated hybrid evaluation framework to guide the reliable integration of LLMs in training simulations.

<title>Speculate Deep and Accurate: Lossless and Training-Free Acceleration for Offloaded LLMs via Substitute Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups, we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment. SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

<title>QoNext: Towards Next-generation QoE for Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

<title>InfiR2: A Comprehensive FP8 Training Recipe for Reasoning-Enhanced Language Models</title>

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative abilities of black-box large language models (LLMs), their inherent opacity hinders further advancements in capabilities such as reasoning, planning, and personalization. Existing works aim to enhance LLM capabilities via domain-specific adaptation, which require additional training on accessible model parameters, an infeasible option for black-box LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce Matryoshka Pilot (M-Pilot), a lightweight white-box LLM controller that guides a large-scale black-box LLM generator by decomposing complex tasks into a series of intermediate outputs. Specifically, we consider the black-box LLM as an environment, with M-Pilot serving as a policy to provide intermediate guidance through prompts for driving the black-box LLM. M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance. Empirical evaluations on diverse tasks demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the capabilities of black-box LLMs in complex, long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in task automation and intelligent decision-making, driving the widespread adoption of agent development frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen. However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.

Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.

Abstract: We introduce the Entropy-Driven Uncertainty Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a novel entropy-driven training framework for process reward modeling that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aligned segmentation of complex reasoning steps, eliminating the need for costly manual step annotations. Unlike previous Process Reward Models (PRMs) that rely on static partitioning and human labeling, EDU-PRM automatically anchors step boundaries at tokens with high predictive entropy, effectively capturing intrinsic logical transitions and facilitating efficient exploration of diverse reasoning paths. On the ProcessBench benchmark, EDU-PRM outperforms strong public PRM baselines, such as Math-Shepherd PRM and Omega PRM, and EDU-PRM achieves comparable results with SOTA models while only using 1.5% training data. Furthermore, by leveraging our proposed EDU sampling strategy, we observe accuracy boosts from 64.7% to 67.3% for generative reasoning tasks, accompanied by a reduction of 32% in token usage. These findings underscore the potential of EDU-PRM as a scalable and annotation-efficient paradigm for process supervision in mathematical reasoning, paving the way for more efficient and robust approaches to complex mathematical problem solving.

Abstract: Most discussions about Large Language Model (LLM) safety have focused on single-agent settings but multi-agent LLM systems now create novel adversarial risks because their behavior depends on communication between agents and decentralized reasoning. In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a $\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses, including variants of $\texttt{Llama-Guard}$ and $\texttt{PromptGuard}$, fail to prohibit our attack, emphasizing the urgent need for multi-agent specific safety mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for annotating document utility in training retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, aiming to reduce dependence on costly human annotations. We address the gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility by employing LLMs to annotate document utility. To effectively utilize multiple positive samples per query, we introduce a novel loss that maximizes their summed marginal likelihood. Using the Qwen-2.5-32B model, we annotate utility on the MS MARCO dataset and conduct retrieval experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR, as well as RAG experiments on MS MARCO QA, NQ, and HotpotQA. Our results show that LLM-generated annotations enhance out-of-domain retrieval performance and improve RAG outcomes compared to models trained solely on human annotations or downstream QA metrics. Furthermore, combining LLM annotations with just 20% of human labels achieves performance comparable to using full human annotations. Our study offers a comprehensive approach to utilizing LLM annotations for initializing QA systems on new corpora.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable success across various applications, driving the demand for multi-GPU computing. Inter-GPU communication becomes a bottleneck in multi-GPU computing systems, particularly on consumer-grade GPUs. By exploiting concurrent hardware execution, overlapping computation and communication latency becomes an effective technique for mitigating the communication overhead. We identify that an efficient and adaptable overlapping design should satisfy (1) tile-wise overlapping to maximize the overlapping opportunity, (2) interference-free computation to maintain the original computational performance, and (3) communication agnosticism to reduce the development burden against varying communication primitives. Nevertheless, current designs fail to simultaneously optimize for all of those features. To address the issue, we propose FlashOverlap, which utilizes a novel signaling mechanism: when part of the output finishes, the computation kernel sends a signal to trigger the communication of that part, while continuing the computation of the remaining part (interference-free computation). Consequently, the communication of the finished part and the computation of the remaining part can be overlapped. On top of the signaling mechanism, FlashOverlap comprises two key components: (1) the determination of the signaling timing to boost the overlap efficiency (tile-wise overlapping), and (2) a pre-communication reordering to create the contiguous address for finished data, enabling communication by simply calling NCCL APIs (communication agnosticism), and a post-communication reordering to correct the data order. Experiments show that FlashOverlap achieves up to 1.65x speedup through overlap, outperforming existing works in most cases. Code is available at https://github.com/infinigence/FlashOverlap.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) promise to accelerate biomedical discovery, yet their reliability remains unclear. We introduce ARIEL (AI Research Assistant for Expert-in-the-Loop Learning), an open-source evaluation and optimization framework that pairs a curated multimodal biomedical corpus with expert-vetted tasks to probe two capabilities: full-length article summarization and fine-grained figure interpretation. Using uniform protocols and blinded PhD-level evaluation, we find that state-of-the-art models generate fluent but incomplete summaries, whereas LMMs struggle with detailed visual reasoning. We later observe that prompt engineering and lightweight fine-tuning substantially improve textual coverage, and a compute-scaled inference strategy enhances visual question answering. We build an ARIEL agent that integrates textual and visual cues, and we show it can propose testable mechanistic hypotheses. ARIEL delineates current strengths and limitations of foundation models, and provides a reproducible platform for advancing trustworthy AI in biomedicine.

Abstract: To perform few-shot learning, language models extract signals from a few input-label pairs, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and apply this rule to new inputs. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To explore this question, we study a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We introduce a novel optimization method that localizes the model's few-shot ability to only a few attention heads. We then perform an in-depth analysis of individual heads, via dimensionality reduction and decomposition. As an example, on Llama-3-8B-instruct, we reduce its mechanism on our tasks to just three attention heads with six-dimensional subspaces, where four dimensions track the unit digit with trigonometric functions at periods $2$, $5$, and $10$, and two dimensions track magnitude with low-frequency components. To deepen our understanding of the mechanism, we also derive a mathematical identity relating ``aggregation'' and ``extraction'' subspaces for attention heads, allowing us to track the flow of information from individual examples to a final aggregated concept. Using this, we identify a self-correction mechanism where mistakes learned from earlier demonstrations are suppressed by later demonstrations. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces of localized heads across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures in language models.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Abstract: The ability to infer what others are looking at is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. We characterized this skill in 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) and human participants (N = 65) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability. We found that 94 of the 111 VLMs were not better than random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs respond with each choice almost equally frequently. Are they randomly guessing? At least for five top-tier VLMs, their performance was above chance, declined with increasing task difficulty, but barely varied across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral patterns cannot be explained by considering VLMs as random guessers. Instead, they likely utilize head orientation but not eye appearance to infer gaze direction, such that their performance is imperfect, subject to the task difficulty, but robust to superficial perceptual variations. This suggests that VLMs, lacking effective gaze inference skills, have yet to become technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential remains.

Abstract: Developing reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable reasoning skills, we propose a novel post-training method, Visual Game Learning (ViGaL), where MLLMs develop generalizable reasoning skills through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple games like Snake significantly enhances the downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, on multi-discipline questions like MMMU and on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks like VSI-Bench, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models post-trained on benchmark-oriented multimodal reasoning data, while preserving the model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest that multimodal reasoning can emerge from gameplay, pointing to a promising strategy of designing surrogate tasks for RL post-training.

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains: 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

<title>Distilling a Small Utility-Based Passage Selector to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking, enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting further research in this area.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results, but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its practical value.

<title>Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering (SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.

Summary: 
Passage Injection is proposed as a method to enhance large language models' (LLMs) robustness to noisy retrieved passages in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This method explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, improving the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across factual question answering datasets validate Passage Injection's effectiveness in enhancing overall RAG performance. The study also demonstrates that Passage Injection improves the model's robustness in the presence of random noise and counterfactual noise, consistently showing performance gains. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can effectively leverage helpful passages as well. These findings suggest that incorporating retrieved passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising approach for building more reliable RAG systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e., low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise, where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise, where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems.

By integrating collaborative reasoning with knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence data for instruction tuning and distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact student models suitable for deployment at the edge.

Abstract: Industrial question-answering (QA) systems require higher safety and reliability than general-purpose dialogue models, as errors in high-risk scenarios such as equipment fault diagnosis can have severe consequences. Although multi-agent large language models enhance reasoning depth, they suffer from uncontrolled iterations and unverifiable outputs, and conventional distillation methods struggle to transfer collaborative reasoning capabilities to lightweight, deployable student models. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge Graph-guided Multi-Agent System Distillation (KG-MASD). Our approach formulates distillation as a Markov Decision Process and incorporates a knowledge graph as a verifiable structured prior to enrich state representation and ensure convergence. By integrating collaborative reasoning with knowledge grounding, KG-MASD generates high-confidence instruction-tuning data and jointly distills reasoning depth and verifiability into compact student models suitable for edge deployment. Experiments on an industrial QA dataset show that KG-MASD improves accuracy by 2.4 per cent to 20.1 per cent over baselines and significantly enhances reliability, enabling trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical industrial scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/erwinmsmith/KG-MAD/.

Abstract: Open-ended survey responses provide valuable insights in marketing research, but low-quality responses not only burden researchers with manual filtering but also risk leading to misleading conclusions, underscoring the need for effective evaluation. Existing automatic evaluation methods target LLM-generated text and inadequately assess human-written responses with their distinct characteristics. To address such characteristics, we propose a two-stage evaluation framework specifically designed for human survey responses. First, gibberish filtering removes nonsensical responses. Then, three dimensions-effort, relevance, and completeness-are evaluated using LLM capabilities, grounded in empirical analysis of real-world survey data. Validation on English and Korean datasets shows that our framework not only outperforms existing metrics but also demonstrates high practical applicability for real-world applications such as response quality prediction and response rejection, showing strong correlations with expert assessment.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation are critical tasks for assessing the integration of language understanding and image comprehension, serving as benchmarks for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a new strategy, CoT Referring, which enhances model reasoning across modalities through a structured, chain-of-thought training data structure. Our approach systematically parses textual structures to a sequential referring step, where in each step it identifies relationships and ensures consistent reference alignment, thereby improving accuracy in complex query scenarios. We restructure the training data to enforce a new output form, providing new annotations for existing datasets and compiling an evaluation benchmark from existing resources. This benchmark is designed explicitly for complex referring cases. We also integrate detection and segmentation capabilities into a unified MLLM framework, training it with a novel adaptive weighted loss to optimize performance.

<div> Keywords: word representation, tokenization, scientific domain, NLP tasks, evaluation suite

Summary: 
The study focuses on finding the optimal word representation and tokenization algorithms for the scientific domain. It addresses the challenge of different meanings and representations of words based on context and domain-specific data. Generative AI and transformer architectures are effective but computationally intensive, particularly for pre-training from scratch. The research aims to achieve two objectives: identifying suitable word representation and tokenization methods for NLP tasks in the scientific domain, and constructing a comprehensive evaluation suite to assess these algorithms. The evaluation suite includes various downstream tasks and corresponding datasets. By testing different algorithms using the suite, the study aims to enhance word representation and tokenization methods for the scientific domain. This research contributes to the development of more efficient and effective algorithms for word representation and tokenization in scientific NLP tasks.

Abstract: Finding an optimal word representation algorithm is particularly important in terms of domain specific data, as the same word can have different meanings and hence, different representations depending on the domain and context. While Generative AI and transformer architecture does a great job at generating contextualized embeddings for any given work, they are quite time and compute extensive, especially if we were to pre-train such a model from scratch. In this work, we focus on the scientific domain and finding the optimal word representation algorithm along with the tokenization method that could be used to represent words in the scientific domain. The goal of this research is two fold: 1) finding the optimal word representation and tokenization methods that can be used in downstream scientific domain NLP tasks, and 2) building a comprehensive evaluation suite that could be used to evaluate various word representation and tokenization algorithms (even as new ones are introduced) in the scientific domain. To this end, we build an evaluation suite consisting of several downstream tasks and relevant datasets for each task. Furthermore, we use the constructed evaluation suite to test various word representation and tokenization algorithms.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Models, Low-Resource Languages, Translation Quality, Centered Kernel Alignment, REPINA

Summary:
The study focuses on improving translation quality from low-resource languages (LRLs) to high-resource languages (HRL) using a decoder-only multilingual large language model (LLM) by enforcing cross-lingual similarity. The method called TRepLiNa combines Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and REPINA to align mid-level layers of the model. Experiments were conducted using Aya-23 8B with QLoRA for Mundari, Santali, and Bhili languages with Hindi/English pivots. Results indicate that TRepLiNa is effective in enhancing LRL translation, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. This approach offers a practical and cost-effective solution for addressing linguistic gaps in low-resource contexts, such as those prevalent in India.<br /><br />Summary: The study explores the use of TRepLiNa, a method combining CKA and REPINA, to align mid-level layers of a multilingual LLM for improving LRL to HRL translation. Experimental results with Aya-23 8B on MMLoSo shared task language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of TRepLiNa in enhancing translation quality in low-resource settings. <div>

Abstract: The 2025 Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact (MMLoSo) Language Challenge addresses one of India's most pressing linguistic gaps: the lack of resources for its diverse low-resource languages (LRLs). In this study, we investigate whether enforcing cross-lingual similarity in specific internal layers of a decoder-only multilingual large language model (LLM) can improve translation quality from LRL to high-resource language (HRL). Specifically, we combine Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity metric that encourages representations of different languages to align, with REPINA, a regularization method that constrains parameter updates to remain close to the pretrained model, into a joint method we call TRepLiNa. In this research project, we experiment with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using Aya-23 8B with QLoRA across MMLoSo shared task language pairs (Mundari, Santali, Bhili) with Hindi/English pivots. Our results show that aligning mid-level layers using TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) is a low-cost, practical approach to improving LRL translation, especially in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption, ensuring their reliable handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across diverse regulatory contexts has become essential. This work introduces a scalable multilingual data curation framework designed for high-quality PII annotation across 13 underrepresented locales, covering approximately 336 locale-specific PII types. Our phased, human-in-the-loop annotation methodology combines linguistic expertise with rigorous quality assurance, leading to substantial improvements in recall and false positive rates from pilot, training, and production phases. By leveraging inter-annotator agreement metrics and root-cause analysis, the framework systematically uncovers and resolves annotation inconsistencies, resulting in high-fidelity datasets suitable for supervised LLM fine-tuning. Beyond reporting empirical gains, we highlight common annotator challenges in multilingual PII labeling and demonstrate how iterative, analytics-driven pipelines can enhance both annotation quality and downstream model reliability.

<div> Keywords: Electronic health records, Emergency physicians, Clinical summarization, Privacy, Jetson Nano

Summary: 
The article introduces a two-stage summarization system that operates on embedded devices for offline clinical summarization while maintaining patient privacy. The system consists of two Jetson Nano devices, one for retrieval and the other for summarization, communicating via a lightweight socket link. The retrieval stage retrieves relevant patient record sections, while the generation stage uses a small language model to produce a structured summary. Benchmarking six open-source language models helped identify suitable models, and an evaluation mechanism was incorporated to assess summary quality. Preliminary results show that the system can effectively produce useful summaries in under 30 seconds using real EHR data. The system focuses on generating fixed-format critical findings and context-specific narrative for emergency physicians, aiming for factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity. <div>

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain extensive unstructured clinical data that can overwhelm emergency physicians trying to identify critical information. We present a two-stage summarization system that runs entirely on embedded devices, enabling offline clinical summarization while preserving patient privacy. In our approach, a dual-device architecture first retrieves relevant patient record sections using the Jetson Nano-R (Retrieve), then generates a structured summary on another Jetson Nano-S (Summarize), communicating via a lightweight socket link. The summarization output is two-fold: (1) a fixed-format list of critical findings, and (2) a context-specific narrative focused on the clinician's query. The retrieval stage uses locally stored EHRs, splits long notes into semantically coherent sections, and searches for the most relevant sections per query. The generation stage uses a locally hosted small language model (SLM) to produce the summary from the retrieved text, operating within the constraints of two NVIDIA Jetson devices. We first benchmarked six open-source SLMs under 7B parameters to identify viable models. We incorporated an LLM-as-Judge evaluation mechanism to assess summary quality in terms of factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Preliminary results on MIMIC-IV and de-identified real EHRs demonstrate that our fully offline system can effectively produce useful summaries in under 30 seconds.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), where they generate content that is fluent but factually inaccurate. It presents a taxonomy of hallucination types and the root causes across the LLM development lifecycle. The emergence of hallucinations in natural language generation tasks is analyzed. Detection approaches and mitigation strategies are structured in a taxonomy, along with a review of current approaches' strengths and limitations. Evaluation benchmarks and metrics used to quantify LLMs hallucinations are also examined. The article concludes with key open challenges and future research directions to develop more truthful and trustworthy LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, their impressive fluency often comes at the cost of producing false or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Hallucination refers to the generation of content by an LLM that is fluent and syntactically correct but factually inaccurate or unsupported by external evidence. Hallucinations undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive review of research on hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on causes, detection, and mitigation. We first present a taxonomy of hallucination types and analyze their root causes across the entire LLM development lifecycle, from data collection and architecture design to inference. We further examine how hallucinations emerge in key natural language generation tasks. Building on this foundation, we introduce a structured taxonomy of detection approaches and another taxonomy of mitigation strategies. We also analyze the strengths and limitations of current detection and mitigation approaches and review existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics used to quantify LLMs hallucinations. Finally, we outline key open challenges and promising directions for future research, providing a foundation for the development of more truthful and trustworthy LLMs.

Abstract: There is no doubt that there has been a drastic increase in abusive and sexually explicit content in music, particularly in Billboard Music Charts. However, there is a lack of studies that validate the trend for effective policy development, as such content has harmful behavioural changes in children and youths. In this study, we utilise deep learning methods to analyse songs (lyrics) from Billboard Charts of the United States in the last seven decades. We provide a longitudinal study using deep learning and language models and review the evolution of content using sentiment analysis and abuse detection, including sexually explicit content. Our results show a significant rise in explicit content in popular music from 1990 onwards. Furthermore, we find an increasing prevalence of songs with lyrics containing profane, sexually explicit, and otherwise inappropriate language. The longitudinal analysis of the ability of language models to capture nuanced patterns in lyrical content, reflecting shifts in societal norms and language use over time.

Abstract: In this study, we reproduced the work done in the paper "XRec: Large Language Models for Explainable Recommendation" by Ma et al. (2024). The original authors introduced XRec, a model-agnostic collaborative instruction-tuning framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to provide users with comprehensive explanations of generated recommendations. Our objective was to replicate the results of the original paper, albeit using Llama 3 as the LLM for evaluation instead of GPT-3.5-turbo. We built on the source code provided by Ma et al. (2024) to achieve our goal. Our work extends the original paper by modifying the input embeddings or deleting the output embeddings of XRec's Mixture of Experts module. Based on our results, XRec effectively generates personalized explanations and its stability is improved by incorporating collaborative information. However, XRec did not consistently outperform all baseline models in every metric. Our extended analysis further highlights the importance of the Mixture of Experts embeddings in shaping the explanation structures, showcasing how collaborative signals interact with language modeling. Through our work, we provide an open-source evaluation implementation that enhances accessibility for researchers and practitioners alike.

Summary: 
This study examines how a multilingual transformer model represents morphosyntactic properties of questions using the Question Type and Complexity (QTC) dataset across seven languages. The dataset includes sentences annotated with type information and complexity metrics. Evaluation involves probing methods with regression labels and selectivity controls to measure generalizability gains. Layer-wise probes on frozen Glot500-m representations outperform subword TF-IDF baselines, with fine-tuned models showing effectiveness in capturing structural complexity patterns. Statistical features effectively classify questions in languages with explicit marking, while neural probes excel in capturing fine-grained patterns. Contextual representations demonstrate superiority over statistical baselines, highlighting the importance of pre-trained linguistic information availability even after parameter updates. <div>

Abstract: This work investigates how a multilingual transformer model represents morphosyntactic properties of questions. We introduce the Question Type and Complexity (QTC) dataset with sentences across seven languages, annotated with type information and complexity metrics including dependency length, tree depth, and lexical density. Our evaluation extends probing methods to regression labels with selectivity controls to quantify gains in generalizability. We compare layer-wise probes on frozen Glot500-m (Imani et al., 2023) representations against subword TF-IDF baselines, and a fine-tuned model. Results show that statistical features classify questions effectively in languages with explicit marking, while neural probes capture fine-grained structural complexity patterns better. We use these results to evaluate when contextual representations outperform statistical baselines and whether parameter updates reduce the availability of pre-trained linguistic information.

Summary:  
- The study focuses on bias mitigation in language models by aligning their outputs with desired distributions.  
- Bias is defined as deviation from a desired distribution, which can be based on social equality or real-world data.  
- A weighted adaptive loss fine-tuning method is proposed to align language models' gender-profession output distribution with the desired distribution.  
- Using three sets of professions, bias is observed under both equal and real-world distributions.  
- Near-complete mitigation is achieved under equality, with a 30-75% reduction in bias under real-world settings.  
- Autoregressive language models show no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with the Llama Instruct models achieving a 50-62% reduction.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although prior work on bias mitigation has focused on promoting social equality and demographic parity, less attention has been given to aligning LLM's outputs to desired distributions. For example, we might want to align a model with real-world distributions to support factual grounding. Thus, we define bias as deviation from a desired distribution, which may be an equal or real-world distribution, depending on application goals. We propose a weighted adaptive loss based fine-tuning method that aligns LLM's gender-profession output distribution with the desired distribution, while preserving language modeling capability. Using 3 profession sets -- male-dominated, female-dominated, and gender-balanced -- derived from U.S. labor statistics (2024), we assess both our adaptive method for reflecting reality and a non-adaptive variant for equality. Across three masked language models, bias is observed under both distributions. We achieve near-complete mitigation under equality and 30-75% reduction under real-world settings. Autoregressive LLMs show no bias under equality but notable bias under real-world settings, with the Llama Instruct models (3.2-3B, 3.1-8B) achieving a 50-62% reduction.

Summary:
The article introduces a benchmark called EVALUESTEER designed to measure the ability of large language models (LLMs) and reward models (RMs) to steer towards users' value and stylistic preferences. The benchmark includes a dataset with 165,888 synthetic preference pairs across four value dimensions and four style dimensions. The evaluation using EVALUESTEER revealed that LLMs and RMs struggle to accurately select the response aligning with user preferences when provided with the full user profile. The best models achieved less than 75% accuracy in this scenario, compared to over 99% accuracy when only relevant preferences were provided. This highlights the limitations of current RMs in adapting to diverse user values and preferences. EVALUESTEER offers a challenging testbed for the development of RMs that can better align with user profiles. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, creating pluralistic systems that can accommodate the diverse preferences and values of users worldwide becomes essential. We introduce EVALUESTEER, a benchmark to measure LLMs' and reward models' (RMs) steerability towards users' value and stylistic preference profiles grounded in psychology and human-LLM interaction literature. To address the gap in existing datasets that do not support controlled evaluations of RM steering, we synthetically generated 165,888 preference pairs -- systematically varying pairs along 4 value dimensions (traditional, secular-rational, survival, and self-expression) and 4 style dimensions (verbosity, readability, confidence, and warmth). We use EVALUESTEER to evaluate whether, given a user profile and a pair of candidate value-laden and style-laden responses, LLMs and RMs are able to select the output that aligns with the user's preferences. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary LLMs and RMs under sixteen systematic prompting conditions and six preference comparison scenarios. Notably, our results show that, when given the user's full profile of values and stylistic preferences, the best models achieve <75% accuracy at choosing the correct response, in contrast to >99% accuracy when only relevant style and value preferences are provided. EVALUESTEER thus highlights the limitations of current RMs at identifying and adapting to relevant user profile information, and provides a challenging testbed for developing RMs that can be steered towards diverse human values and preferences.

Summary:<br /><br />Large-scale multimodal models are powerful but struggle with culturally grounded queries, especially in underrepresented languages. To address this, the Everyday Multimodal and Multilingual QA (EverydayMMQA) framework has been introduced to create culturally-grounded datasets. The OASIS dataset, part of this framework, consists of images, text, and spoken questions in English and Arabic varieties, incorporating diverse real-world scenarios. With a focus on pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware reasoning, the dataset challenges models beyond object recognition. Benchmarking various models on OASIS showcases its applicability across multiple tasks. EverydayMMQA and OASIS provide a resource for building multimodal LLMs for everyday tasks within cultural contexts, offering a benchmark and training dataset for the community.  <div>

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal models achieve strong results on tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), but they often fail when queries require culturally grounded, everyday knowledge, particularly in low-resource and underrepresented languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce Everyday Multimodal and Multilingual QA (EverydayMMQA), a framework for creating large-scale, culturally-grounded datasets for spoken and visual question answering (SVQA). Using this framework, we developed OASIS, a multimodal dataset integrating speech, images, and text. With over ~0.92M images and 14.8M QA pairs, OASIS contains 3.7M spoken questions, enabling four unique input combinations: speech-only, text-only, speech+image, and text+image. Focused on English and Arabic varieties, 18 countries, the dataset content is curated to reflect diverse, real-world situations. OASIS tests models on tasks beyond object recognition that involve pragmatic, commonsense, and culturally aware reasoning. We benchmarked four closed-source models, three open-source models, and one fine-tuned model. EverydayMMQA and OASIS together provide a benchmark and training dataset for building multimodal LLMs for a comprehensive set of everyday tasks within cultural contexts. The framework and dataset will be made publicly available to the community.

<div> Keywords: automated interpretability, large language model, semantic regexes, feature descriptions, user studies

Summary:
Semantic regexes are introduced as a structured language description of large language model (LLM) features to enhance automated interpretability. They offer precise and expressive feature descriptions using linguistic and semantic patterns with contextualization and quantification modifiers. Through quantitative benchmarks and qualitative analyses, semantic regexes are shown to provide accurate, concise, and consistent descriptions compared to natural language. These descriptions enable new types of analyses, such as quantifying feature complexity across model layers and identifying model-wide patterns. User studies reveal that semantic regex descriptions assist individuals in constructing accurate mental models of LLM feature activations. Overall, semantic regexes prove to be a valuable tool for improving interpretability and understanding of LLM features. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated interpretability aims to translate large language model (LLM) features into human understandable descriptions. However, these natural language feature descriptions are often vague, inconsistent, and require manual relabeling. In response, we introduce semantic regexes, structured language descriptions of LLM features. By combining primitives that capture linguistic and semantic feature patterns with modifiers for contextualization, composition, and quantification, semantic regexes produce precise and expressive feature descriptions. Across quantitative benchmarks and qualitative analyses, we find that semantic regexes match the accuracy of natural language while yielding more concise and consistent feature descriptions. Moreover, their inherent structure affords new types of analyses, including quantifying feature complexity across layers, scaling automated interpretability from insights into individual features to model-wide patterns. Finally, in user studies, we find that semantic regex descriptions help people build accurate mental models of LLM feature activations.

<div> de-identification, linkage risks, search-based attacks, inverted index, LLM-based rewriter <br />
<br />
Summary:
This paper introduces a method to prevent search-based linkage attacks on de-identified documents while maintaining semantic integrity. The approach involves constructing an inverted index of N-grams in the document collection to efficiently identify less common N-grams. A Language Model (LLM)-based rewriter then iteratively modifies these N-grams to disrupt linkages. Experimental results on court cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in thwarting search-based attacks without altering the original content. This approach addresses the limitation of de-identification models in safeguarding against potential mapping of de-identified texts back to their sources. By proactively disrupting linkages through targeted N-gram modifications, the method enhances privacy protection while preserving the underlying meaning of the text. <div>

Abstract: While de-identification models can help conceal the identity of the individual(s) mentioned in a document, they fail to address linkage risks, defined as the potential to map the de-identified text back to its source. One straightforward way to perform such linkages is to extract phrases from the de-identified document and then check their presence in the original dataset. This paper presents a method to counter search-based linkage attacks while preserving the semantic integrity of the text. The method proceeds in two steps. We first construct an inverted index of the N-grams occurring in the document collection, making it possible to efficiently determine which N-grams appear in less than $k$ documents (either alone or in combination with other N-grams). An LLM-based rewriter is then iteratively queried to reformulate those spans until linkage is no longer possible. Experimental results on a collection of court cases show that the method is able to effectively prevent search-based linkages while remaining faithful to the original content.

<div> Keywords: stylistic text generation, diffusion models, controllable generation, attribute supervision, VAE-based encoder-decoder

Summary:
RegDiff is a new framework for controllable text generation that combines the strengths of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier guidance (CG) methods. It uses a VAE-based encoder-decoder architecture to ensure accuracy and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision for controllable text generation. By injecting attribute information only during training, RegDiff achieves efficient and effective attribute alignment without the need for a pretrained classifier during sampling. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that RegDiff outperforms existing baselines in generating stylistic texts. This approach offers a more computationally efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion, making it a promising advancement in the field of text generation.<br /><br />Summary: RegDiff is a regularized diffusion framework for controllable text generation that combines CFG and CG methods. It uses VAE-based encoder-decoder and attribute supervision for efficient and effective stylistic text generation. <div>

Abstract: Generating stylistic text with specific attributes is a key problem in controllable text generation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for both visual and textual generation. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into classifier-free guidance (CFG) and classifier guidance (CG) methods. While CFG effectively preserves semantic content, it often fails to provide effective attribute control. In contrast, CG modifies the denoising trajectory using classifier gradients, enabling better attribute alignment but incurring high computational costs during sampling and suffering from classifier generalization issues. In this work, we propose RegDiff, a regularized diffusion framework that leverages attribute features without requiring a pretrained classifier during sampling, thereby achieving controllable generation with reduced computational costs. Specifically, RegDiff employs a VAE-based encoder--decoder architecture to ensure reconstruction fidelity and a latent diffusion model trained with attribute supervision to enable controllable text generation. Attribute information is injected only during training. Experiments on five datasets spanning multiple stylistic attributes demonstrate that RegDiff outperforms strong baselines in generating stylistic texts. These results validate the effectiveness of RegDiff as an efficient solution for attribute-controllable text diffusion.

<div> Keywords: Reward models, alignment, sociodemographic biases, preferences, language models 

Summary: 
- The study focuses on reward models (RMs) used to align language models (LMs) with human preferences.
- A framework for measuring alignment of opinions captured by RMs is formalized.
- Investigations reveal that RMs exhibit sociodemographic biases and may reward harmful stereotypes.
- Prompting to steer rewards towards a target group's preferences may not fully overcome these biases.
- The findings highlight the importance of understanding and mitigating RM behavior in preference learning to avoid perpetuating social biases in language technologies. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to the alignment of language models (LMs). An RM often serves as a proxy for human preferences to guide downstream LM behavior. However, our understanding of RM behavior is limited. Our work (i) formalizes a framework for measuring the alignment of opinions captured by RMs, (ii) investigates the extent to which RMs demonstrate sociodemographic biases, and (iii) explores the effects of prompting to steer rewards towards the preferences of a target group. We study the subjective and diverse perspectives on controversial topics, which allows us to quantify RM perspectives in terms of their opinions, attitudes, and values. We show that RMs are poorly aligned with several demographic groups and can systematically reward harmful stereotypes, and steering alone is not enough to overcome these limitations. Our findings underscore the need for more careful consideration of RM behavior in model alignment during preference learning to prevent the propagation of unwanted social biases in the language technologies that we use.

<div> Virtual Labs, instructional goal-aligned question generation, Large Language Models, natural language interaction, cognitive demand<br />
<br />Summary:
This paper introduces a framework for instructional goal-aligned question generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) in Virtual Labs. The framework includes components such as instructional goal understanding, lab understanding, a question taxonomy, and the TELeR taxonomy for controlling prompt detail. Through dialogue with teachers, the framework ensures questions align with teacher intent and simulation context. The question taxonomy enhances cognitive demand and quality, while TELeR prompts improve format adherence. Evaluation of over 1,100 questions from 19 LLMs shows that larger models yield significant gains in parsability, adherence, and question quality. This framework offers a promising approach to leveraging LLMs for personalized and effective science learning in Virtual Labs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Labs offer valuable opportunities for hands-on, inquiry-based science learning, yet teachers often struggle to adapt them to fit their instructional goals. Third-party materials may not align with classroom needs, and developing custom resources can be time-consuming and difficult to scale. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing these limitations. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment framework for instructional goal-aligned question generation, enabling teachers to leverage LLMs to produce simulation-aligned, pedagogically meaningful questions through natural language interaction. The framework integrates four components: instructional goal understanding via teacher-LLM dialogue, lab understanding via knowledge unit and relationship analysis, a question taxonomy for structuring cognitive and pedagogical intent, and the TELeR taxonomy for controlling prompt detail. Early design choices were informed by a small teacher-assisted case study, while our final evaluation analyzed over 1,100 questions from 19 open-source LLMs. With goal and lab understanding grounding questions in teacher intent and simulation context, the question taxonomy elevates cognitive demand (open-ended formats and relational types raise quality by 0.29-0.39 points), and optimized TELeR prompts enhance format adherence (80% parsability, >90% adherence). Larger models yield the strongest gains: parsability +37.1%, adherence +25.7%, and average quality +0.8 Likert points.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, FinLFQA, financial applications, attribution, automatic evaluation<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inaccurate answers to long-form financial questions, known as hallucinations. To address this issue, the researchers introduce FinLFQA, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to generate accurate answers with detailed attributions in financial scenarios. FinLFQA assesses three key aspects of attribution: supporting evidence from financial reports, numerical reasoning steps, and domain-specific financial knowledge. The study includes an automatic evaluation framework covering answer and attribution quality. Experiment results indicate the importance of fine-grained metrics in distinguishing model performance, the comparable performance of end-to-end and post-hoc approaches, and the effectiveness of iterative refinement with external feedback. The findings highlight the significance of nuanced attribution generation in enhancing LLM capabilities for complex financial questions.<br />  <div>
arXiv:2510.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate to long-form questions, producing plausible yet factually incorrect answers. A common mitigation strategy is to provide attribution to LLM outputs. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on simple attribution that retrieves supporting textual evidence as references. We argue that in real-world scenarios such as financial applications, attribution goes beyond reference retrieval. We introduce FinLFQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate long-form answers to complex financial questions with reliable and nuanced attributions. FinLFQA evaluates three critical aspects of attribution through human annotations: (1) supporting evidence extracted from financial reports, (2) intermediate numerical reasoning steps, and (3) domain-specific financial knowledge that informs the reasoning process. We further provide an automatic evaluation framework covering both answer quality and attribution quality. Through extensive experiments on eight LLMs across multiple attribution-generation paradigms, we find that fine-grained metrics are important to distinguish model capabilities, that end-to-end generation achieves comparable performance to post-hoc approaches, and that iterative refinement only helps when guided by external feedback.

Summary:
The article introduces UniRST, the first unified RST-style discourse parser capable of handling 18 treebanks in 11 languages without modifying their relation inventories. Two training strategies, Multi-Head and Masked-Union, were proposed and evaluated to overcome inventory incompatibilities. The Masked-Union approach was found to be the strongest and most parameter efficient. Additionally, a simple yet effective augmentation technique was used for low-resource settings in monotreebank parsing. The unified model, UniRST, outperformed 16 out of 18 mono-treebank baselines, showcasing the benefits of a single-model, multilingual end-to-end discourse parsing across diverse resources. <div>

Abstract: We introduce UniRST, the first unified RST-style discourse parser capable of handling 18 treebanks in 11 languages without modifying their relation inventories. To overcome inventory incompatibilities, we propose and evaluate two training strategies: Multi-Head, which assigns separate relation classification layer per inventory, and Masked-Union, which enables shared parameter training through selective label masking. We first benchmark monotreebank parsing with a simple yet effective augmentation technique for low-resource settings. We then train a unified model and show that (1) the parameter efficient Masked-Union approach is also the strongest, and (2) UniRST outperforms 16 of 18 mono-treebank baselines, demonstrating the advantages of a single-model, multilingual end-to-end discourse parsing across diverse resources.

<div> math reasoning, robustness, linguistic variation, high school-level, benchmarking 

Summary: 
The study evaluates the math reasoning robustness of large language models in handling linguistic variation in high school-level math problems. A new test set, MathRobust-LV, was introduced to assess how models perform when surface details in problems are altered while maintaining the same numerical structure and answers. Unlike previous studies focusing on high-difficulty competitions like the IMO, this research emphasizes the importance of linguistic robustness in educational settings where math problems are rephrased in varied ways by instructors. Results from testing 34 models indicate that accuracy decreases when models face variations in problem details. While smaller models show a significant decline in accuracy, even stronger models experience some degradation. Frontier models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5pro demonstrate better stability. These findings reveal the fundamental challenge of linguistic variation in math reasoning and highlight vulnerabilities in current models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models excel on math benchmarks, but their math reasoning robustness to linguistic variation is underexplored. While recent work increasingly treats high-difficulty competitions like the IMO as the gold standard for evaluating reasoning, we believe in comprehensive benchmarking of high school-level math problems in real educational settings. We introduce MathRobust-LV, a test set and evaluation methodology that mirrors how instructors rephrase problems across assessments while keeping difficulty constant: we change surface details (names, contexts, variables) while preserving numerical structure and answers. In contrast to prior efforts that alter problem content or emphasize IMO-level tasks, we focus on high-school-level dataset problems at the difficulty level where models are currently deployed in educational settings: tutoring and assessment systems. In these applications, instructors rephrase identical concepts in varied ways, making linguistic robustness essential for reliable deployment. Although MATH data benchmarking is often regarded as saturated, our experiment on 34 models reveals that accuracy declines when moving from the baseline to the variants. These drops are severe for smaller models (9-11%) while stronger models also show measurable degradation. Frontier models like GPT-5, Gemini-2.5pro remain comparatively stable. Our results highlight that robustness to linguistic variation is a fundamental challenge, exposing reasoning vulnerabilities in models.

Summary:
- The study explores the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for language documentation tasks, focusing on the underresourced Yan-nhangu language.
- Fine-tuning a wav2vec2 ASR model on Yan-nhangu and comparing phonemic versus orthographic tokenization strategies show that a linguistically informed phonemic system improves performance.
- ASR is evaluated as a tool in a language documentation pipeline and found to be a viable option for underresourced languages.
- Hand-correcting ASR output is shown to be faster than hand-transcribing audio from scratch, indicating the efficiency of using ASR in language documentation.
- The study highlights the potential of ASR for linguistic research and documentation, especially for languages with limited resources and documentation efforts.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a crucial tool for linguists aiming to perform a variety of language documentation tasks. However, modern ASR systems use data-hungry transformer architectures, rendering them generally unusable for underresourced languages. We fine-tune a wav2vec2 ASR model on Yan-nhangu, a dormant Indigenous Australian language, comparing the effects of phonemic and orthographic tokenization strategies on performance. In parallel, we explore ASR's viability as a tool in a language documentation pipeline. We find that a linguistically informed phonemic tokenization system substantially improves WER and CER compared to a baseline orthographic tokenization scheme. Finally, we show that hand-correcting the output of an ASR model is much faster than hand-transcribing audio from scratch, demonstrating that ASR can work for underresourced languages.

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper explores the impact of test-time scaling (TTS) on machine translation (MT) using Reasoning Models (RMs). The study evaluates TTS on 12 RMs across various MT benchmarks in different domains, considering direct translation, forced-reasoning extrapolation, and post-editing scenarios. The results indicate that while TTS offers limited benefits for general-purpose RMs in direct translation, domain-specific fine-tuning can significantly improve translation quality by aligning reasoning processes with task requirements. It is observed that forcing a model to reason beyond its natural stopping point negatively affects translation quality. However, TTS is highly effective in post-editing, enhancing self-correction processes. Overall, the study shows that the value of inference-time computation in MT lies in specialized applications like multi-step workflows and with task-specific models rather than enhancing single-pass translation with general models. <div>

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has enhanced the performance of Reasoning Models (RMs) on various tasks such as math and coding, yet its efficacy in machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether increased inference-time computation improves translation quality. We evaluate 12 RMs across a diverse suite of MT benchmarks spanning multiple domains, examining three scenarios: direct translation, forced-reasoning extrapolation, and post-editing. Our findings show that for general-purpose RMs, TTS provides limited and inconsistent benefits for direct translation, with performance quickly plateauing. However, the effectiveness of TTS is unlocked by domain-specific fine-tuning, which aligns a model's reasoning process with task requirements, leading to consistent improvements up to an optimal, self-determined reasoning depth. We also find that forcing a model to reason beyond its natural stopping point consistently degrades translation quality. In contrast, TTS proves highly effective in a post-editing context, reliably turning self-correction into a beneficial process. These results indicate that the value of inference-time computation in MT lies not in enhancing single-pass translation with general models, but in targeted applications like multi-step, self-correction workflows and in conjunction with task-specialized models.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Webscale-RL pipeline, a data engine that generates diverse question-answer pairs from large-scale pre-training documents for Reinforcement Learning (RL) training. The Webscale-RL dataset contains 1.2 million examples across 9 domains, showing significant improvements in model performance compared to continual pre-training and data refinement baselines. RL training with the Webscale-RL dataset proves to be more efficient, achieving comparable performance with up to 100 times fewer tokens.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success through imitation learning on vast text corpora, but this paradigm creates a training-generation gap and limits robust reasoning. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL. Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the performance of continual pre-training with up to 100$\times$ fewer tokens. Our work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models.

Summary:
Bootstrapped pretraining, the reuse of a pretrained base model for further pretraining, is a cost-effective approach for training language models. However, its effectiveness diminishes when applied to overtrained base models. The study on scaling behavior reveals a predictable decrease in scaling efficiency as the number of tokens used for pretraining the base model increases. The joint dependence on first- and second-stage tokens can be accurately modeled by a simple scaling law. This saturation effect highlights a trade-off in multi-stage pretraining strategies: extensive base model pretraining leads to diminishing additional benefits from bootstrapping. These findings offer practical insights for efficient language model training and raise important considerations for reusing overtrained models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Bootstrapped pretraining, i.e., the reuse of a pretrained base model for further pretraining, such as continual pretraining or model growth, is promising at reducing the cost of training language models from scratch. However, its effectiveness remains unclear, especially when applied to overtrained base models. In this work, we empirically study the scaling behavior of bootstrapped pretraining and find that its scaling efficiency diminishes in a predictable manner: The scaling exponent with respect to second-stage pretraining tokens decreases logarithmically with the number of tokens used to pretrain the base model. The joint dependence on first- and second-stage tokens is accurately modeled by a simple scaling law. Such saturation effect reveals a fundamental trade-off in multi-stage pretraining strategies: the more extensively a model is pretrained, the less additional benefit bootstrapping provides. Our findings provide practical insights for efficient language model training and raise important considerations for the reuse of overtrained models.

Summary:
In the study, the focus is on evaluating the performance of Language Models (LMs) in realistic settings where human users interact with LM assistants in multi-turn conversations. It is found that LLMs trained to be helpful assistants do not serve as effective user simulators. Instead, User Language Models (User LMs) are introduced to better simulate human user behavior in conversations. These User LMs demonstrate improved alignment with human behavior and simulation robustness compared to existing methods. When used to simulate coding and math conversations, the performance of a strong assistant like GPT-4o drops significantly, indicating the challenges assistants face in handling the nuances of user interactions in multi-turn setups.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversations with LMs involve two participants: a human user leading the conversation, and an LM assistant responding to the user's request. To satisfy this specific role, LMs are post-trained to be helpful assistants -- optimized to produce exhaustive and well-structured responses, free of ambiguity and grammar errors. User utterances, on the other hand, are rarely perfected, with each user phrasing requests in unique ways, sometimes putting in partial effort at each turn and refining on the fly. To evaluate LM performance in realistic settings, prior work simulated users in multi-turn conversations, often prompting an LLM originally trained to be a helpful assistant to act as a user. However, we show that assistant LMs make for poor user simulators, with the surprising finding that better assistants yield worse simulators. Instead, we introduce purpose-built User Language Models (User LMs) - models post-trained to simulate human users in multi-turn conversations. Through various evaluations, we show how User LMs align better with human behavior and achieve better simulation robustness than existing simulation methods. When leveraging User LMs to simulate coding and math conversations, the performance of a strong assistant (GPT-4o) drops from 74.6% to 57.4%, confirming that more realistic simulation environments lead to assistant struggles as they fail to cope with the nuances of users in multi-turn setups.

<div> Keywords: language models, type-theoretic semantics, neuro-symbolic architecture, legal reasoning, multi-jurisdiction 

Summary:
Contemporary language models often struggle with handling the various types of meaning in their outputs, leading to issues such as hallucination and opaque compliance. The authors propose that these issues stem from a lack of type-theoretic semantics rather than data or scale limitations. They introduce Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles natural-language inputs into Montague-style logical forms with added deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. By aligning language parsing with legal reasoning, the system can provide compliance-aware guidance rather than simply censoring content. In cross-border scenarios, Savassan can parse inputs once and project outcomes across multiple legal ontologies, producing explainable decisions. The paper offers a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error, a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning, and a design that embeds typed interfaces throughout the pipeline. The authors propose an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic multi-jurisdiction suites, emphasizing the importance of compositional typing for trustworthy autonomous systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary language models are fluent yet routinely mis-handle the types of meaning their outputs entail. We argue that hallucination, brittle moderation, and opaque compliance outcomes are symptoms of missing type-theoretic semantics rather than data or scale limitations. Building on Montague's view of language as typed, compositional algebra, we recast alignment as a parsing problem: natural-language inputs must be compiled into structures that make explicit their descriptive, normative, and legal dimensions under context.
  We present Savassan, a neuro-symbolic architecture that compiles utterances into Montague-style logical forms and maps them to typed ontologies extended with deontic operators and jurisdictional contexts. Neural components extract candidate structures from unstructured inputs; symbolic components perform type checking, constraint reasoning, and cross-jurisdiction mapping to produce compliance-aware guidance rather than binary censorship. In cross-border scenarios, the system "parses once" (e.g., defect claim(product x, company y)) and projects the result into multiple legal ontologies (e.g., defamation risk in KR/JP, protected opinion in US, GDPR checks in EU), composing outcomes into a single, explainable decision.
  This paper contributes: (i) a diagnosis of hallucination as a type error; (ii) a formal Montague-ontology bridge for business/legal reasoning; and (iii) a production-oriented design that embeds typed interfaces across the pipeline. We outline an evaluation plan using legal reasoning benchmarks and synthetic multi-jurisdiction suites. Our position is that trustworthy autonomy requires compositional typing of meaning, enabling systems to reason about what is described, what is prescribed, and what incurs liability within a unified algebra of meaning.

<div> Jailbreaking, large language models, LLMs, adversarial users, defense mechanisms
Summary: 
The study examines the jailbreaking of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing how hidden layers respond to jailbreak prompts compared to benign prompts. Specifically focusing on the GPT-J and Mamba2 models, the research identifies distinct layer-wise behaviors that can be utilized for robust jailbreak detection and defense. With the increasing prevalence of conversational LLMs, the exploitation of these models through engineered prompts is a pressing concern. Despite existing defense mechanisms, attackers continue to find ways to jailbreak models. By investigating internal model representations, the study provides insights into potential strategies for enhancing model security against jailbreaking. Further research in leveraging internal model dynamics could lead to more effective defenses against adversarial users.

Abstract: Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a pressing concern with the increasing prevalence and accessibility of conversational LLMs. Adversarial users often exploit these models through carefully engineered prompts to elicit restricted or sensitive outputs, a strategy widely referred to as jailbreaking. While numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed, attackers continuously develop novel prompting techniques, and no existing model can be considered fully resistant. In this study, we investigate the jailbreak phenomenon by examining the internal representations of LLMs, with a focus on how hidden layers respond to jailbreak versus benign prompts. Specifically, we analyze the open-source LLM GPT-J and the state-space model Mamba2, presenting preliminary findings that highlight distinct layer-wise behaviors. Our results suggest promising directions for further research on leveraging internal model dynamics for robust jailbreak detection and defense.

<div> SSMs, TBMs, representation propagation, centered kernel alignment, oversmoothing <br />
Summary: <br />
State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformer-Based Models (TBMs) are compared for long-sequence processing. The study analyzes how contextual information flows through layers and tokens in both architectures. TBMs tend to homogenize token representations quickly, with diversity emerging in later layers. In contrast, SSMs maintain token uniqueness initially but converge to homogenization in deeper layers. The oversmoothing in TBMs is attributed to architectural design, while in SSMs, it mainly arises from training dynamics. These findings provide insights into the inductive biases of each architecture and can guide future model and training designs for long-context reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2510.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformer-Based Models (TBMs) for long-sequence processing, offering linear scaling and lower memory use. Yet, how contextual information flows across layers and tokens in these architectures remains understudied. We present the first unified, token- and layer-level analysis of representation propagation in SSMs and TBMs. Using centered kernel alignment, stability metrics, and probing, we characterize how representations evolve within and across layers. We find a key divergence: TBMs rapidly homogenize token representations, with diversity reemerging only in later layers, while SSMs preserve token uniqueness early but converge to homogenization deeper. Theoretical analysis and parameter randomization further reveal that oversmoothing in TBMs stems from architectural design, whereas in SSMs it arises mainly from training dynamics. These insights clarify the inductive biases of both architectures and inform future model and training designs for long-context reasoning.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, human feedback, language models, self-alignment optimization, synthetic framework

Summary:
Self-Alignment Optimization (SAO) is introduced as a framework for large language model (LLM) alignment. SAO is a fully self-synthetic approach where the LLM generates its own training data, including prompts, responses, and preferences. The model engages in persona role-play to generate diverse prompts and responses, which are then self-evaluated for preference optimization. SAO enhances the model's chat capabilities on benchmarks like AlpacaEval~2.0 while maintaining strong performance on objective tasks like question-answering and math reasoning. This self-improvement method for aligning LLMs provides a practical solution without the need for expensive human-annotated datasets or external reward models. The code for reproducing the results is available on GitHub at https://github.com/SJY8460/SAO.

arXiv:2510.06652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) relies on expensive human-annotated datasets, while Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) also incurs significant costs, requiring the collection of diverse prompts and corresponding responses, often necessitating external reward models or proprietary models like GPT-4 to annotate preference pairs. In this work, we introduce Self-Alignment Optimization (SAO), a fully self-synthetic framework for LLM alignment, where all training data, including prompts (i.e., user queries), responses, and preferences, are generated by the model itself. Specifically, SAO first instructs the LLM to engage in persona role-play and generate diverse prompts and responses, which are then self-evaluated for preference optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAO effectively enhances the model's chat capabilities on standard benchmarks like AlpacaEval~2.0, while maintaining strong performance on downstream objective tasks (e.g., question-answering, math reasoning). Our work provides a practical solution for self-improvement in aligning LLMs, and the code for reproducing our results is available at: https://github.com/SJY8460/SAO.

<div> capabilities, neural tools, ToolMem, tool selection, memory

Summary:
Agents powered by large language models and vision-language models have shown great progress in various tasks. However, traditional tools provide deterministic outputs, while neural tools operate with uncertainty. To address this, ToolMem is proposed to help agents develop memories of tool capabilities by summarizing strengths and weaknesses and storing them for future use. By utilizing ToolMem, agents can accurately predict tool performance and select the best tool for individual tasks more effectively. In evaluations with text generation and text-to-image generation tools, ToolMem-augmented agents outperformed generic agents, showing significant improvements in predicting tool performance and facilitating optimal tool selection among multiple choices. Overall, ToolMem enhances agent flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool by leveraging past interactions and knowledge of tool capabilities.

Abstract: Agents utilizing tools powered by large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse tasks across text and visual modalities. Unlike traditional tools such as calculators, which give deterministic outputs, neural tools perform uncertainly across task scenarios. While different tools for a task may excel in varied scenarios, existing agents typically rely on fixed tools, thus limiting the flexibility in selecting the most suitable tool for specific tasks. In contrast, humans snowball their understanding of the capabilities of different tools by interacting with them, and apply this knowledge to select the optimal tool when solving a future task. To build agents that similarly benefit from this process, we propose ToolMem that enables agents to develop memories of tool capabilities from previous interactions, by summarizing their strengths and weaknesses and storing them in memory; at inference, the agent can retrieve relevant entries from ToolMem, and select the best tool to solve individual tasks more accurately. We evaluate ToolMem on learning varied text generation and text-to-image generation neural tools. Compared to no-memory, generic agents, we find ToolMem-augmented agents predict tool performance 14.8% and 28.7% more accurately across text and multimodal generation scenarios. Moreover, ToolMem facilitates optimal tool selection among multiple choices by 21% and 24% absolute increases in respective scenarios.

Summary:  
PiKa introduces a data-efficient family of expert-level alignment datasets, specifically the PiKa-SFT dataset with only 30k examples. Fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base on PiKa showed better performance than models trained on larger datasets. PiKa-SFT even outperformed the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct model trained on over 10 million examples on benchmarks. Training the Qwen2.5 series on PiKa-SFT also yielded consistent gains. These results demonstrate that high-quality alignment can be achieved with significantly less data, offering a scalable path for open-source LLM alignment. The code and data are available on GitHub for further exploration and use.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a cornerstone for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness depends on high-quality instruction data. Most existing alignment datasets are either private or require costly human annotation, which limits reproducibility and scalability. Even with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), concerns about data quality remain. Moreover, it is unclear how much data is actually required to fine-tune a base model into a strong instruction-following model. Current approaches often rely on over 300k examples even at the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, yet they still underperform compared to proprietary models, creating barriers for academic and resource-limited communities. To address this gap, we introduce PiKa, a data-efficient family of expert-level alignment datasets. In particular, the PiKa-SFT dataset uses only 30k SFT examples, far fewer than state-of-the-art datasets like Magpie. Through evaluations by fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Base on PiKa and other public datasets, we show that PiKa-SFT outperforms models trained on much larger data. On AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, PiKa-SFT fine-tuning even surpasses the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct model trained on over 10 million proprietary examples. We further extend our study by training the Qwen2.5 series (0.5B to 7B) on PiKa-SFT, achieving consistent gains. These findings demonstrate that high-quality alignment can be achieved with significantly less data, offering a scalable path for open-source LLM alignment.

Abstract: We introduce an incremental summarization system for customer support agents that intelligently determines when to generate concise bullet notes during conversations, reducing agents' context-switching effort and redundant review. Our approach combines a fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model for continuous note generation with a DeBERTa-based classifier to filter trivial content. Agent edits refine the online notes generation and regularly inform offline model retraining, closing the agent edits feedback loop. Deployed in production, our system achieved a 3% reduction in case handling time compared to bulk summarization (with reductions of up to 9% in highly complex cases), alongside high agent satisfaction ratings from surveys. These results demonstrate that incremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary quality and agent productivity at scale.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, prompt engineering, natural language generation, machine translation, back-translation

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically tailored for machine translation tasks. The approach focuses on optimizing the input component, which is crucial for tasks like machine translation. By training a small-parameter model using a back-translation strategy, the method reduces training overhead for single-task optimization while still achieving high performance. Unlike existing prompt engineering methods that primarily optimize the instruction component, this approach addresses the importance of the input component in tasks like machine translation. The proposed method not only improves performance in machine translation but also shows potential for extension to other downstream tasks. This novel approach fills a gap in prompt engineering for tasks where the input component plays a more pivotal role, providing an efficient and effective solution for optimizing prompt design in language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the growing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced prompt engineering, transitioning from manual design to model-based optimization. Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components: the \textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the \textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \textit{input} component is particularly critical, while the \textit{instruction} component tends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on optimizing the \textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often requiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools. However, these approaches exhibit limited applicability for tasks like machine translation, where the \textit{input} component plays a more pivotal role. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel prompt optimization method specifically designed for machine translation tasks. The proposed approach employs a small-parameter model trained using a back-translation-based strategy, significantly reducing training overhead for single-task optimization while delivering highly effective performance. With certain adaptations, this method can also be extended to other downstream tasks.

<div> Keywords: humans, large language models, content effects, representational geometry, debiasing vectors

Summary: 
Both humans and large language models display content effects in reasoning tasks, where the plausibility of the content influences judgments of logical validity. While humans' content effects are explained by the dual-process theory, it is unclear how large language models (LLMs) exhibit these biases. In this study, researchers investigated how LLMs encode validity and plausibility concepts in their internal representations. They found that LLMs linearly represent and align these concepts in their geometry, leading to confusion between plausibility and validity. By manipulating steering vectors, they showed causal biases between plausibility and validity judgments, predicting the magnitude of content effects. The study also introduced debiasing vectors to separate these concepts, reducing content effects and enhancing reasoning accuracy. These findings contribute to understanding logical concept representation in LLMs and suggest representational interventions as a means to enhance their logical reasoning abilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both humans and large language models (LLMs) exhibit content effects: biases in which the plausibility of the semantic content of a reasoning problem influences judgments regarding its logical validity. While this phenomenon in humans is best explained by the dual-process theory of reasoning, the mechanisms behind content effects in LLMs remain unclear. In this work, we address this issue by investigating how LLMs encode the concepts of validity and plausibility within their internal representations. We show that both concepts are linearly represented and strongly aligned in representational geometry, leading models to conflate plausibility with validity. Using steering vectors, we demonstrate that plausibility vectors can causally bias validity judgements, and vice versa, and that the degree of alignment between these two concepts predicts the magnitude of behavioral content effects across models. Finally, we construct debiasing vectors that disentangle these concepts, reducing content effects and improving reasoning accuracy. Our findings advance understanding of how abstract logical concepts are represented in LLMs and highlight representational interventions as a path toward more logical systems.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach for reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language model agents to improve long-horizon multi-turn tool use tasks. By incorporating summarization-based context management into training, the proposed method allows for optimal tool-use behaviors while maintaining a compact context beyond fixed limits. The SUmmarization augmented Policy Optimization (SUPO) algorithm is presented as a framework that seamlessly integrates summarization strategies with standard language model RL infrastructures. Experimental results on interactive tasks show that SUPO significantly enhances success rates with the same or shorter context length than baselines. Additionally, SUPO demonstrates improved performance on complex searching tasks by scaling the summarization rounds at test time. This study establishes summarization-based context management as a scalable and effective approach for training RL agents beyond fixed context length limits. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language model (LLM) agents for long-horizon multi-turn tool use, where context length quickly becomes a fundamental bottleneck. Existing RL pipelines can suffer from degraded instruction following, excessive rollout costs, and most importantly, strict context limits. To address these challenges, we introduce summarization-based context management to training. In specific, it periodically compresses the tool using history by LLM-generated summaries that retain task-relevant information to keep a compact context while enabling the agent to scale beyond the fixed context window. Building on this formulation, we derive a policy gradient representation that seamlessly enables standard LLM RL infrastructures to optimize both tool-use behaviors as well as summarization strategies in an end-to-end fashion. We instantiate this framework with \underline{SU}mmarization augmented \underline{P}olicy \underline{O}ptimization (\texttt{SUPO}), an LLM RL algorithm that enables long-horizon training beyond a fixed context limit. Experiments on interactive function calling and searching tasks demonstrate that \texttt{SUPO} significantly improves the success rate while maintaining the same or even lower working context length compared to baselines. We also demonstrate that for complex searching tasks, \texttt{SUPO} can further improve the evaluation performance when scaling test-time maximum round of summarization beyond that of training time. Our results establish summarization-based context management as a principled and scalable approach for training RL agents beyond a fixed context length limit.

Summary:
Sentence embedding models are often evaluated using static benchmarks, leading to inflated performance metrics. The Paraphrasing Text Embedding Benchmark (PTEB) introduces a dynamic evaluation protocol that generates meaning-preserving paraphrases at runtime. By utilizing a cost-efficient method based on semantic textual similarity gold ratings, the study demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can produce diverse token-based but semantically equivalent paraphrases. The research shows that changes in token space affect the performance of sentence encoders even when semantics remain constant. Furthermore, smaller models are not disproportionately affected compared to larger ones. The results are statistically reliable across multiple runs and extend to multilingual datasets in various languages. This study proposes a new evaluation paradigm for natural language processing, advocating for dynamic and stochastic evaluation methods that leverage computational resources at evaluation time. 

<br /><br />Summary: Sentence embedding models are evaluated using static benchmarks such as the MTEB, leading to potentially inflated metrics. The PTEB introduces a dynamic evaluation protocol that generates paraphrases at runtime and demonstrates the impact of token diversity on model performance. Smaller models are not disproportionately affected, highlighting the importance of dynamic evaluation protocols. The study extends to multilingual datasets, proposing a paradigm shift in NLP evaluation towards dynamic and stochastic methods. <div>
arXiv:2510.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluations of sentence embedding models typically rely on static test beds such as the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported performance and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in semantic textual similarity gold ratings, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but semantically preserving, paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results are statistically robust over multiple runs and we extended our experiments to 3 multilingual datasets covering 10 languages. More generally, we aim to propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static, pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation leveraging eval-time compute.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, information retrieval, token optimization, ranking effectiveness, linguistic naturalness

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are commonly used in information retrieval, but their ranking behavior can be influenced by small prompts. Rank Anything First (RAF) is a method that crafts textual perturbations to consistently boost the rank of a target item in LLM-generated rankings. RAF uses a two-stage token optimization approach, guided by dual objectives of maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic naturalness. Experimental results show that RAF significantly improves the rank of target items using natural language, with greater robustness compared to existing methods. This vulnerability highlights the potential for adversarial manipulation of LLM-based reranking systems, raising concerns about the trustworthiness and robustness of modern retrieval systems. The RAF code is available at: https://github.com/glad-lab/RAF.

arXiv:2510.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as rerankers in information retrieval, yet their ranking behavior can be steered by small, natural-sounding prompts. To expose this vulnerability, we present Rank Anything First (RAF), a two-stage token optimization method that crafts concise textual perturbations to consistently promote a target item in LLM-generated rankings while remaining hard to detect. Stage 1 uses Greedy Coordinate Gradient to shortlist candidate tokens at the current position by combining the gradient of the rank-target with a readability score; Stage 2 evaluates those candidates under exact ranking and readability losses using an entropy-based dynamic weighting scheme, and selects a token via temperature-controlled sampling. RAF generates ranking-promoting prompts token-by-token, guided by dual objectives: maximizing ranking effectiveness and preserving linguistic naturalness. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that RAF significantly boosts the rank of target items using naturalistic language, with greater robustness than existing methods in both promoting target items and maintaining naturalness. These findings underscore a critical security implication: LLM-based reranking is inherently susceptible to adversarial manipulation, raising new challenges for the trustworthiness and robustness of modern retrieval systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/glad-lab/RAF.

Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is crucial, given the substantial resources required for their training. Consequently, there is an urgent need for both model owners and third parties to determine whether a suspect LLM is trained from scratch or derived from an existing base model. However, the intensive post-training processes that models typically undergo-such as supervised fine-tuning, extensive continued pretraining, reinforcement learning, multi-modal extension, pruning, and upcycling-pose significant challenges to reliable identification. In this work, we propose a training-free fingerprinting method based on weight matrices. We leverage the Linear Assignment Problem (LAP) and an unbiased Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to neutralize the effects of parameter manipulations, yielding a highly robust and high-fidelity similarity metric. On a comprehensive testbed of 60 positive and 90 negative model pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional robustness against all six aforementioned post-training categories while exhibiting a near-zero risk of false positives. By achieving perfect scores on all classification metrics, our approach establishes a strong basis for reliable model lineage verification. Moreover, the entire computation completes within 30s on an NVIDIA 3090 GPU. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/AWM.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free and label-free method for short text clustering that can be used on top of any existing embedder. In the context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning, but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world scenarios than existing clustering methods.

<div> Evaluation Metrics, Grammatical Error Correction, Fluency-based Multi-reference Evaluation, GLEU, Aggregation Strategies <br />
Summary: The article introduces a new framework for evaluating grammatical error correction that emphasizes the diversity of valid human corrections. Existing evaluation frameworks often privilege a single reference and rely on rigid alignments between system and reference edits, limiting their applicability in multilingual and generative settings. The proposed framework, based on fluency-based multi-reference evaluation, views n-gram similarity as an aggregation problem over multiple legitimate corrections. Through the instantiation of GLEU using four different aggregation strategies, the study shows that these strategies capture complementary aspects of fluency and coverage. Empirical results on various language corpora such as Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese demonstrate that the framework allows for the incorporation of linguistic diversity without penalizing legitimate variation. The framework provides a principled, fluency-oriented approach to multi-reference evaluation in grammatical error correction. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Evaluating grammatical error correction requires metrics that reflect the diversity of valid human corrections rather than privileging a single reference. Existing frameworks, largely edit-based and English-centric, rely on rigid alignments between system and reference edits, limiting their applicability in multilingual and generative settings. This paper introduces a formal framework for \textit{fluency-based multi-reference evaluation}, framing $n$-gram similarity as an aggregation problem over multiple legitimate corrections. Within this formulation, we instantiate GLEU through four aggregation strategies--\textsc{select-best}, \textsc{simple-average}, \textsc{weighted-average}, and \textsc{merged-counts}--and analyze their properties of boundedness, monotonicity, and sensitivity to reference variation. Empirical results on Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese corpora show that these strategies capture complementary aspects of fluency and coverage. The framework unifies multi-reference evaluation into a principled, fluency-oriented approach that incorporates linguistic diversity without penalizing legitimate variation.

Summary: 
The study introduces a strategy to optimize the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by deploying a lightweight regulation that switches the model on and off during inference. This approach aims to prevent overthinking and reduce resource wastage without the need for multiple models. By selectively unlearning from the LRM at inference and adjusting reasoning through low-rank projections, the proposed strategy effectively scales down computation while preserving reasoning ability. The analysis of cumulative energy of singular values helps identify the optimal projections for adjusting reasoning levels. This superposed deployment strategy offers a cost-effective solution to enhance the efficiency of LRMs in structured tasks, addressing performance degradation and resource constraints commonly associated with these models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel in structured tasks by emulating deliberate human reasoning but often suffer from overthinking, degrading performance and wasting resources. One possible baseline is to deploy both LLM and LRM, then route input by predicting whether it requires reasoning and may cause overthinking. However, deploying multiple models can be costly or impractical. We propose a superposed deployment strategy with a lightweight, training-free regulation to optimize inference by switching one model on and off. Instead of routing, we selectively unlearn from LRM at inference, scaling down computation while preserving reasoning. By analyzing the cumulative energy of singular values, we identify optimal low-rank projections to adjust reasoning just right.

Summary: 
The article introduces an adaptive, multi-paradigm neuro-symbolic inference framework that identifies formal reasoning strategies from natural language problems and dynamically selects specialized formal logical solvers. Large language models (LLMs) effectively predict necessary reasoning strategies with over 90% accuracy, leading to outperformance of GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1 by 27% and 6%, respectively. Adaptive reasoning positively impacts pure LLM methods, improving zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT settings with GPT-4o by 10%, 5%, and 6%. Smaller models struggle with adaptive reasoning but show improvement through post-training. Overall, the work establishes foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic reasoning, paving the way for unified material and formal inferences on diverse reasoning challenges. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic NLP methods aim to leverage the complementary strengths of large language models and formal logical solvers. However, current approaches are mostly static in nature, i.e., the integration of a target solver is predetermined at design time, hindering the ability to employ diverse formal inference strategies. To address this, we introduce an adaptive, multi-paradigm, neuro-symbolic inference framework that: (1) automatically identifies formal reasoning strategies from problems expressed in natural language; and (2) dynamically selects and applies specialized formal logical solvers via autoformalization interfaces. Extensive experiments on individual and multi-paradigm reasoning tasks support the following conclusions: LLMs are effective at predicting the necessary formal reasoning strategies with an accuracy above 90 percent. This enables flexible integration with formal logical solvers, resulting in our framework outperforming competing baselines by 27 percent and 6 percent compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Moreover, adaptive reasoning can even positively impact pure LLM methods, yielding gains of 10, 5, and 6 percent on zero-shot, CoT, and symbolic CoT settings with GPT-4o. Finally, although smaller models struggle with adaptive neuro-symbolic reasoning, post-training offers a viable path to improvement. Overall, this work establishes the foundations for adaptive LLM-symbolic reasoning, offering a path forward for unifying material and formal inferences on heterogeneous reasoning challenges.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on measuring and systematizing knowledge extracted from Large Language Models (LLMs) using miniGPTKBs, domain-specific subcrawls.
- Analysis of termination, reproducibility, and robustness of knowledge materialization across different metrics and variations shows high termination rates influenced by the model, mixed reproducibility, and varying robustness.
- Results indicate that LLM knowledge materialization can reliably surface core knowledge but also reveal limitations in reproducibility and robustness.
- Experimentation with different perturbation types shows high robustness for seeds and temperature variations but lower robustness for languages and models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, yet measuring and systematizing this knowledge remains challenging. Converting it into structured format, for example through recursive extraction approaches such as the GPTKB methodology (Hu et al., 2025b), is still underexplored. Key open questions include whether such extraction can terminate, whether its outputs are reproducible, and how robust they are to variations. We systematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs (domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility, and robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity, and semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language, randomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment, and finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though model-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and models. These results suggest that LLM knowledge materialization can reliably surface core knowledge, while also revealing important limitations.

<div> Keywords: large language models, role-playing tasks, benchmark builder, evaluation, reasoning capabilities <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces FURINA-Builder, a pipeline for creating customizable role-playing benchmarks to evaluate large language models in diverse scenarios. It constructs dialogues between test characters and others from a character-scene pool, utilizing an LLM judge for evaluation. The resulting FURINA-Bench benchmark includes established and synthesized test characters assessed based on specific criteria. Evaluation of LLMs shows o3 and DeepSeek-R1 as top performers in English and Chinese RP tasks. Established characters consistently outperform synthesized ones, with reasoning LLMs showing improved performance but increased hallucinations. A trade-off between RP performance and reliability is observed, with a Pareto frontier across all LLMs. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of FURINA-Builder in creating versatile RP benchmarks and the challenges posed by the FURINA-Bench benchmark. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.06800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in role-playing (RP) tasks, existing benchmarks quickly become obsolete due to their narrow scope, outdated interaction paradigms, and limited adaptability across diverse application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FURINA-Builder, a novel multi-agent collaboration pipeline that automatically constructs fully customizable RP benchmarks at any scale. It enables evaluation of arbitrary characters across diverse scenarios and prompt formats, as the first benchmark builder in RP area for adaptable assessment. FURINA-Builder simulates dialogues between a test character and other characters drawn from a well-constructed character-scene pool, while an LLM judge selects fine-grained evaluation dimensions and adjusts the test character's responses into final test utterances. Using this pipeline, we build FURINA-Bench, a new comprehensive role-playing benchmark featuring both established and synthesized test characters, each assessed with dimension-specific evaluation criteria. Human evaluation and preliminary separability analysis justify our pipeline and benchmark design. We conduct extensive evaluations of cutting-edge LLMs and find that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 achieve the best performance on English and Chinese RP tasks, respectively. Across all models, established characters consistently outperform synthesized ones, with reasoning capabilities further amplifying this disparity. Interestingly, we observe that model scale does not monotonically reduce hallucinations. More critically, for reasoning LLMs, we uncover a novel trade-off: reasoning improves RP performance but simultaneously increases RP hallucinations. This trade-off extends to a broader Pareto frontier between RP performance and reliability for all LLMs. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FURINA-Builder and the challenge posed by FURINA-Bench.

Abstract: The generative plagiarism detection task at PAN 2025 aims at identifying automatically generated textual plagiarism in scientific articles and aligning them with their respective sources. We created a novel large-scale dataset of automatically generated plagiarism using three large language models: Llama, DeepSeek-R1, and Mistral. In this task overview paper, we outline the creation of this dataset, summarize and compare the results of all participants and four baselines, and evaluate the results on the last plagiarism detection task from PAN 2015 in order to interpret the robustness of the proposed approaches. We found that the current iteration does not invite a large variety of approaches as naive semantic similarity approaches based on embedding vectors provide promising results of up to 0.8 recall and 0.5 precision. In contrast, most of these approaches underperform significantly on the 2015 dataset, indicating a lack in generalizability.

Abstract: The Circuit Localization track of the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) evaluates methods for localizing circuits within large language models (LLMs), i.e., subnetworks responsible for specific task behaviors. In this work, we investigate whether ensembling two or more circuit localization methods can improve performance. We explore two variants: parallel and sequential ensembling. In parallel ensembling, we combine attribution scores assigned to each edge by different methods-e.g., by averaging or taking the minimum or maximum value. In the sequential ensemble, we use edge attribution scores obtained via EAP-IG as a warm start for a more expensive but more precise circuit identification method, namely edge pruning. We observe that both approaches yield notable gains on the benchmark metrics, leading to a more precise circuit identification approach. Finally, we find that taking a parallel ensemble over various methods, including the sequential ensemble, achieves the best results. We evaluate our approach in the BlackboxNLP 2025 MIB Shared Task, comparing ensemble scores to official baselines across multiple model-task combinations.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models have demonstrated strong capabilities, but their reliance on live API access creates scalability and reliability challenges during training and deployment. We propose MTR, a simulation-first training framework for tool-augmented reasoning. Instead of relying on live APIs, MTR learns from complete ReAct traces with schema-validated, simulated observations. Our approach operates through a multi-agent architecture where a ToolMaker generates task-specific, OpenAI-compatible tool interfaces, an AutoAgent produces structured think-act-observe sequences, and a ToolActor simulates realistic responses. Training proceeds in two stages: Stage-1 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) teaches 'trace grammar' from complete reasoning sequences; Stage-2 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) optimizes strategy with a composite trace reward that balances answer correctness and internal consistency. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, Bamboogle), MTR attains competitive Exact Match (EM) scores to live-API systems and excels on reasoning-intensive tasks, suggesting that effective tool reasoning can be learned from structured traces without live interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically developed through large-scale pre-training followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Recent advances highlight the importance of an intermediate mid-training stage, where models undergo multiple annealing-style phases that refine data quality, adapt optimization schedules, and extend context length. This stage mitigates diminishing returns from noisy tokens, stabilizes convergence, and expands model capability in late training. Its effectiveness can be explained through gradient noise scale, the information bottleneck, and curriculum learning, which together promote generalization and abstraction. Despite widespread use in state-of-the-art systems, there has been no prior survey of mid-training as a unified paradigm. We introduce the first taxonomy of LLM mid-training spanning data distribution, learning-rate scheduling, and long-context extension. We distill practical insights, compile evaluation benchmarks, and report gains to enable structured comparisons across models. We also identify open challenges and propose avenues for future research and practice.

<title>GAMBIT+: A Challenge Set for Evaluating Gender Bias in Machine Translation Quality Estimation Metrics</title>

Abstract: Gender bias in machine translation (MT) systems has been extensively documented, but bias in automatic quality estimation (QE) metrics remains comparatively underexplored. Existing studies suggest that QE metrics can also exhibit gender bias, yet most analyses are limited by small datasets, narrow occupational coverage, and restricted language variety. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale challenge set specifically designed to probe the behavior of QE metrics when evaluating translations containing gender-ambiguous occupational terms. Building on the GAMBIT corpus of English texts with gender-ambiguous occupations, we extend coverage to three source languages that are genderless or natural-gendered, and eleven target languages with grammatical gender, resulting in 33 source-target language pairs. Each source text is paired with two target versions differing only in the grammatical gender of the occupational term(s) (masculine vs. feminine), with all dependent grammatical elements adjusted accordingly. An unbiased QE metric should assign equal or near-equal scores to both versions. The dataset's scale, breadth, and fully parallel design, where the same set of texts is aligned across all languages, enables fine-grained bias analysis by occupation and systematic comparisons across languages.

<title>SID: Multi-LLM Debate Driven by Self Signals</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse application domains. Recent work has explored Multi-LLM Agent Debate (MAD) as a way to enhance performance by enabling multiple LLMs to discuss and refine responses iteratively. Nevertheless, existing MAD methods predominantly focus on utilizing external structures, such as debate graphs, using LLM-as-a-Judge, while neglecting the application of self signals, such as token logits and attention, that arise during generation. This omission leads to redundant computation and potential performance degradation. In this paper, we shift the focus to the self signals of multi-LLM debate and introduce a Self-Signals Driven Multi-LLM Debate (SID), which leverages two types of self-signals: model-level confidence and token-level semantic focus, to adaptively guide the debate process. Our approach enables high-confidence agents to exit early at the model level and compress the redundant debate contents based on the attention mechanism. We evaluate our method on various LLMs and Multimodal LLMs across multiple challenging benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing MAD techniques in accuracy but also reduces token consumption, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing self signals in enhancing both the performance and efficiency of multi-agent debate systems. Our code will be available at~\href{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}{\texttt{https://github.com/xuhang2019/SID}}.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as strong contenders in machine translation.Yet, they still struggle to adequately handle discourse phenomena, such as pronoun resolution and lexical cohesion at the document level. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the discourse phenomena performance of LLMs in context-aware translation. We demonstrate that discourse knowledge is encoded within LLMs and propose the use of quality-aware decoding (QAD) to effectively extract this knowledge, showcasing its superiority over other decoding approaches through comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate that QAD enhances the semantic richness of translations and aligns them more closely with human preferences.

<title>$\lambda$-GRPO: Unifying the GRPO Frameworks with Learnable Token Preferences</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been the dominant approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has simplified this paradigm by replacing the reward and value models with rule-based verifiers. A prominent example is Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO inherently suffers from a length bias, since the same advantage is uniformly assigned to all tokens of a response. As a result, longer responses distribute the reward over more tokens and thus contribute disproportionately to gradient updates. Several variants, such as DAPO and Dr. GRPO, modify the token-level aggregation of the loss, yet these methods remain heuristic and offer limited interpretability regarding their implicit token preferences. In this work, we explore the possibility of allowing the model to learn its own token preference during optimization. We unify existing frameworks under a single formulation and introduce a learnable parameter $\lambda$ that adaptively controls token-level weighting. We use $\lambda$-GRPO to denote our method, and we find that $\lambda$-GRPO achieves consistent improvements over vanilla GRPO and DAPO on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. On Qwen2.5 models with 1.5B, 3B, and 7B parameters, $\lambda$-GRPO improves average accuracy by $+1.9\%$, $+1.0\%$, and $+1.7\%$ compared to GRPO, respectively. Importantly, these gains come without any modifications to the training data or additional computational cost, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of learning token preferences.

Abstract: Metadata plays a critical role in indexing, documenting, and analyzing scientific literature, yet extracting it accurately and efficiently remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches often rely on rule-based or task-specific models, which struggle to generalize across domains and schema variations. In this paper, we present MeXtract, a family of lightweight language models designed for metadata extraction from scientific papers. The models, ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters, are built by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 counterparts. In their size family, MeXtract achieves state-of-the-art performance on metadata extraction on the MOLE benchmark. To further support evaluation, we extend the MOLE benchmark to incorporate model-specific metadata, providing an out-of-domain challenging subset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning on a given schema not only yields high accuracy but also transfers effectively to unseen schemas, demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of our approach. We release all the code, datasets, and models openly for the research community.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in aligning large language model (LLM) with human preferences. As real-world applications increasingly involve long history trajectories, e.g., LLM agent, it becomes indispensable to evaluate whether a model's responses are not only high-quality but also grounded in and consistent with the provided context. Yet, current RMs remain confined to short-context settings and primarily focus on response-level attributes (e.g., safety or helpfulness), while largely neglecting the critical dimension of long context-response consistency. In this work, we introduce Long-RewardBench, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context RM evaluation, featuring both Pairwise Comparison and Best-of-N tasks. Our preliminary study reveals that even state-of-the-art generative RMs exhibit significant fragility in long-context scenarios, failing to maintain context-aware preference judgments. Motivated by the analysis of failure patterns observed in model outputs, we propose a general multi-stage training strategy that effectively scales arbitrary models into robust Long-context RMs (LongRMs). Experiments show that our approach not only substantially improves performance on long-context evaluation but also preserves strong short-context capability. Notably, our 8B LongRM outperforms much larger 70B-scale baselines and matches the performance of the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

<title>SHANKS: Simultaneous Hearing and Thinking for Spoken Language Models</title>

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction, where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received, generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall, SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at https://d223302.github.io/SHANKS/

Abstract: Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form English, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR Leaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard comparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including dedicated multilingual and long-form tracks. We standardize text normalization and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription, Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All code and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible evaluation.

Abstract: Math word problems (MWPs) are critical K-12 educational tools, and customizing them to students' interests and ability levels can increase learning outcomes. However, teachers struggle to find time to customize MWPs for each student given large class sizes and increasing burnout. We propose that LLMs can support math education by generating MWPs customized to student interests and math education standards. To this end, we use a joint human expert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and closed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for standards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by using it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and more capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a text classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed baselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar to human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by conducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school students, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to human-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs.

<title>Probing Social Identity Bias in Chinese LLMs with Gendered Pronouns and Social Groups</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in user-facing applications, raising concerns about their potential to reflect and amplify social biases. We investigate social identity framing in Chinese LLMs using Mandarin-specific prompts across ten representative Chinese LLMs, evaluating responses to ingroup ("We") and outgroup ("They") framings, and extending the setting to 240 social groups salient in the Chinese context. To complement controlled experiments, we further analyze Chinese-language conversations from a corpus of real interactions between users and chatbots. Across models, we observe systematic ingroup-positive and outgroup-negative tendencies, which are not confined to synthetic prompts but also appear in naturalistic dialogue, indicating that bias dynamics might strengthen in real interactions. Our study provides a language-aware evaluation framework for Chinese LLMs, demonstrating that social identity biases documented in English generalize cross-linguistically and intensify in user-facing contexts.

<title>Towards Reliable Retrieval in RAG Systems for Large Legal Datasets</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06999</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) for legal applications, but its reliability is critically dependent on the accuracy of the retrieval step. This is particularly challenging in the legal domain, where large databases of structurally similar documents often cause retrieval systems to fail. In this paper, we address this challenge by first identifying and quantifying a critical failure mode we term Document-Level Retrieval Mismatch (DRM), where the retriever selects information from entirely incorrect source documents. To mitigate DRM, we investigate a simple and computationally efficient technique which we refer to as Summary-Augmented Chunking (SAC). This method enhances each text chunk with a document-level synthetic summary, thereby injecting crucial global context that would otherwise be lost during a standard chunking process. Our experiments on a diverse set of legal information retrieval tasks show that SAC greatly reduces DRM and, consequently, also improves text-level retrieval precision and recall. Interestingly, we find that a generic summarization strategy outperforms an approach that incorporates legal expert domain knowledge to target specific legal elements. Our work provides evidence that this practical, scalable, and easily integrable technique enhances the reliability of RAG systems when applied to large-scale legal document datasets.

<title>Pragyaan: Designing and Curating High-Quality Cultural Post-Training Datasets for Indian Languages</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07000</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the availability of high-quality post-training data, particularly instruction-tuning and preference-based examples. Existing open-source datasets, however, often lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and suffer from task diversity gaps that are especially pronounced for Indian languages. We introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that combines translations with synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training data. Using this pipeline, we curate two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and Pragyaan-Align (100K) across 10 Indian languages covering 13 broad and 56 sub-categories, leveraging 57 diverse datasets. Our dataset protocol incorporates several often-overlooked dimensions and emphasize task diversity, multi-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and preservation of cultural nuance, providing a foundation for more inclusive and effective multilingual LLMs.

<title>Native Hybrid Attention for Efficient Sequence Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07019</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers excel at sequence modeling but face quadratic complexity, while linear attention offers improved efficiency but often compromises recall accuracy over long contexts. In this work, we introduce Native Hybrid Attention (NHA), a novel hybrid architecture of linear and full attention that integrates both intra \& inter-layer hybridization into a unified layer design. NHA maintains long-term context in key-value slots updated by a linear RNN, and augments them with short-term tokens from a sliding window. A single \texttt{softmax attention} operation is then applied over all keys and values, enabling per-token and per-head context-dependent weighting without requiring additional fusion parameters. The inter-layer behavior is controlled through a single hyperparameter, the sliding window size, which allows smooth adjustment between purely linear and full attention while keeping all layers structurally uniform. Experimental results show that NHA surpasses Transformers and other hybrid baselines on recall-intensive and commonsense reasoning tasks. Furthermore, pretrained LLMs can be structurally hybridized with NHA, achieving competitive accuracy while delivering significant efficiency gains. Code is available at https://github.com/JusenD/NHA.

Abstract: LLMs are remarkable artifacts that have revolutionized a range of NLP and AI tasks. A significant contributor is their factual knowledge, which, to date, remains poorly understood, and is usually analyzed from biased samples. In this paper, we take a deep tour into the factual knowledge (or beliefs) of a frontier LLM, based on GPTKB v1.5 (Hu et al., 2025a), a recursively elicited set of 100 million beliefs of one of the strongest currently available frontier LLMs, GPT-4.1. We find that the models' factual knowledge differs quite significantly from established knowledge bases, and that its accuracy is significantly lower than indicated by previous benchmarks. We also find that inconsistency, ambiguity and hallucinations are major issues, shedding light on future research opportunities concerning factual LLM knowledge.

arXiv:2510.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching (CSW), the alternation of languages and scripts within a single utterance, remains a fundamental challenge for multiling ual NLP, even amidst the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs). Most LLMs still struggle with mixed-language inputs, limited CSW datasets, and evaluation biases, hindering deployment in multilingual societies. This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of CSW-aware LLM research, reviewing \total{unique_references} studies spanning five research areas, 12 NLP tasks, 30+ datasets, and 80+ languages. We classify recent advances by architecture, training strategy, and evaluation methodology, outlining how LLMs have reshaped CSW modeling and what challenges persist. The paper concludes with a roadmap emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, fair evaluation, and linguistically grounded models to achieve truly multilingual intelligence.

<title>Search-R3: Unifying Reasoning and Embedding Generation in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been underutilized for retrieval tasks. We present Search-R3, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by adapting LLMs to generate search embeddings as a direct output of their reasoning process. Our approach exploits LLMs' chain-of-thought capabilities, allowing them to produce more effective embeddings by reasoning step-by-step through complex semantic analyses. We implement this through three complementary mechanisms. (1) a supervised learning stage enables the model's ability to produce quality embeddings, (2) a reinforcement learning (RL) methodology that optimizes embedding generation alongside reasoning, and (3) a specialized RL environment that efficiently handles evolving embedding representations without requiring complete corpus re-encoding at each training iteration. Our extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Search-R3 significantly outperforms prior methods by unifying the reasoning and embedding generation processes. This integrated post-training approach represents a substantial advancement in handling complex knowledge-intensive tasks that require both sophisticated reasoning and effective information retrieval.

<title>Does Local News Stay Local?: Online Content Shifts in Sinclair-Acquired Stations</title>

Abstract: Local news stations are often considered to be reliable sources of non-politicized information, particularly local concerns that residents care about. Because these stations are trusted news sources, viewers are particularly susceptible to the information they report. The Sinclair Broadcast group is a broadcasting company that has acquired many local news stations in the last decade. We investigate the effects of local news stations being acquired by Sinclair: how does coverage change? We use computational methods to investigate changes in internet content put out by local news stations before and after being acquired by Sinclair and in comparison to national news outlets. We find that there is clear evidence that local news stations report more frequently on national news at the expense of local topics, and that their coverage of polarizing national topics increases.

<title>Revisiting Metric Reliability for Fine-grained Evaluation of Machine Translation and Summarization in Indian Languages</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07061</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While automatic metrics drive progress in Machine Translation (MT) and Text Summarization (TS), existing metrics have been developed and validated almost exclusively for English and other high-resource languages. This narrow focus leaves Indian languages, spoken by over 1.5 billion people, largely overlooked, casting doubt on the universality of current evaluation practices. To address this gap, we introduce ITEM, a large-scale benchmark that systematically evaluates the alignment of 26 automatic metrics with human judgments across six major Indian languages, enriched with fine-grained annotations. Our extensive evaluation, covering agreement with human judgments, sensitivity to outliers, language-specific reliability, inter-metric correlations, and resilience to controlled perturbations, reveals four central findings: (1) LLM-based evaluators show the strongest alignment with human judgments at both segment and system levels; (2) outliers exert a significant impact on metric-human agreement; (3) in TS, metrics are more effective at capturing content fidelity, whereas in MT, they better reflect fluency; and (4) metrics differ in their robustness and sensitivity when subjected to diverse perturbations. Collectively, these findings offer critical guidance for advancing metric design and evaluation in Indian languages.

<title>LuxInstruct: A Cross-Lingual Instruction Tuning Dataset For Luxembourgish</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07074</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a key technique for enhancing the performance of large language models, enabling them to better follow human prompts. However, low-resource languages such as Luxembourgish face severe limitations due to the lack of high-quality instruction datasets. Traditional reliance on machine translation often introduces semantic misalignment and cultural inaccuracies. In this work, we address these challenges by creating a cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset for Luxembourgish, without resorting to machine-generated translations into it. Instead, by leveraging aligned data from English, French, and German, we build a high-quality dataset that preserves linguistic and cultural nuances. We provide evidence that cross-lingual instruction tuning not only improves representational alignment across languages but also the model's generative capabilities in Luxembourgish. This highlights how cross-lingual data curation can avoid the common pitfalls of machine-translated data and directly benefit low-resource language development.

<title>Accelerating Diffusion LLM Inference via Local Determinism Propagation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07081</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) represent a significant advancement in text generation, offering parallel token decoding capabilities. However, existing open-source implementations suffer from quality-speed trade-offs that impede their practical deployment. Conservative sampling strategies typically decode only the most confident token per step to ensure quality (i.e., greedy decoding), at the cost of inference efficiency due to repeated redundant refinement iterations--a phenomenon we term delayed decoding. Through systematic analysis of dLLM decoding dynamics, we characterize this delayed decoding behavior and propose a training-free adaptive parallel decoding strategy, named LocalLeap, to address these inefficiencies. LocalLeap is built on two fundamental empirical principles: local determinism propagation centered on high-confidence anchors and progressive spatial consistency decay. By applying these principles, LocalLeap identifies anchors and performs localized relaxed parallel decoding within bounded neighborhoods, achieving substantial inference step reduction through early commitment of already-determined tokens without compromising output quality. Comprehensive evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates that LocalLeap achieves 6.94$\times$ throughput improvements and reduces decoding steps to just 14.2\% of the original requirement, achieving these gains with negligible performance impact. The source codes are available at: https://github.com/friedrichor/LocalLeap.

<title>All Claims Are Equal, but Some Claims Are More Equal Than Others: Importance-Sensitive Factuality Evaluation of LLM Generations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07083</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07083</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the factuality of large language model (LLM) responses treat all claims as equally important. This results in misleading evaluations when vital information is missing or incorrect as it receives the same weight as peripheral details, raising the question: how can we reliably detect such differences when there are errors in key information? Current approaches that measure factuality tend to be insensitive to omitted or false key information. To investigate this lack of sensitivity, we construct VITALERRORS, a benchmark of 6,733 queries with minimally altered LLM responses designed to omit or falsify key information. Using this dataset, we demonstrate the insensitivities of existing evaluation metrics to key information errors. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a set of metrics that provide greater sensitivity in measuring the factuality of responses by incorporating the relevance and importance of claims with respect to the query. Our analysis demonstrates that VITAL metrics more reliably detect errors in key information than previous methods. Our dataset, metrics, and analysis provide a foundation for more accurate and robust assessment of LLM factuality.

<title>Making Machines Sound Sarcastic: LLM-Enhanced and Retrieval-Guided Sarcastic Speech Synthesis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant challenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic, contextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has focused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach combines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture pragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic exemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which provide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within a VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually appropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations, yielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and downstream sarcasm detection.

arXiv:2510.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table Visual Question Answering (Table VQA) is typically addressed by large vision-language models (VLMs). While such models can answer directly from images, they often miss fine-grained details unless scaled to very large sizes, which are computationally prohibitive, especially for mobile deployment. A lighter alternative is to have a small VLM perform OCR and then use a large language model (LLM) to reason over structured outputs such as Markdown tables. However, these representations are not naturally optimized for LLMs and still introduce substantial errors. We propose TALENT (Table VQA via Augmented Language-Enhanced Natural-text Transcription), a lightweight framework that leverages dual representations of tables. TALENT prompts a small VLM to produce both OCR text and natural language narration, then combines them with the question for reasoning by an LLM. This reframes Table VQA as an LLM-centric multimodal reasoning task, where the VLM serves as a perception-narration module rather than a monolithic solver. Additionally, we construct ReTabVQA, a more challenging Table VQA dataset requiring multi-step quantitative reasoning over table images. Experiments show that TALENT enables a small VLM-LLM combination to match or surpass a single large VLM at significantly lower computational cost on both public datasets and ReTabVQA.

Abstract: Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks involve subjectivity, ambiguity, or legitimate disagreement between annotators. In this paper, we outline our system for modeling human variation. Our system leverages language models' (LLMs) in-context learning abilities, along with a two-step meta-learning training procedure for 1) post-training on many datasets requiring in-context learning and 2) specializing the model via in-context meta-learning to the particular data distribution of interest. We also evaluate the performance of our system submission to the Learning With Disagreements (LeWiDi) competition, where it was the overall winner on both tasks. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to measure the importance of each system component. We find that including rater examples in-context is crucial for our system's performance, dataset-specific fine-tuning is helpful on the larger datasets, post-training on other in-context datasets is helpful on one of the competition datasets, and that performance improves with model scale.

<title>TRIM: Token-wise Attention-Derived Saliency for Data-Efficient Instruction Tuning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and commonly relies on large, diverse corpora. However, small, high-quality subsets, known as coresets, can deliver comparable or superior results, though curating them remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse, sample-level signals like gradients, an approach that is computationally expensive and overlooks fine-grained features. To address this, we introduce TRIM (Token Relevance via Interpretable Multi-layer Attention), a forward-only, token-centric framework. Instead of using gradients, TRIM operates by matching underlying representational patterns identified via attention-based "fingerprints" from a handful of target samples. Such an approach makes TRIM highly efficient and uniquely sensitive to the structural features that define a task. Coresets selected by our method consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 9% on downstream tasks and even surpass the performance of full-data fine-tuning in some settings. By avoiding expensive backward passes, TRIM achieves this at a fraction of the computational cost. These findings establish TRIM as a scalable and efficient alternative for building high-quality instruction-tuning datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that fluently converse with humans are a reality - but do LLMs experience human-like processing difficulties? We systematically compare human and LLM sentence comprehension across seven challenging linguistic structures. We collect sentence comprehension data from humans and five families of state-of-the-art LLMs, varying in size and training procedure in a unified experimental framework. Our results show LLMs overall struggle on the target structures, but especially on garden path (GP) sentences. Indeed, while the strongest models achieve near perfect accuracy on non-GP structures (93.7% for GPT-5), they struggle on GP structures (46.8% for GPT-5). Additionally, when ranking structures based on average performance, rank correlation between humans and models increases with parameter count. For each target structure, we also collect data for their matched baseline without the difficult structure. Comparing performance on the target vs. baseline sentences, the performance gap observed in humans holds for LLMs, with two exceptions: for models that are too weak performance is uniformly low across both sentence types, and for models that are too strong the performance is uniformly high. Together, these reveal convergence and divergence in human and LLM sentence comprehension, offering new insights into the similarity of humans and LLMs.

Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) assigns documents to multiple levels of a pre-defined taxonomy. Automated patent subject classification represents one of the hardest HTC scenarios because of domain knowledge difficulty and a huge number of labels. Prior approaches only output a flat label set, which offers little insight into the reason behind predictions. Therefore, we propose Reasoning for Hierarchical Classification (RHC), a novel framework that reformulates HTC as a step-by-step reasoning task to sequentially deduce hierarchical labels. RHC trains large language models (LLMs) in two stages: a cold-start stage that aligns outputs with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning format and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to enhance multi-step reasoning ability. RHC demonstrates four advantages in our experiments. (1) Effectiveness: RHC surpasses previous baselines and outperforms the supervised fine-tuning counterparts by approximately 3% in accuracy and macro F1. (2) Explainability: RHC produces natural-language justifications before prediction to facilitate human inspection. (3) Scalability: RHC scales favorably with model size with larger gains compared to standard fine-tuning. (4) Applicability: Beyond patents, we further demonstrate that RHC achieves state-of-the-art performance on other widely used HTC benchmarks, which highlights its broad applicability.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a critical role in many downstream tasks, yet depend strongly on the quality of training data. Despite various proposed data construction methods, their practical utility in real-world pipelines remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source datasets and data synthesis techniques for mathematical reasoning, evaluating them under a unified pipeline designed to mirror training and deployment scenarios. We further distill effective data selection strategies and identify practical methods suitable for industrial applications. Our findings highlight that structuring data in more interpretable formats, or distilling from stronger models often outweighs simply scaling up data volume. This study provides actionable guidance for integrating training data to enhance LLM capabilities, supporting both cost-effective data curation and scalable model enhancement. We hope this work will inspire further research on how to balance "more data" versus "better data" for real-world reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed medical systems. However, their potential within specialized domains such as nursing remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce NurseLLM, the first nursing-specialized LLM tailored for multiple choice question-answering (MCQ) tasks. We develop a multi-stage data generation pipeline to build the first large scale nursing MCQ dataset to train LLMs on a broad spectrum of nursing topics. We further introduce multiple nursing benchmarks to enable rigorous evaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NurseLLM outperforms SoTA general-purpose and medical-specialized LLMs of comparable size on different benchmarks, underscoring the importance of a specialized LLM for the nursing domain. Finally, we explore the role of reasoning and multi-agent collaboration systems in nursing, highlighting their promise for future research and applications.

<title>Quantifying Data Contamination in Psychometric Evaluations of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Recent studies apply psychometric questionnaires to Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess high-level psychological constructs such as values, personality, moral foundations, and dark traits. Although prior work has raised concerns about possible data contamination from psychometric inventories, which may threaten the reliability of such evaluations, there has been no systematic attempt to quantify the extent of this contamination. To address this gap, we propose a framework to systematically measure data contamination in psychometric evaluations of LLMs, evaluating three aspects: (1) item memorization, (2) evaluation memorization, and (3) target score matching. Applying this framework to 21 models from major families and four widely used psychometric inventories, we provide evidence that popular inventories such as the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44) and Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-40) exhibit strong contamination, where models not only memorize items but can also adjust their responses to achieve specific target scores.

<title>CARPAS: Towards Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization has attracted significant attention for its ability to generate more fine-grained and user-aligned summaries. While most existing approaches assume a set of predefined aspects as input, real-world scenarios often present challenges where these given aspects may be incomplete, irrelevant, or entirely missing from the document. Users frequently expect systems to adaptively refine or filter the provided aspects based on the actual content. In this paper, we initiate this novel task setting, termed Content-Aware Refinement of Provided Aspects for Summarization (CARPAS), with the aim of dynamically adjusting the provided aspects based on the document context before summarizing. We construct three new datasets to facilitate our pilot experiments, and by using LLMs with four representative prompting strategies in this task, we find that LLMs tend to predict an overly comprehensive set of aspects, which often results in excessively long and misaligned summaries. Building on this observation, we propose a preliminary subtask to predict the number of relevant aspects, and demonstrate that the predicted number can serve as effective guidance for the LLMs, reducing the inference difficulty, and enabling them to focus on the most pertinent aspects. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance across all datasets. Moreover, our deeper analyses uncover LLMs' compliance when the requested number of aspects differs from their own estimations, establishing a crucial insight for the deployment of LLMs in similar real-world applications.

<title>Biasless Language Models Learn Unnaturally: How LLMs Fail to Distinguish the Possible from the Impossible</title>

Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) sensitive to the distinction between humanly possible languages and humanly impossible languages? This question is taken by many to bear on whether LLMs and humans share the same innate learning biases. Previous work has attempted to answer it in the positive by comparing LLM learning curves on existing language datasets and on "impossible" datasets derived from them via various perturbation functions. Using the same methodology, we examine this claim on a wider set of languages and impossible perturbations. We find that in most cases, GPT-2 learns each language and its impossible counterpart equally easily, in contrast to previous claims. We also apply a more lenient condition by testing whether GPT-2 provides any kind of separation between the whole set of natural languages and the whole set of impossible languages. By considering cross-linguistic variance in various metrics computed on the perplexity curves, we show that GPT-2 provides no systematic separation between the possible and the impossible. Taken together, these perspectives show that LLMs do not share the human innate biases that shape linguistic typology.

<title>Sunflower: A New Approach To Expanding Coverage of African Languages in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: There are more than 2000 living languages in Africa, most of which have been bypassed by advances in language technology. Current leading LLMs exhibit strong performance on a number of the most common languages (e.g. Swahili or Yoruba), but prioritise support for the languages with the most speakers first, resulting in piecemeal ability across disparate languages. We contend that a regionally focussed approach is more efficient, and present a case study for Uganda, a country with high linguistic diversity. We describe the development of Sunflower 14B and 32B, a pair of models based on Qwen 3 with state of the art comprehension in the majority of all Ugandan languages. These models are open source and can be used to reduce language barriers in a number of important practical applications.

<title>Language Lives in Sparse Dimensions: Toward Interpretable and Efficient Multilingual Control for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit strong multilingual capabilities despite limited exposure to non-English data. Prior studies show that English-centric large language models map multilingual content into English-aligned representations at intermediate layers and then project them back into target-language token spaces in the final layer. From this observation, we hypothesize that this cross-lingual transition is governed by a small and sparse set of dimensions, which occur at consistent indices across the intermediate to final layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free method to identify and manipulate these dimensions, requiring only as few as 50 sentences of either parallel or monolingual data. Experiments on a multilingual generation control task reveal the interpretability of these dimensions, demonstrating that the interventions in these dimensions can switch the output language while preserving semantic content, and that it surpasses the performance of prior neuron-based approaches at a substantially lower cost.

arXiv:2510.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for low-resource African languages remains challenging due to limited transcribed speech data. While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI's Whisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, critical questions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paper addresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimum data volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primary failure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper's performance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages: systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to 1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours of training data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASR performance (WER < 13\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours of training data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER < 10\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysis reveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truth transcriptions, account for 38.6\% of high-error cases, indicating that careful data curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance. These results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teams developing ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts.

Abstract: Small Language models (SLMs) offer an efficient and accessible alternative to Large Language Models (LLMs), delivering strong performance while using far fewer resources. We introduce a simple and effective framework for pretraining SLMs that brings together three complementary ideas. First, we identify structurally sparse sub-network initializations that consistently outperform randomly initialized models of similar size under the same compute budget. Second, we use evolutionary search to automatically discover high-quality sub-network initializations, providing better starting points for pretraining. Third, we apply knowledge distillation from larger teacher models to speed up training and improve generalization. Together, these components make SLM pretraining substantially more efficient: our best model, discovered using evolutionary search and initialized with LLM weights, matches the validation perplexity of a comparable Pythia SLM while requiring 9.2x fewer pretraining tokens. We release all code and models at https://github.com/whittle-org/whittle/, offering a practical and reproducible path toward cost-efficient small language model development at scale.

Abstract: Simulating step-wise human behavior with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become an emerging research direction, enabling applications in various practical domains. While prior methods, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in modeling step-wise behavior, they primarily learn a population-level policy without conditioning on a user's persona, yielding generic rather than personalized simulations. In this work, we pose a critical question: how can LLM agents better simulate personalized user behavior? We introduce Customer-R1, an RL-based method for personalized, step-wise user behavior simulation in online shopping environments. Our policy is conditioned on an explicit persona, and we optimize next-step rationale and action generation via action correctness reward signals. Experiments on the OPeRA dataset emonstrate that Customer-R1 not only significantly outperforms prompting and SFT-based baselines in next-action prediction tasks, but also better matches users' action distribution, indicating higher fidelity in personalized behavior simulation.

Abstract: Causal reasoning is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand genuine cause-and-effect relationships beyond pattern matching. Existing benchmarks suffer from critical limitations such as reliance on synthetic data and narrow domain coverage. We introduce a novel benchmark constructed from casually identified relationships extracted from top-tier economics and finance journals, drawing on rigorous methodologies including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs. Our benchmark comprises 40,379 evaluation items covering five task types across domains such as health, environment, technology, law, and culture. Experimental results on eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal substantial limitations, with the best model achieving only 57.6\% accuracy. Moreover, model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even advanced reasoning models struggle with fundamental causal relationship identification. These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and demands of reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes applications.

<title>LAD-RAG: Layout-aware Dynamic RAG for Visually-Rich Document Understanding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering over visually rich documents (VRDs) requires reasoning not only over isolated content but also over documents' structural organization and cross-page dependencies. However, conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encode content in isolated chunks during ingestion, losing structural and cross-page dependencies, and retrieve a fixed number of pages at inference, regardless of the specific demands of the question or context. This often results in incomplete evidence retrieval and degraded answer quality for multi-page reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose LAD-RAG, a novel Layout-Aware Dynamic RAG framework. During ingestion, LAD-RAG constructs a symbolic document graph that captures layout structure and cross-page dependencies, adding it alongside standard neural embeddings to yield a more holistic representation of the document. During inference, an LLM agent dynamically interacts with the neural and symbolic indices to adaptively retrieve the necessary evidence based on the query. Experiments on MMLongBench-Doc, LongDocURL, DUDE, and MP-DocVQA demonstrate that LAD-RAG improves retrieval, achieving over 90% perfect recall on average without any top-k tuning, and outperforming baseline retrievers by up to 20% in recall at comparable noise levels, yielding higher QA accuracy with minimal latency.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) and the real world has outpaced the static nature of widely used evaluation benchmarks, raising concerns about their reliability for evaluating LLM factuality. While substantial works continue to rely on the popular but old benchmarks, their temporal misalignment with real-world facts and modern LLMs, and their effects on LLM factuality evaluation remain underexplored. Therefore, in this work, we present a systematic investigation of this issue by examining five popular factuality benchmarks and eight LLMs released across different years. An up-to-date fact retrieval pipeline and three metrics are tailored to quantify benchmark aging and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. Experimental results and analysis illustrate that a considerable portion of samples in the widely used factuality benchmarks are outdated, leading to unreliable assessments of LLM factuality. We hope our work can provide a testbed to assess the reliability of a benchmark for LLM factuality evaluation and inspire more research on the benchmark aging issue. Codes are available in https://github.com/JiangXunyi/BenchAge.

Abstract: Automated red-teaming has emerged as a scalable approach for auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) prior to deployment, yet existing approaches lack mechanisms to efficiently adapt to model-specific vulnerabilities at inference. We introduce Red-Bandit, a red-teaming framework that adapts online to identify and exploit model failure modes under distinct attack styles (e.g., manipulation, slang). Red-Bandit post-trains a set of parameter-efficient LoRA experts, each specialized for a particular attack style, using reinforcement learning that rewards the generation of unsafe prompts via a rule-based safety model. At inference, a multi-armed bandit policy dynamically selects among these attack-style experts based on the target model's response safety, balancing exploration and exploitation. Red-Bandit achieves state-of-the-art results on AdvBench under sufficient exploration (ASR@10), while producing more human-readable prompts (lower perplexity). Moreover, Red-Bandit's bandit policy serves as a diagnostic tool for uncovering model-specific vulnerabilities by indicating which attack styles most effectively elicit unsafe behaviors.

arXiv:2510.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training for reasoning of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on verifiable rewards: deterministic checkers that provide 0-1 correctness signals. While reliable, such binary feedback is brittle--many tasks admit partially correct or alternative answers that verifiers under-credit, and the resulting all-or-nothing supervision limits learning. Reward models offer richer, continuous feedback, which can serve as a complementary supervisory signal to verifiers. We introduce HERO (Hybrid Ensemble Reward Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that integrates verifier signals with reward-model scores in a structured way. HERO employs stratified normalization to bound reward-model scores within verifier-defined groups, preserving correctness while refining quality distinctions, and variance-aware weighting to emphasize challenging prompts where dense signals matter most. Across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, HERO consistently outperforms RM-only and verifier-only baselines, with strong gains on both verifiable and hard-to-verify tasks. Our results show that hybrid reward design retains the stability of verifiers while leveraging the nuance of reward models to advance reasoning.

Abstract: Evaluating large language model (LLM) outputs in the legal domain presents unique challenges due to the complex and nuanced nature of legal analysis. Current evaluation approaches either depend on reference data, which is costly to produce, or use standardized assessment methods, both of which have significant limitations for legal applications.
  Although LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising evaluation technique, its reliability and effectiveness in legal contexts depend heavily on evaluation processes unique to the legal industry and how trustworthy the evaluation appears to the human legal expert. This is where existing evaluation methods currently fail and exhibit considerable variability.
  This paper aims to close the gap: a) we break down lengthy responses into 'Legal Data Points' (LDPs), self-contained units of information, and introduce a novel, reference-free evaluation methodology that reflects how lawyers evaluate legal answers; b) we demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety of baselines on both our proprietary dataset and an open-source dataset (LegalBench); c) we show how our method correlates more closely with human expert evaluations and helps improve inter-annotator agreement; and finally d) we open source our Legal Data Points for a subset of LegalBench used in our experiments, allowing the research community to replicate our results and advance research in this vital area of LLM evaluation on legal question-answering.

<title>Don't Adapt Small Language Models for Tools; Adapt Tool Schemas to the Models</title>

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer significant computational advantages for tool-augmented AI systems, yet they struggle with tool-use tasks, particularly in selecting appropriate tools and identifying correct parameters. A common failure mode is schema misalignment: models hallucinate plausible but non-existent tool names that reflect naming conventions internalized during pretraining but absent from the provided tool schema. Rather than forcing models to adapt to arbitrary schemas, we propose adapting schemas to align with models' pretrained knowledge. We introduce PA-Tool (Pretraining-Aligned Tool Schema Generation), a training-free method that leverages peakedness-a signal from contamination detection indicating pretraining familiarity-to automatically rename tool components. By generating multiple candidates and selecting those with highest output concentration across samples, PA-Tool identifies pretrain-aligned naming patterns. Experiments on MetaTool and RoTBench show improvements of up to 17% points, with schema misalignment errors reduced by 80%. PA-Tool enables small models to approach state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency for adaptation to new tools without retraining. Our work demonstrates that schema-level interventions can unlock the tool-use potential of resource-efficient models by adapting schemas to models rather than models to schemas.

Abstract: Rubrics provide a flexible way to train LLMs on open-ended long-form answers where verifiable rewards are not applicable and human preferences provide coarse signals. Prior work shows that reinforcement learning with rubric-based rewards leads to consistent gains in LLM post-training. Most existing approaches rely on rubrics that remain static over the course of training. Such static rubrics, however, are vulnerable to reward-hacking type behaviors and fail to capture emergent desiderata that arise during training. We introduce Online Rubrics Elicitation (OnlineRubrics), a method that dynamically curates evaluation criteria in an online manner through pairwise comparisons of responses from current and reference policies. This online process enables continuous identification and mitigation of errors as training proceeds. Empirically, this approach yields consistent improvements of up to 8% over training exclusively with static rubrics across AlpacaEval, GPQA, ArenaHard as well as the validation sets of expert questions and rubrics. We qualitatively analyze the elicited criteria and identify prominent themes such as transparency, practicality, organization, and reasoning.

<title>On the Convergence of Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions provide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction. The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. Focusing on moral self-correction in LLMs, we reveal a key characteristic of intrinsic self-correction: performance convergence through multi-round interactions; and provide a mechanistic analysis of this convergence behavior. Based on our experimental results and analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanism of convergence: consistently injected self-correction instructions activate moral concepts that reduce model uncertainty, leading to converged performance as the activated moral concepts stabilize over successive rounds. This paper demonstrates the strong potential of moral self-correction by showing that it exhibits a desirable property of converged performance.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by adopting the "think-then-answer" paradigm, which enhances both accuracy and interpretability. However, current LRMs exhibit two critical limitations when processing non-English languages: (1) They often struggle to maintain input-output language consistency; (2) They generally perform poorly with wrong reasoning paths and lower answer accuracy compared to English. These limitations significantly degrade the user experience for non-English speakers and hinder the global deployment of LRMs. To address these limitations, we propose M-Thinker, which is trained by the GRPO algorithm that involves a Language Consistency (LC) reward and a novel Cross-lingual Thinking Alignment (CTA) reward. Specifically, the LC reward defines a strict constraint on the language consistency between the input, thought, and answer. Besides, the CTA reward compares the model's non-English reasoning paths with its English reasoning path to transfer its own reasoning capability from English to non-English languages. Through an iterative RL procedure, our M-Thinker-1.5B/7B models not only achieve nearly 100% language consistency and superior performance on two multilingual benchmarks (MMATH and PolyMath), but also exhibit excellent generalization on out-of-domain languages.

Abstract: In the business domain, where data-driven decision making is crucial, text-to-SQL is fundamental for easy natural language access to structured data. While recent LLMs have achieved strong performance in code generation, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain focused on factual retrieval of past records. We introduce CORGI, a new benchmark specifically designed for real-world business contexts. CORGI is composed of synthetic databases inspired by enterprises such as Doordash, Airbnb, and Lululemon. It provides questions across four increasingly complex categories of business queries: descriptive, explanatory, predictive, and recommendational. This challenge calls for causal reasoning, temporal forecasting, and strategic recommendation, reflecting multi-level and multi-step agentic intelligence. We find that LLM performance drops on high-level questions, struggling to make accurate predictions and offer actionable plans. Based on execution success rate, the CORGI benchmark is about 21\% more difficult than the BIRD benchmark. This highlights the gap between popular LLMs and the need for real-world business intelligence. We release a public dataset and evaluation framework, and a website for public submissions.

<title>Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed vibe coding, where users leverage LLMs to generate and iteratively refine code through natural language interactions until it passes their vibe check. Vibe check is tied to real-world human preference and goes beyond functionality: the solution should feel right, read cleanly, preserve intent, and remain correct. However, current code evaluation remains anchored to pass@k and captures only functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional instructions that users routinely apply. In this paper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece underlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides functional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following capabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30 verifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic verifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites, resulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following and functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even the strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit clear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional correctness and instruction following correlates the best with human preference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on real-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe check, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that better align with user preferences in coding.

Abstract: Long-sequence modeling faces a fundamental trade-off between the efficiency of compressive fixed-size memory in RNN-like models and the fidelity of lossless growing memory in attention-based Transformers. Inspired by the Multi-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of artificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the Transformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module termed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses out-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To validate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like architectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate that AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and achieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance, augmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5% and memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k sequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88. Code is available at: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/AHN.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed, high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions. CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate, verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical and symbolic libraries) and (ii) a retrieval tool (task-relevant external information) to execute exact calculations and ground decisions. The system further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models, AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32 for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool baselines, thereby lifting the capability ceiling of FMs. More empirical results and implementation details will be updated at https://github.com/tmlr-group/AlphaApollo.

<title>Asking For It: Question-Answering for Predicting Rule Infractions in Online Content Moderation</title>

Abstract: Online communities rely on a mix of platform policies and community-authored rules to define acceptable behavior and maintain order. However, these rules vary widely across communities, evolve over time, and are enforced inconsistently, posing challenges for transparency, governance, and automation. In this paper, we model the relationship between rules and their enforcement at scale, introducing ModQ, a novel question-answering framework for rule-sensitive content moderation. Unlike prior classification or generation-based approaches, ModQ conditions on the full set of community rules at inference time and identifies which rule best applies to a given comment. We implement two model variants - extractive and multiple-choice QA - and train them on large-scale datasets from Reddit and Lemmy, the latter of which we construct from publicly available moderation logs and rule descriptions. Both models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in identifying moderation-relevant rule violations, while remaining lightweight and interpretable. Notably, ModQ models generalize effectively to unseen communities and rules, supporting low-resource moderation settings and dynamic governance environments.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings: instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and generalization for foundation models.

<title>The Markovian Thinker</title>

arXiv:2510.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

<title>Reading Between the Lines: Towards Reliable Black-box LLM Fingerprinting via Zeroth-order Gradient Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substantial investment required to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) makes them valuable intellectual property, raising significant concerns about copyright protection. LLM fingerprinting has emerged as a key technique to address this, which aims to verify a model's origin by extracting an intrinsic, unique signature (a "fingerprint") and comparing it to that of a source model to identify illicit copies. However, existing black-box fingerprinting methods often fail to generate distinctive LLM fingerprints. This ineffectiveness arises because black-box methods typically rely on model outputs, which lose critical information about the model's unique parameters due to the usage of non-linear functions. To address this, we first leverage Fisher Information Theory to formally demonstrate that the gradient of the model's input is a more informative feature for fingerprinting than the output. Based on this insight, we propose ZeroPrint, a novel method that approximates these information-rich gradients in a black-box setting using zeroth-order estimation. ZeroPrint overcomes the challenge of applying this to discrete text by simulating input perturbations via semantic-preserving word substitutions. This operation allows ZeroPrint to estimate the model's Jacobian matrix as a unique fingerprint. Experiments on the standard benchmark show ZeroPrint achieves a state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, significantly outperforming existing black-box methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech synthesis technologies have led to increasingly sophisticated spoofing attacks, posing significant challenges for automatic speaker verification systems. While systems based on self-supervised learning (SSL) models, particularly the XLSR-Conformer architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance in synthetic speech detection, there remains room for architectural improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that replaces the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in the XLSR-Conformer model with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a powerful universal approximator based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Our experimental results on ASVspoof2021 demonstrate that the integration of KAN to XLSR-Conformer model can improve the performance by 60.55% relatively in Equal Error Rate (EER) LA and DF sets, further achieving 0.70% EER on the 21LA set. Besides, the proposed replacement is also robust to various SSL architectures. These findings suggest that incorporating KAN into SSL-based models is a promising direction for advances in synthetic speech detection.

<title>Differentially Private Synthetic Text Generation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by grounding them in external knowledge. However, its application in sensitive domains is limited by privacy risks. Existing private RAG methods typically rely on query-time differential privacy (DP), which requires repeated noise injection and leads to accumulated privacy loss. To address this issue, we propose DP-SynRAG, a framework that uses LLMs to generate differentially private synthetic RAG databases. Unlike prior methods, the synthetic text can be reused once created, thereby avoiding repeated noise injection and additional privacy costs. To preserve essential information for downstream RAG tasks, DP-SynRAG extends private prediction, which instructs LLMs to generate text that mimics subsampled database records in a DP manner. Experiments show that DP-SynRAG achieves superior performanec to the state-of-the-art private RAG systems while maintaining a fixed privacy budget, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving RAG.

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound, and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans. It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop, composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation, significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution ensuring soundness.

<title>Exposing Citation Vulnerabilities in Generative Engines</title>

Abstract: We analyze answers generated by generative engines (GEs) from the perspectives of citation publishers and the content-injection barrier, defined as the difficulty for attackers to manipulate answers to user prompts by placing malicious content on the web. GEs integrate two functions: web search and answer generation that cites web pages using large language models. Because anyone can publish information on the web, GEs are vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Existing studies of citation evaluation focus on how faithfully answer content reflects cited sources, leaving unexamined which web sources should be selected as citations to defend against poisoning attacks. To fill this gap, we introduce evaluation criteria that assess poisoning threats using the citation information contained in answers. Our criteria classify the publisher attributes of citations to estimate the content-injection barrier thereby revealing the threat of poisoning attacks in current GEs. We conduct experiments in political domains in Japan and the United States (U.S.) using our criteria and show that citations from official party websites (primary sources) are approximately \(25\%\)--\(45\%\) in the U.S. and \(60\%\)--\(65\%\) in Japan, indicating that U.S. political answers are at higher risk of poisoning attacks. We also find that sources with low content-injection barriers are frequently cited yet are poorly reflected in answer content. To mitigate this threat, we discuss how publishers of primary sources can increase exposure of their web content in answers and show that well-known techniques are limited by language differences.

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is a critical component in downstream NLP tasks such as document tagging, ontology construction and patent analysis. Current state-of-the-art methods require expensive human annotation and struggle with domain transfer, limiting their practical deployment. This highlights the need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic evaluation settings. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the document- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model that outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot learning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this benchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this black-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability. Building on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE. To further enhance document-level consistency, oftentimes needed for downstream tasks, we introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics. Our approach exceeds previous approaches on 5/7 domains with an average improvement of 10 percentage points. We release our dataset and fine-tuned models to support future research in this area.

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces, asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end, we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores. Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by 10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes, while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

Abstract: There are very few SotA deception systems based on Large Language Models. The existing ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH shells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs - lack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has recently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers have demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking honeytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as honeypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes, which can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell, MySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus VelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users' needs. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and realism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities and the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using unit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful prompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having a 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception capabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the attackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were assigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH Linux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks. Analysis of these attacks showed us that LLM honeypots simulating Linux shells can perform well against unstructured and unexpected attacks on the Internet, responding correctly to most of the issued commands.

Abstract: This paper presents the vision, scientific contributions, and technical details of RedTWIZ: an adaptive and diverse multi-turn red teaming framework, to audit the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI-assisted software development. Our work is driven by three major research streams: (1) robust and systematic assessment of LLM conversational jailbreaks; (2) a diverse generative multi-turn attack suite, supporting compositional, realistic and goal-oriented jailbreak conversational strategies; and (3) a hierarchical attack planner, which adaptively plans, serializes, and triggers attacks tailored to specific LLM's vulnerabilities. Together, these contributions form a unified framework -- combining assessment, attack generation, and strategic planning -- to comprehensively evaluate and expose weaknesses in LLMs' robustness. Extensive evaluation is conducted to systematically assess and analyze the performance of the overall system and each component. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-turn adversarial attack strategies can successfully lead state-of-the-art LLMs to produce unsafe generations, highlighting the pressing need for more research into enhancing LLM's robustness.

<title>The Cognitive Bandwidth Bottleneck: Shifting Long-Horizon Agent from Planning with Actions to Planning with Schemas</title>

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas (PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ] to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable autonomy.

<title>A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search</title>

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured, multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover, task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state, (ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process, where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama, Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping online communication by enabling large-scale production of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) at low cost. While its presence is rapidly growing across the Web, little is known about how MGT integrates into social media environments. In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-art statistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity (2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main community types such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study the concentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT to human-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement it receives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates that synthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to 9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed across communities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge and social support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction of users. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status giving typical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGT achieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a few cases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organic component of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective on the MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involving platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.

<title>AudioMarathon: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Long-Context Audio Understanding and Efficiency in Audio LLMs</title>

Abstract: Processing long-form audio is a major challenge for Large Audio Language models (LALMs). These models struggle with the quadratic cost of attention ($O(N^2)$) and with modeling long-range temporal dependencies. Existing audio benchmarks are built mostly from short clips and do not evaluate models in realistic long context settings. To address this gap, we introduce AudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and inference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set of tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations ranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of 2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech, sound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference. We evaluate state-of-the-art LALMs and observe clear performance drops as audio length grows. We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs of token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across current LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and memory-efficient architectures. We believe AudioMarathon will drive the audio and multimodal research community to develop more advanced audio understanding models capable of solving complex audio tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language generation and general task performance. However, their application to spoken language understanding (SLU) remains challenging, particularly for token-level tasks, where the autoregressive nature of LLMs often leads to misalignment issues. They also struggle to capture nuanced interrelations in semantic-level tasks through direct fine-tuning alone. To address these challenges, we propose the Entity-level Language Model (ECLM) framework, which reformulates slot-filling as an entity recognition task and introduces a novel concept, \textit{Chain of Intent}, to enable step-by-step multi-intent recognition. Experimental results show that ECLM significantly outperforms strong baselines such as Uni-MIS, achieving gains of 3.7\% on MixATIS and 3.1\% on MixSNIPS. Compared to standard supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, ECLM further achieves improvements of 8.5\% and 21.2\% on these datasets, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/SJY8460/ECLM.

Abstract: It is common to reject undesired outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs); however, current methods to do so require an excessive amount of computation to re-sample after a rejection, or distort the distribution of outputs by constraining the output to highly improbable tokens. We present a method, Approximately Aligned Decoding (AprAD), to balance the distortion of the output distribution with computational efficiency, inspired by algorithms from the speculative decoding literature. AprAD allows for the generation of long sequences of text with difficult-to-satisfy constraints, while amplifying low probability outputs much less compared to existing methods. We show through a series of experiments that the task-specific performance of AprAD is comparable to methods that do not distort the output distribution, while being much more computationally efficient.

<title>SuffixDecoding: Extreme Speculative Decoding for Emerging AI Applications</title>

arXiv:2411.04975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling. SuffixDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference

Abstract: It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible. This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 6 LMs of different sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are prunable, probably appearing in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens fall into two categories: filler tokens, which can be replaced with semantically unrelated substitutes, and keywords, that tend to have at least a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic relations with it. Additionally, human experts can reliably identify the most influential tokens in an autoprompt a posteriori, suggesting these prompts are not entirely opaque. Finally, some of the ablations we applied to autoprompts yield similar effects in natural language inputs, suggesting that autoprompts emerge naturally from the way LMs process linguistic inputs in general.

Abstract: We present OLMo 2, the next generation of our fully open language models. OLMo 2 includes a family of dense autoregressive language models at 7B, 13B and 32B scales with fully released artifacts -- model weights, full training data, training code and recipes, training logs and thousands of intermediate checkpoints. In this work, we describe our modified model architecture and training recipe, focusing on techniques for achieving better training stability and improved per-token efficiency. Our updated pretraining data mixture introduces a new, specialized data mix called Dolmino Mix 1124, which significantly improves model capabilities across many downstream task benchmarks when introduced via late-stage curriculum training (i.e. specialized data during the annealing phase of pretraining). Finally, we incorporate best practices from T\"ulu 3 to develop OLMo 2-Instruct, focusing on permissive data and extending our final-stage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our OLMo 2 base models sit at the Pareto frontier of performance to training compute, often matching or outperforming open-weight only models like Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 2 while using fewer FLOPs and with fully transparent training data, code, and recipe. Our fully open OLMo 2-Instruct models are competitive with open-weight only models of comparable size and even some proprietary models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT 4o Mini.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses are essential for synthesizing research insights, but they remain time-intensive and labor-intensive due to the iterative processes of screening, evaluation, and data extraction. This paper introduces and evaluates LatteReview, a Python-based framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems to automate key elements of the systematic review process. Designed to streamline workflows while maintaining rigor, LatteReview utilizes modular agents for tasks such as title and abstract screening, relevance scoring, and structured data extraction. These agents operate within orchestrated workflows, supporting sequential and parallel review rounds, dynamic decision-making, and iterative refinement based on user feedback. LatteReview's architecture integrates LLM providers, enabling compatibility with both cloud-based and locally hosted models. The framework supports features such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for incorporating external context, multimodal reviews, Pydantic-based validation for structured inputs and outputs, and asynchronous programming for handling large-scale datasets. The framework is available on the GitHub repository, with detailed documentation and an installable package.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs. In this paper, we systematically study gaslighting negation attacks: a phenomenon where models, despite initially providing correct answers, are persuaded by user-provided negations to reverse their outputs, often fabricating justifications. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks and observe substantial performance drops when negation is introduced. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA, though even advanced reasoning-oriented models like Gemini-2.5-Pro remain susceptible. Our category-level analysis further shows that subjective or socially nuanced domains (e.g., Social Relation, Image Emotion) are especially fragile, while more objective domains (e.g., Geography) exhibit relatively smaller but still notable drops. Overall, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under gaslighting negation attack. These findings highlight a fundamental robustness gap and provide insights for developing more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: While multilingual large language models generally perform adequately, and sometimes even rival English performance on high-resource languages (HRLs), they often significantly underperform on low-resource languages (LRLs). Among several prompting strategies aiming at bridging the gap, multilingual in-context learning (ICL) has been particularly effective when demonstration in target languages is unavailable. However, there lacks a systematic understanding of when and why it works well.
  In this work, we systematically analyze multilingual ICL, using demonstrations in HRLs to enhance cross-lingual transfer. We show that demonstrations in mixed HRLs consistently outperform English-only ones across the board, particularly for tasks written in LRLs. Surprisingly, our ablation study shows that the presence of irrelevant non-English sentences in the prompt yields measurable gains, suggesting the effectiveness of multilingual exposure itself. Our results highlight the potential of strategically leveraging multilingual resources to bridge the performance gap for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) return just responses which adhere to societal values is crucial for their broader application. Prior research has shown that LLMs often fail to perform satisfactorily on tasks requiring moral cognizance, such as ethics-based judgments. While current approaches have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with curated datasets to improve their capabilities on such tasks, choosing the optimal learning paradigm to enhance the ethical responses of LLMs remains an open research debate. In this work, we aim to address this fundamental question: can current learning paradigms enable LLMs to acquire sufficient moral reasoning capabilities? Drawing from distributional semantics theory and the pragmatic nature of moral discourse, our analysis indicates that performance improvements follow a mechanism similar to that of semantic-level tasks, and therefore remain affected by the pragmatic nature of morals latent in discourse, a phenomenon we name the pragmatic dilemma. We conclude that this pragmatic dilemma imposes significant limitations on the generalization ability of current learning paradigms, making it the primary bottleneck for moral reasoning acquisition in LLMs.

Abstract: Sequential dependencies present a fundamental bottleneck in deploying large-scale autoregressive models, particularly for real-time applications. While traditional optimization approaches like pruning and quantization often compromise model quality, recent advances in generation-refinement frameworks demonstrate that this trade-off can be significantly mitigated.
  This survey presents a comprehensive taxonomy of generation-refinement frameworks, analyzing methods across autoregressive sequence tasks. We categorize methods based on their generation strategies (from simple n-gram prediction to sophisticated draft models) and refinement mechanisms (including single-pass verification and iterative approaches). Through systematic analysis of both algorithmic innovations and system-level implementations, we examine deployment strategies across computing environments and explore applications spanning text, images, and speech generation. This systematic examination of both theoretical frameworks and practical implementations provides a foundation for future research in efficient autoregressive decoding.

Abstract: Social biases and belief-driven behaviors can significantly impact Large Language Models (LLMs) decisions on several tasks. As LLMs are increasingly used in multi-agent systems for societal simulations, their ability to model fundamental group psychological characteristics remains critical yet under-explored. In this study, we present a multi-agent framework that simulates belief congruence, a classical group psychology theory that plays a crucial role in shaping societal interactions and preferences. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit amplified belief congruence compared to humans, across diverse contexts. We further investigate the implications of this behavior on two downstream tasks: (1) misinformation dissemination and (2) LLM learning, finding that belief congruence in LLMs increases misinformation dissemination and impedes learning. To mitigate these negative impacts, we propose strategies inspired by: (1) contact hypothesis, (2) accuracy nudges, and (3) global citizenship framework. Our results show that the best strategies reduce misinformation dissemination by up to 37% and enhance learning by 11%. Bridging social psychology and AI, our work provides insights to navigate real-world interactions using LLMs while addressing belief-driven biases.

Abstract: The paper shows that parameter-efficient reinforcement learning (PE-RL) is a highly effective training regime to improve large language models' (LLMs) ability to answer queries on sensitive topics with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), i.e. to provide significantly more informative, diverse and impartial answers. This is shown by evaluating PE-RL and multiple strong baselines-including LoRA finetuning (strongest baseline), SFT and RLHF. PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating sufficient answers from "great'' answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative analysis corroborates this. Moreover, our evaluation also finds a key property of PE-RL for this task: unlike methods that update all parameters, it generalises out of topic. Finally, to enable further studies we also release the dataset, SHQ-NPOV, and provide a methodology to create such datasets through iterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training.

Abstract: We introduce MCTS-RAG, a novel approach that enhances the reasoning capabilities of small language models on knowledge-intensive tasks by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide relevant context and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine reasoning paths. MCTS-RAG dynamically integrates retrieval and reasoning through an iterative decision-making process. Unlike standard RAG methods, which typically retrieve information independently from reasoning and thus integrate knowledge suboptimally, or conventional MCTS reasoning, which depends solely on internal model knowledge without external facts, MCTS-RAG combines structured reasoning with adaptive retrieval. This integrated approach enhances decision-making, reduces hallucinations, and ensures improved factual accuracy and response consistency. The experimental results on multiple reasoning and knowledge-intensive datasets datasets (i.e., ComplexWebQA, GPQA, and FoolMeTwice) show that our method enables small-scale LMs to achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by effectively scaling inference-time compute, setting a new standard for reasoning in small-scale models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant disparities in performance across languages, primarily benefiting high-resource languages while marginalizing underrepresented ones. Continual Pretraining (CPT) has emerged as a promising approach to address this imbalance, although the relative effectiveness of monolingual, bilingual, and code-augmented data strategies remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates 36 CPT configurations involving three multilingual base models, across 30+ languages categorized as altruistic, selfish, and stagnant, spanning various resource levels. Our findings reveal three major insights: (1) Bilingual CPT improves multilingual classification but often causes language mixing issues during generation. (2) Including programming code data during CPT consistently enhances multilingual classification accuracy, particularly benefiting low-resource languages, but introduces a trade-off by slightly degrading generation quality. (3) Contrary to prior work, we observe substantial deviations from language classifications according to their impact on cross-lingual transfer: Languages classified as altruistic often negatively affect related languages, selfish languages show conditional and configuration-dependent behavior, and stagnant languages demonstrate surprising adaptability under certain CPT conditions. These nuanced interactions emphasize the complexity of multilingual representation learning, underscoring the importance of systematic studies on generalizable language classification to inform future multilingual CPT strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are advancing at an unprecedented pace globally, with regions increasingly adopting these models for applications in their primary language. Evaluation of these models in diverse linguistic environments, especially in low-resource languages, has become a major challenge for academia and industry. Existing evaluation frameworks are disproportionately focused on English and a handful of high-resource languages, thereby overlooking the realistic performance of LLMs in multilingual and lower-resource scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce GlotEval, a lightweight framework designed for massively multilingual evaluation. Supporting seven key tasks (machine translation, text classification, summarization, open-ended generation, reading comprehension, sequence labeling, and intrinsic evaluation), spanning over dozens to hundreds of languages, GlotEval highlights consistent multilingual benchmarking, language-specific prompt templates, and non-English-centric machine translation. This enables a precise diagnosis of model strengths and weaknesses in diverse linguistic contexts. A multilingual translation case study demonstrates GlotEval's applicability for multilingual and language-specific evaluations.

Abstract: We investigate how next-token prediction (NTP) optimization leads language models to extract and organize semantic structure from text. Our analysis, based on a tractable mathematical model and controlled synthetic data, reveals that NTP implicitly guides models to factor a centered support matrix encoding context-to-next-token co-occurrence patterns via singular value decomposition (SVD). While models never explicitly construct this matrix, learned word and context embeddings converge to its SVD factors, with singular vectors encoding latent semantic concepts through their sign patterns. We demonstrate that concepts corresponding to larger singular values are learned earlier during training, yielding a natural semantic hierarchy where broad categories emerge before fine-grained ones. This insight motivates orthant-based clustering, a method that combines concept signs to identify interpretable semantic categories. We validate our findings on synthetic datasets and pretrained language models, recovering diverse semantic structures such as grammatical categories, named entity types, and topical distinctions (medical, entertainment). Our work bridges classical distributional semantics and neural collapse geometry, characterizing how gradient-based optimization implicitly determines both the matrix representation and factorization method that encode semantic structure.

Abstract: Enhancing the quality and efficiency of academic publishing is critical for both authors and reviewers, as research papers are central to scholarly communication and a major source of high-quality content on the web. To support this goal, we propose AutoRev, an automatic peer-review system designed to provide actionable, high-quality feedback to both reviewers and authors. AutoRev leverages a novel Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that combines textual and graphical representations of academic papers. By modelling documents as graphs, AutoRev effectively retrieves the most pertinent information, significantly reducing the input context length for LLMs and thereby enhancing their review generation capabilities. Experimental results show that AutoRev outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 58.72% and demonstrates competitive performance in human evaluations against ground truth reviews. We envision AutoRev as a powerful tool to streamline the peer-review workflow, alleviating challenges and enabling scalable, high-quality scholarly publishing. By guiding both authors and reviewers, AutoRev has the potential to accelerate the dissemination of quality research on the web at a larger scale. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) is crucial for evaluating the model's capability to integrate information from diverse sources. However, creating extensive and high-quality MHQA datasets is challenging: (i) manual annotation is expensive, and (ii) current synthesis methods often produce simplistic questions or require extensive manual guidance. This paper introduces HopWeaver, the first cross-document framework synthesizing authentic multi-hop questions without human intervention. HopWeaver synthesizes bridge and comparison questions through an innovative pipeline that identifies complementary documents and constructs authentic reasoning paths to ensure true multi-hop reasoning. We further present a comprehensive system for evaluating the synthesized multi-hop questions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the synthesized questions achieve comparable or superior quality to human-annotated datasets at a lower cost. Our framework provides a valuable tool for the research community: it can automatically generate challenging benchmarks from any raw corpus, which opens new avenues for both evaluation and targeted training to improve the reasoning capabilities of advanced QA models, especially in domains with scarce resources.

<title>FlowKV: Enhancing Multi-Turn Conversational Coherence in LLMs via Isolated Key-Value Cache Management</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting. This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism} for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns. Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

<title>Do RAG Systems Really Suffer From Positional Bias?</title>

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/SimpleDeepSearcher.

<title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Model Merging for Cross-Lingual Transfer in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce. Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them from the start.

<title>Guiding Giants: Lightweight Controllers for Weighted Activation Steering in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Controlling undesirable Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors, such as the generation of unsafe content or failing to adhere to safety guidelines, often relies on costly fine-tuning. Activation steering provides an alternative for inference-time control, but existing methods typically lack fine-grained, adaptive mechanisms. We introduce a novel approach using a lightweight, trainable controller network integrated during inference. This controller network observes specific intermediate LLM activations and predicts both a global scaling factor and layer-specific weights. The predicted global scaling factor and layer-specific weights then dynamically modulate the intensity of a steering patch, derived from a pre-computed "refusal direction" vector, applied across the LLM's layers during generation. Trained on activations from both harmful and benign prompts, our controller learns to discriminatively apply nuanced, layer-aware interventions, activating steering primarily for harmful inputs. Experiments using safety benchmarks like ToxicChat & In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts demonstrate that our weighted steering controller significantly increases refusal rates compared to the base LLM, achieving targeted behavioral modification without altering the original model parameters. Our experiments with Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.2-1B & Mistral-7B show our approach outperforms existing methods, presenting an efficient and adaptive method for fine-grained control over LLM behavior at inference time.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for categorizing free-text explanations in English. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in domains such as visual understanding and mathematical reasoning. However, their application in the medical domain is constrained by two key challenges: (1) multimodal medical datasets are scarce and often contain sparse information, limiting reasoning depth; and (2) Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), though effective in general domains, cannot reliably improve model performance in the medical domain. To overcome these challenges, during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, we incorporate high-quality textual reasoning data and general multimodal data alongside multimodal medical data to efficiently enhance foundational medical capabilities and restore the base model's reasoning ability. Moreover, considering that there are some multimodal medical datasets with sparse information, we further synthesize reflective-pattern-injected chain-of-thought (CoT) in addition to general CoT samples, equipping the model with initial reflective reasoning capabilities that provide a structured foundation for subsequent RLVR training. Finally, we introduce our InfiMed-Series models, InfiMed-SFT-3B and InfiMed-RL-3B, both of which deliver state-of-the-art performance across seven multimodal medical benchmarks. Notably, InfiMed-RL-3B achieves an average accuracy of 59.2%, outperforming even larger models like InternVL3-8B, which achieves 57.3%. Specifically, during the SFT phase, we utilized 188K samples, while the RLVR phase incorporated 36K samples, demonstrating the efficacy of both training strategies in achieving superior performance. We also conducted a series of extensive experiments, which provide valuable insights that contribute to advancing the performance of MLLMs in medical scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to their capacity for reasoning about mental states, yet failures in this capacity often manifest as systematic implicit bias. Evaluating this bias is challenging, as conventional direct-query methods are susceptible to social desirability effects and fail to capture its subtle, multi-dimensional nature. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework that leverages the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to reconceptualize bias as a multi-dimensional failure in ToM across Competence, Sociability, and Morality. The framework introduces two indirect tasks: the Word Association Bias Test (WABT) to assess implicit lexical associations and the Affective Attribution Test (AAT) to measure covert affective leanings, both designed to probe latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance. Extensive experiments on 8 State-of-the-Art LLMs demonstrate our framework's capacity to reveal complex bias structures, including pervasive sociability bias, multi-dimensional divergence, and asymmetric stereotype amplification, thereby providing a more robust methodology for identifying the structural nature of implicit bias.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on complex mathematical benchmarks yet sometimes fail on basic math reasoning while generating unnecessarily verbose responses. In this paper, we present a systematic benchmark and comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the efficiency of reasoning in LLMs, focusing on the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and overthinking. First, we formalize the accuracy-verbosity tradeoff. Second, we introduce the Overthinking Score, a harmonic-mean metric combining accuracy and token-efficiency for holistic model evaluation. Third, we establish an evaluation protocol with dynamically-generated data across 14 basic math tasks. Fourth, we conduct a large-scale empirical study evaluating 53 LLMs, including reasoning and quantized variants across different reasoning budgets. Our findings reveal: 1) model performance on complex benchmarks does not translate directly to basic math reasoning; 2) reasoning models generate ~18 more tokens while sometimes achieving lower accuracy and exhibit catastrophic collapse when token is constrained, dropping by ~28; 3) the accuracy-verbosity relationship is non-monotonic with extended reasoning budgets yielding diminishing returns (GPT-5/o-series models show zero accuracy gain from low -> medium -> high reasoning effort). Our findings challenge the assumption that longer reasoning in LLMs necessarily improves mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains. Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards inductive image-free inference.

Abstract: Designing user-centered LLM systems requires understanding how people use them, but patterns of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. In this work, we introduce a new framework to describe request-making that segments user input into request content, roles assigned, query-specific context, and the remaining task-independent expressions. We apply the workflow to create and analyze a dataset of 211k real-world queries based on WildChat. Compared with similar human-human setups, we find significant differences in the language for request-making in the human-LLM scenario. Further, we introduce a novel and essential perspective of diachronic analyses with user expressions, which reveals fundamental and habitual user-LLM interaction patterns beyond individual task completion. We find that query patterns evolve from early ones emphasizing sole requests to combining more context later on, and individual users explore expression patterns but tend to converge with more experience. From there, we propose to understand communal trends of expressions underlying distinct tasks and discuss the preliminary findings. Finally, we discuss the key implications for user studies, computational pragmatics, and LLM alignment.

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce concise, high-performing prompts.

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies, their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking), a new ICL paradigm that prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel: one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent, using a single prompt with two different answers. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT), thinking twice and majority voting. Moreover, it achieves comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA reasoning method, while substantially outperforming on out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the calibration mechanism, showing the importance of structural thinking diversity and the benefits of consistency check. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL research in RLLMs.

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as collaboration and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions without requiring human annotations. However, there are two unique parts about social intelligence tasks: (1) the quality of individual utterances in social interactions is not strictly related to final success; (2) social interactions require multi-dimensional rubrics for success. Therefore, we argue that it is necessary to design rewards for building utterance-level multi-dimensional reward models to facilitate RL training for social intelligence tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment attributes outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize information in user speech related to response generation appropriately. Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them. In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 51.5% on the originals but drops by 4.7 percentage points on surface-renaming variants, and by 12.9 percentage points on parametric variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, and lack guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (e.g., book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. We introduce the concept of "design logic" and instruct LLMs to mimic human educators' question-creation process, enabling automated synthesis of large-scale, high-difficulty questions. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with source documents, we are able to create reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing datasets. Using this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. We validate our synthesized data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the Qwen3 and Llama3 model families. Our data substantially enhances their multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities, outperforming existing datasets. Notably, after SFT on our datasets, the base versions of these models even surpass their official instruction-tuned counterparts.

Abstract: While Large Language models' abilities for in-context learning (ICL) have drawn much attention, we examine some of its limitations on semantic tasks involving quantifiers like "all" and "some", as well as on tasks with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these limitations. We propose scaled signed averaging (SSA), a novel alternative to Softmax to mitigate these problems. We show that SSA significantly improves performance on our ICL tasks. In addition, SSA outperforms transformer models with Softmax on several early learning NLP benchmarks and linguistic probing tasks on zero and few-shot settings.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely evaluated on tasks such as comprehension, summarization, code generation, etc. However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of more than 17K questions in the Hindi language, comprising questionnaires from 21 diverse subjects. These questions are primarily derived from a nationwide graduate-level entrance examination covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature, philosophy, law, etc.~ specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats - such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering - alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more than 16 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Gemma3-27B attains the highest overall accuracy of 56.4\%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis indicates that even for the best-performing LLMs, performance remains weak on topics such as music, classical instruments, and law, underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning. The dataset and source code is present at https://github.com/ayushbits/ParamBench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking a learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns structured operations, including ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, and NOOP; and an Answer Agent that pre-selects and reasons over relevant entries. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management with minimal supervision. With only 152 training QA pairs, Memory-R1 outperforms strong baselines and generalizes across diverse question types, three benchmarks (LoCoMo, MSC, LongMemEval), and multiple model scales (3B-14B).

Abstract: Cognitive science research treats visual perception, the ability to understand and make sense of a visual input, as one of the early developmental signs of intelligence. Its TVPS-4 framework categorizes and tests human perception into seven skills such as visual discrimination, and form constancy. Do Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) match up to humans in basic perception? Even though there are many benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs on advanced reasoning and knowledge skills, there is limited research that focuses evaluation on simple perception. In response, we introduce Percept-V, a dataset containing 6000 program-generated uncontaminated images divided into 30 domains, where each domain tests one or more TVPS-4 skills. Our focus is on perception, so we make our domains quite simple and the reasoning and knowledge required for solving them are minimal. Since modern-day MLLMs can solve much more complex tasks, our a-priori expectation is that they will solve these domains very easily. Contrary to our belief, our experiments show a weak performance of SoTA proprietary and open-source MLLMs compared to very high human performance on Percept-V. We find that as number of objects in the image increases, performance goes down rather fast. Our experiments also identify the perception skills that are considerably harder for all models.

<title>Probe-Rewrite-Evaluate: A Workflow for Reliable Benchmarks and Quantifying Evaluation Awareness</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.

<title>From Injection to Defense: Constructing Edit-Based Fingerprints for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Fingerprinting is critical for maintaining traceability and protecting the intellectual property (IP) of developers, as LLMs deployed in web applications are susceptible to unauthorized redistribution and misuse via fine-tuning or black-box deployment. However, current backdoor-based fingerprinting methods face a fundamental trade-off: fingerprints embedded as garbled text are easily detected and filtered, whereas those crafted as coherent natural language are prone to being triggered unintentionally. To overcome these limitations, we propose RFEdit, a knowledge-editing framework that embeds a rule-based multilingual natural language fingerprint (MNLF) by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This approach enables efficient and robust fingerprint injection with minimal impact on unrelated knowledge in LLMs. Our RFEdit framework is further safeguarded by Fingerprint Subspace-aware Fine-Tuning (FSFT), which mitigates fingerprint degradation during legitimate fine-tuning by restricting parameter updates to the fingerprint subspace. This approach preserves fingerprint integrity while enhancing downstream task performance of LLMs. These advances establish a comprehensive pipeline from fingerprint injection to defense, achieving high detection effectiveness, robustness against adversarial manipulations, harmlessness to model utility, and persistence under fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFEdit maintains robustness under quantization and pruning. Additionally, fingerprint effectiveness is generally improved by more than 10\% when combined with FSFT for math and alpaca downstream tasks.

<title>Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms mitigate this issue by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, such methods typically handle knowledge as unstructured text, which reduces retrieval accuracy, hinders compositional reasoning, and amplifies the influence of irrelevant information on the factual consistency of LLM outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external knowledge retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's internal knowledge. The KG is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse Factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent gains in factual accuracy over baselines. Our findings reveal that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

Abstract: Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) addresses the challenge of detecting and removing landmines from conflict regions. Much of the life-saving operational knowledge produced by HMA agencies is buried in unstructured reports, limiting the transferability of information between agencies. To address this issue, we propose TextMine: the first dataset, evaluation framework and ontology-guided large language model (LLM) pipeline for knowledge extraction in the HMA domain. TextMine structures HMA reports into (subject, relation, object)-triples, thus creating domain-specific knowledge. To ensure real-world relevance, we created the dataset in collaboration with Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC). We further introduce a bias-aware evaluation framework that combines human-annotated triples with an LLM-as-Judge protocol to mitigate position bias in reference-free scoring. Our experiments show that ontology-aligned prompts improve extraction accuracy by up to 44.2%, reduce hallucinations by 22.5%, and enhance format adherence by 20.9% compared to baseline models. We publicly release the dataset and code.

Abstract: WARNING: This paper contains examples of offensive materials. To address the proliferation of toxic content on social media, we introduce SMARTER, we introduce SMARTER, a data-efficient two-stage framework for explainable content moderation using Large Language Models (LLMs). In Stage 1, we leverage LLMs' own outputs to generate synthetic explanations for both correct and incorrect labels, enabling alignment via preference optimization with minimal human supervision. In Stage 2, we refine explanation quality through cross-model training, allowing weaker models to align stylistically and semantically with stronger ones. Experiments on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate -- demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1 improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the full training data. Our framework offers a scalable strategy for low-resource settings by harnessing LLMs' self-improving capabilities for both classification and explanation.

<title>The Sound of Syntax: Finetuning and Comprehensive Evaluation of Language Models for Speech Pathology</title>

Abstract: According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, more than 3.4 million children experience speech disorders that require clinical intervention. The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 10\% compared to base models. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current MLMs for speech-language pathology applications, underscoring the need for further research and targeted development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated. Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity, Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close, providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Abstract: Our winning entry for the CVPR 2023 Generic Event Boundary Captioning (GEBC) competition is detailed in this paper. Unlike conventional video captioning tasks, GEBC demands that the captioning model possess an understanding of immediate changes in status around the designated video boundary, making it a difficult task. This paper proposes an effective model LLMVA-GEBC (Large Language Model with Video Adapter for Generic Event Boundary Captioning): (1) We utilize a pretrained LLM for generating human-like captions with high quality. (2) To adapt the model to the GEBC task, we take the video Q-former as an adapter and train it with the frozen visual feature extractors and LLM. Our proposed method achieved a 76.14 score on the test set and won the first place in the challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjr2000/LLMVA-GEBC .

Abstract: Launchpad is a musical instrument that allows users to create and perform music by pressing illuminated buttons. To assist and inspire the design of the Launchpad light effect, and provide a more accessible approach for beginners to create music visualization with this instrument, we proposed the LaunchpadGPT model to generate music visualization designs on Launchpad automatically. Based on the language model with excellent generation ability, our proposed LaunchpadGPT takes an audio piece of music as input and outputs the lighting effects of Launchpad-playing in the form of a video (Launchpad-playing video). We collect Launchpad-playing videos and process them to obtain music and corresponding video frame of Launchpad-playing as prompt-completion pairs, to train the language model. The experiment result shows the proposed method can create better music visualization than random generation methods and hold the potential for a broader range of music visualization applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/yunlong10/LaunchpadGPT/.

Abstract: Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed a task (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, but with some trade-offs, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech generation have been driven by large-scale training datasets. However, current models struggle to capture the spontaneity and variability inherent in real-world human speech, as they are primarily trained on audio-book datasets limited to formal, read-aloud speaking styles. To address this limitation, we introduce Emilia-Pipe, an open-source preprocessing pipeline designed to extract high-quality training data from valuable yet under-explored in-the-wild sources that capture spontaneous human speech in real-world contexts. Using Emilia-Pipe, we construct Emilia, which comprises over 101k hours of speech across six languages: English, Chinese, German, French, Japanese, and Korean. Furthermore, we expand Emilia to Emilia-Large, a dataset exceeding 216k hours, making it one of the largest open-source speech generation resources available. Extensive experiments show that Emilia-trained models produce markedly more spontaneous, human-like speech than those trained on traditional audio-book datasets, while matching their intelligibility. These models better capture diverse speaker timbres and the full spectrum of real-world conversational styles. Our work also highlights the importance of scaling dataset size for advancing speech generation performance and validates the effectiveness of Emilia for both multilingual and crosslingual speech generation tasks.

Abstract: Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly manipulates the model's internal representations. As a result, it may offer more effective, interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models' behavior. We present the first comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to address key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control. We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, including managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models' performance. Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological improvements and construct a guide for best practices.

Abstract: As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.

Abstract: This work presents a dual-agent \ac{llm}-based reasoning framework for automated planar mechanism synthesis that tightly couples linguistic specification with symbolic representation and simulation. From a natural-language task description, the system composes symbolic constraints and equations, generates and parametrises simulation code, and iteratively refines designs via critic-driven feedback, including symbolic regression and geometric distance metrics, closing an actionable linguistic/symbolic optimisation loop. To evaluate the approach, we introduce MSynth, a benchmark of analytically defined planar trajectories. Empirically, critic feedback and iterative refinement yield large improvements (up to 90\% on individual tasks) and statistically significant gains per the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Symbolic-regression prompts provide deeper mechanistic insight primarily when paired with larger models or architectures with appropriate inductive biases (e.g., LRM).

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP! Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/roboflow/rf100-vl and https://universe.roboflow.com/rf100-vl/.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

Abstract: As AI models generate increasingly realistic images, growing concerns over potential misuse underscore the need for reliable detection. Traditional supervised detection methods depend on large, curated datasets for training and often fail to generalize to novel, out-of-domain image generators. As an alternative, we explore pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. We evaluate VLM performance on three diverse benchmarks encompassing synthetic images of human faces, objects, and animals produced by 16 different state-of-the-art image generators. While off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these datasets, we find that their reasoning can be guided effectively through simple response prefilling -- a method we call Prefill-Guided Thinking (PGT). In particular, prefilling a VLM response with the task-aligned phrase "Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts" improves the Macro F1 scores of three widely used open-source VLMs by up to 24%.

<title>Enhancing Few-shot Keyword Spotting Performance through Pre-Trained Self-supervised Speech Models</title>

Abstract: Keyword Spotting plays a critical role in enabling hands-free interaction for battery-powered edge devices. Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FS-KWS) addresses the scalability and adaptability challenges of traditional systems by enabling recognition of custom keywords with only a few examples. However, existing FS-KWS systems achieve subpar accuracy at desirable false acceptance rates, particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. To address these issues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learning models for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge distillation. The teacher model, based on Wav2Vec 2.0 is trained using Sub-center ArcFace loss, which enhances inter-class separability and intra-class compactness. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, we introduce attention-based dimensionality reduction and train a standard lightweight ResNet15 student model. We evaluate the proposed approach on the English portion of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) and the Google Speech Commands (GSC) datasets. Notably, the proposed training method improves the 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on 11 classes at 1% false alarm accuracy on the GSC dataset, thus making it significantly better-suited for a real use case scenario.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Abstract: This thesis investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can be guided to simulate a consistent personality through prompt engineering. The study explores this concept within the context of a chatbot designed for Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) student training, specifically focused on gender-affirming voice therapy. The chatbot, named Monae Jackson, was created to represent a 32-year-old transgender woman and engage in conversations simulating client-therapist interactions. Findings suggest that with prompt engineering, the chatbot maintained a recognizable and consistent persona and had a distinct personality based on the Big Five Personality test. These results support the idea that prompt engineering can be used to simulate stable personality characteristics in AI chatbots.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots.

<div> active visual referencing, reasoning, image processing, multimodal reasoning, grounding

Summary: 
The study addresses the limitation of existing models in processing images only once during reasoning by introducing v1, a lightweight extension enabling active visual referencing. This approach allows the model to identify relevant image patches and incorporate them back into the reasoning stream, ensuring hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. The pointing strategy of v1 enables direct selection of image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, a dataset v1g of multimodal reasoning traces with visual grounding annotations is introduced. The v1 model consistently outperforms comparable baselines across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available for further exploration.

Abstract: When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available at github.com/jun297/v1.

Summary:
This paper explores algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, specifically focusing on gender and race/ethnicity disparities. Deep neural network (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs) using clinical interview transcripts from the DAIC-WOZ dataset. LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, especially for Hispanic participants, while also showing reduced gender bias. However, racial disparities persist in LLMs. Fairness-aware techniques such as worst-group loss show promise in mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, while guided prompting with ethical framing helps reduce gender bias in LLMs with 1-shot learning. Increasing the number of shots does not further reduce disparities. Strategies for race/ethnicity disparities in LLMs are less effective, suggesting the need for more research in this area. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities.

Task oriented dialogue systems aim to complete tasks based on user preferences through natural language interactions. This paper introduces a model that focuses on effective goal-aware planning in task-oriented conversations by incorporating constructive intermediate information. Predefined slots and text part informational components are used to model user preferences, while critical circumstances are identified to create limited information states. Dialogue moves are defined to indicate movement between these states and the procedures involved. An update strategy is also constructed. Leveraging in-context learning of large language models, the model uses database queries based on predefined slots and the order of retrieved entities to pass corresponding entities in the order of congruency. Evaluation on MultiWOZ dataset shows improved performance in terms of inform and success metrics compared to previous methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible configurations for these informational components lead to limited information states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created. Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model,  database queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ, with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is crucial for assessing the performance of MT systems. In this study, a reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati was developed using supervised learning. Two models with different hidden layers were trained using 25 features. The performance of the metric was tested using 1000 MT outputs from seven systems compared to a human reference translation. The developed metrics showed stronger human correlations compared to other existing metrics. This research highlights the need for language-specific evaluation metrics to improve MT performance in Indian languages like Gujarati. <div>

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been identified that what works for English and other European languages does not work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with 500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500 epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, hallucination, artificial general intelligence, Closed World assumption, Open World assumption

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong linguistic capabilities but often produce inaccurate outputs known as "hallucinations." Engineering approaches usually view hallucination as a flaw to be minimized, while formal analyses suggest it is theoretically inevitable. This paper redefines hallucination as a manifestation of the generalization problem, which is crucial for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Under the Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions align, hallucinations can be reduced. However, under the Open World assumption with an unbounded environment, hallucinations become unavoidable. The paper classifies hallucinations into correctable and unavoidable categories under open-world conditions. It argues that hallucination should not be seen solely as an engineering defect but as a structural aspect to be managed and harmonized with human intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''. Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability. Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes ``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent, hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however, where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework, CARE, for enhancing the logical coherence and supportive quality of Emotional Support Conversations (ESC). Unlike previous studies that focus on data augmentation, CARE emphasizes strengthening the cognitive reasoning processes essential for effective emotional support. By utilizing the original ESC dataset and leveraging reinforcement learning, CARE guides models in generating more logically coherent and supportive responses. Experimental results show that CARE significantly improves the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, leading to the development of more empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support systems. <div>

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses, thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation, we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support systems.

<div> Keywords: MADS, multi-agent dialogue simulation, persuasion strategies, optimization, user data <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The proposed framework MADS aims to generate persuasive multi-turn dialogues through agent self-play. It involves three agents - User Agents simulating diverse behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing persuasion strategies, and an Optimization Agent evaluating outcomes. MADS eliminates the need for human annotation by generating training data at a low cost. It addresses industry challenges such as lack of user data and prompt inefficiency. The framework was validated using Chain-of-Attitude modeling and LLMs' persuasion assessment. In a real-world marketing scenario, MADS improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, leading to a significant increase in the organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4%. This demonstrates the business value of MADS in enhancing dialogue generation and persuasion techniques. <div>

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) , demonstrating clear business value.

<div> Collaborative filtering, Large Language Models (LLMs), recommendation systems, IDIOMoE, item interaction histories<br />
Summary: Collaborative filtering and Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for recommendation systems, but combining their strengths is challenging. The IDIOMoE method introduced in this paper integrates collaborative signals with natural language processing by treating item interaction histories as a native dialect in the language space. By separating the Feed Forward Network of a pretrained LLM into text and item experts with token-type gating, IDIOMoE achieves strong recommendation performance while maintaining the text understanding capabilities of the model. This approach enables a unified framework for recommendation systems that can handle natural-language queries and provide transparent explanations to users. <div>
arXiv:2510.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency, and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning, modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations, further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID + Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained model.

<div> supervised finetuning, large language models, uncertainty communication, metacognitive tasks, calibration error <br />
Summary: <br />
Large language models (LLMs) often lack accurate uncertainty communication, leading to potential errors in decision-making. This study explores how supervised finetuning can enhance LLMs' ability to convey uncertainty in various tasks and domains. Finetuning on datasets from different domains improved calibration and discrimination of uncertainty signals without impacting accuracy. However, the effectiveness of training on specific metacognitive tasks varied, with multitask finetuning yielding broader improvements in out-of-domain evaluations. The results highlight the importance of developing multiple metacognitive skills concurrently through multitask training for improved uncertainty communication in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation, where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration (alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains, while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific: training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable, different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must be developed together through multitask training.

<div> Keywords: automated assessment, cognitive-linguistic impairment, visual narrative path, BERT-based pipeline, content information units (CIUs)

Summary: 
- The study introduces a BERT-based pipeline for automated extraction and ordering of content information units (CIUs) in picture descriptions for cognitive-linguistic impairment assessment.
- The pipeline achieves high performance with 93% median precision and 96% median recall in CIU detection, and a 24% sequence error rate.
- Extracted features from the pipeline show strong correlations with ground truth and outperform dictionary-based baselines in external validation.
- The proposed method is effective in characterizing visual narrative paths for cognitive impairment assessment.
- The implementation and models of the pipeline are open-sourced to the public. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units (CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24% sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models open-sourced to public.

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First, we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869 for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content standards.}

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces In-context learning (ICL) as an efficient few-shot learning method in large language models (LLMs) without requiring additional training.
- ICL suffers from the quadratic input complexity of transformers, limiting the number of exemplars that can be processed.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process (e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance across model scales.

Summary:<br />
This article addresses the challenges faced by Head Start programs using the GoEngage platform in locating appropriate Tasks due to domain-specific jargon and system-specific nomenclature. The proposed solution is a hybrid semantic search system that combines typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, vector similarity, and large language model re-ranking. The approach leverages existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure while focusing on trustworthiness, evolvability, and economic efficiency. The framework includes required resources, implementation strategy, evaluation protocol, and measurement methodology. By ensuring low false-positive rates, accommodation of terminological changes, and efficient mechanisms such as caching and shortlist generation, the system aims to improve the user experience and streamline the task location process. In offline evaluations and online measurements, metrics like Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, zero-result rates, and dwell-time proxies are used to assess the system's performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA, DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity, and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates, and dwell-time proxies.

<div> LLMs, scaling, reasoning paths, diverse, accurate <br />
Summary: 
This article discusses the challenge of generating diverse and accurate reasoning paths in Large Language Models (LLMs) by treating parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem. The authors propose Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), a method that incorporates a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching, preserving unique reasoning modes and producing emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SSFT consistently outperforms SFT in terms of both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics. The traditional strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a trade-off between diversity and accuracy due to the deep forking tokens in the sampling tree. SSFT addresses this challenge by maintaining diverse reasoning modes while improving accuracy, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach in enhancing performance in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree. Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy. Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that, while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT), preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Summary:
- Models were evaluated on various synthetic-to-external data ratios across different scales using the Pythia model suite.
- Models maintain stable performance with up to 20% synthetic data but degrade beyond 30%, with larger models showing more robustness.
- Calibration degradation occurs before accuracy loss, serving as an early warning signal.
- Reasoning tasks degrade faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training.
- Best practices such as those in STaR and Self-Instruct systems, which use over 80% external data, are within safe regimes based on the study's findings.
- Practical guidance for practitioners on synthetic data budgets considering model scale and task requirements is provided.
- Comparison with concurrent work, including Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings, is detailed. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from 0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to 20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models (6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models (410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments. We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each other.

Summary: 
AI-generated text produced by large language models exhibits linguistic features such as a formal and impersonal style, with an abundance of nouns and determiners but fewer adjectives and adverbs. The text also shows lower lexical diversity, smaller vocabulary size, and repetitiveness. Current research primarily focuses on English data and the GPT model family, indicating a need for more diverse cross-linguistic and cross-model investigations. Additionally, there is a lack of exploration into prompt sensitivity in text generation, highlighting the potential for future studies to employ multiple prompt wordings. This survey paper synthesizes existing research on AI-generated text to provide a comprehensive overview of the trends and findings in the field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed, and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers. Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation phase.

Summary: WebDetective introduces a benchmark for multi-hop questions without hints, paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox for traceability. The evaluation framework assesses search sufficiency, knowledge utilization, and refusal behavior separately. State-of-the-art models show weaknesses in knowledge utilization and refusal behaviors, despite having sufficient evidence. They struggle to autonomously discover reasoning paths and excel at following given paths. EvidenceLoop, an agentic workflow, addresses these challenges with verification loops and evidence tracking. WebDetective serves as a tool for developing truly autonomous reasoning systems by guiding architectural improvements based on diagnostic insights from the benchmark. <div>
arXiv:2510.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation, and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow, EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies, incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of automated scientific writing.

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral, spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

Summary: 
The article discusses how people make predictions about upcoming words while listening to or reading a sentence and how large language models (LLMs) are being explored as cognitive models of human linguistic prediction. It highlights that as language models improve in predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading behavior has declined due to their 'superhuman' prediction capabilities. This superhumanness is attributed to LLMs having stronger long-term memory and better short-term memory compared to humans. The paper advocates for the development of models with human-like long-term and short-term memory and suggests possible directions to achieve this. It also emphasizes the need for human experiments to measure progress towards this goal, as current human data is deemed insufficient. <div>

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs), which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words, mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human experiments that can address this gap.

<div> Keywords: data-driven materials discovery, information extraction pipeline, composition-processing-microstructure-property relationships, large language models, materials informatics

Summary: 
Data-driven materials discovery relies on large-scale experimental datasets, but much information is dispersed in unstructured literature. This study proposes a multi-stage information extraction pipeline, utilizing large language models to capture 47 features related to materials composition, processing, microstructure, and properties from experimental reports. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to enhance accuracy and reliability. Evaluations demonstrate high F1 scores at both the feature and tuple levels. Compared to single-pass extraction without source tracking, the approach significantly improves the extraction of microstructure attributes and reduces missed materials. The pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, yielding databases with high precision, minimal omissions, and no false positives. These datasets serve as reliable inputs for machine learning and materials informatics, with a modular design suitable for various material classes, enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets, yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature. Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing, microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level (independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1 scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0% (feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49 to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes, enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

<div> Resource, Critical Error Detection, Machine Translation, SynCED-EnDe, Dataset 

Summary: 
The article introduces SynCED-EnDe, a new dataset for Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation. This dataset addresses the limitations of previous benchmarks by providing a larger scale, balanced labels, diverse sources, and enhanced annotations. SynCED-EnDe consists of 1,000 gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, with explicit error subclasses and fine-grained auxiliary judgments. This allows for detailed analysis of error risk and complexity beyond binary detection. The dataset is available on GitHub and Hugging Face, along with documentation and baseline scripts. Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show significant performance improvements over previous benchmarks. The goal is to advance the safe deployment of machine translation in information retrieval and conversational assistants, especially in new contexts like wearable AI devices. <div>

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000 gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources (StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity, localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face, accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts. Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

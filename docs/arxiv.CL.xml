<div> Keywords: Large decoder-only language models, Retrieval augmented generation, Generative Embedding large language Model, Text embeddings, NLP benchmarks

Summary:
Generative Embedding large language Model (GEM) is a self-supervised approach proposed to enhance large decoder-only language models (LLMs) by enabling them to generate high-quality text embeddings. By inserting special tokens into text and manipulating attention masks, LLMs can generate summarization embeddings seamlessly. This approach can be easily integrated into existing LLMs during post-training or fine-tuning stages. Experimental results on popular LLM families ranging from 1B to 8B parameters show that GEM significantly improves LLMs on text embedding benchmarks (MTEB) while maintaining minimal impact on NLP benchmarks (MMLU). This demonstrates that GEM can empower LLMs with advanced text embedding capabilities without sacrificing their original performance in natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation (RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings, which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB) and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original NLP performance

<div> Keywords: automatic speech recognition, accents, robustness, low-resource training, diversity

Summary:
Increasing the number of speakers in training data for automatic speech recognition systems is more beneficial than increasing the hours contributed per speaker. A higher number of speakers allows for better performance gains as the training data scales. Prioritizing speakers with different accents does not show significant benefits when the number of speakers is controlled. Therefore, practitioners should focus on increasing the diversity of speakers in ASR training data composition for new languages. This study highlights the importance of considering the number of speakers and their diversity in training data to improve ASR robustness towards unseen accents in low-resource settings. <div>
arXiv:2506.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers (which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for new languages.

Summary: 
- Sentence embeddings are essential in NLP and AI, but their internal structures are not well understood. 
- Current methods for comparing embeddings lack interpretability due to complex neural transformations. 
- A new method is proposed to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations. 
- The analysis reveals how pooling combines token features into sentence representations, shedding light on latent features within sentence embeddings. 
- The study uncovers insights such as linear encoding of semantic and syntactic aspects in sentence embeddings.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations, and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies, we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.

<div> Hierarchical Text Classification, Contrastive Learning, Path guided hierarchy, Label hierarchy, Improved performance<br />
Summary:<br />
Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) is a valuable tool for complex label hierarchies in various domains. Existing models either encode hierarchy separately or guide it in text encoding. The proposed model, HTC-CLIP, utilizes contrastive learning to learn hierarchy-aware text representation and text-informed path guided hierarchy representation. During training, two sets of class probabilities are learned, resulting in improved performance by combining the strengths of both approaches. Testing on benchmark datasets shows a significant improvement in Macro F1 score compared to existing state-of-the-art models. By effectively integrating different approaches, HTC-CLIP showcases the potential for enhanced hierarchical text classification outcomes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Summary:<br />
- Evaluation of 55 large language models on Maltese shows limited effectiveness for low-resource languages.
- Experiments on 11 tasks reveal poor performance on generative tasks, with smaller fine-tuned models performing better overall.
- Factors impacting performance include prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning.
- Trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting are discussed, highlighting better performance and lower inference costs with fine-tuning.
- The study advocates for more inclusive language technologies and suggests researchers consider traditional language modeling approaches for low-resource languages.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training. However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling approaches.

Summary:  
- Customer care is crucial in e-commerce, with companies investing in automation and human agents across channels, geographies, and languages.  
- Domain-specific models like multilingual-BERT perform well in Customer Care tasks but require annotated data.  
- Data availability limits model performance, necessitating a solution for generalizing with few annotations across domains.  
- The proposed model architecture extends domain-specific models to new domains with minimal labeled samples.  
- Fine-tuning with isotropic regularizers and multilingual knowledge distillation enables the model to generalize across multiple domains, enhancing accuracy by 20-23% in Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care datasets.  

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels (like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English, Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language) with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

<title>Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning</title>

<div> transformer language models, LET-ALONE construction, syntactic properties, semantic properties, sample efficiency <br />
Summary:  
The study investigates the generalization ability of human-scale transformer language models on the English LET-ALONE construction, focusing on both form and meaning. While the models demonstrate sensitivity to the form of the construction even when related constructions are absent, they fail to make accurate generalizations about the meaning of LET-ALONE. This suggests an asymmetry in the models' sample efficiency between language form and meaning, unlike human language learners who excel in both areas. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding how language models process and generalize rare constructions, shedding light on their capabilities and limitations in linguistic tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However, it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However, human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning. These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in human language learners.

Summary:
Entity structure extraction plays a crucial role in text understanding and knowledge graph construction. Traditional methods relying on predefined schemas or annotated datasets often lead to incomplete results. To address this issue, the Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity Structure Discovery (ZOES) approach is introduced. ZOES does not require any schema or annotated samples, utilizing an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism based on the relationship between entities and their structures. Experiments show that ZOES significantly improves the completeness of entity structure extraction, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability. This approach provides a principled method to enhance the quality of entity structure discovery using large language models in various scenarios.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results. To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing. Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains, showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity structure discovery in various scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Watermarking, Large language models, Alignment properties, Alignment Resampling, Gumbel and KGW approaches

Summary: 
This paper examines the impact of watermarking techniques on the alignment properties of large language models (LLMs). Two popular watermarking approaches, Gumbel and KGW, were analyzed across four LLMs, revealing degradation patterns that affect model safety, helpfulness, and truthfulness. To address these issues, Alignment Resampling (AR) is proposed as an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. Theoretical bounds and empirical evidence show that AR effectively recovers or surpasses baseline alignment scores by sampling watermarked generations. By sacrificing strict distortion-freeness in modified Gumbel watermarking, AR maintains strong watermark detectability while restoring alignment. Experimental results confirm AR's success in recovering baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches. This study underscores the importance of balancing watermark strength with model alignment and offers a practical solution for responsibly deploying watermarked LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability, ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

<div> Keywords: preference feedback, large language models, user-generated content, implicit preferences, scalable alignment <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new framework called PUGC that utilizes implicit human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate preference data for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. By transforming UGC into user queries, PUGC generates responses from the model and leverages the UGC as a reference text for response scoring. Experimental results demonstrate a 9.37% performance improvement and a state-of-the-art win rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. The approach enhances the quality of preference data, enables scalable domain-specific alignment, improves reward quality, effectiveness in domain-specific alignment, robustness against UGC quality, and theory of mind capabilities. The code and dataset for PUGC are also made available, allowing for further experimentation and development in this area. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable, domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC quality, and theory of mind capabilities.

SQLens is a framework designed to detect and correct semantic errors in SQL queries generated by large language models for the text-to-SQL task. It leverages error signals from both the database and the language model to identify potential errors within SQL clauses and guide query correction.

arXiv:2506.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction. Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Summary: 
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation) is introduced as a method to combine the strengths of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for more reliable results in ambiguous scenarios. The Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method enhances integration by using SLM-generated insights to guide LLM evaluations and adjusting scores for improved accuracy. Experimental results show that DRE outperforms existing methods and aligns more closely with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining small and large models in creating more reliable evaluation tools, particularly in open-ended tasks such as dialogue evaluation. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods, showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue evaluation.

<div> decomposition, translation, language models, reasoning, Chain-of-Thought

Summary:
The study investigates the effectiveness of a multi-step prompt strategy in improving translation performance using Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous research proposed a hand-crafted prompt approach for decomposing translation tasks, leading to state-of-the-art results. However, the current study finds no clear evidence that the performance gains are directly attributed to the decomposition strategy. Surprisingly, prompting LLMs to "translate again" yields even better results than the human-like step-by-step approach. The analysis suggests that the role of reasoning in the translation process may need further exploration. The findings challenge the assumption that explicit decomposition of tasks is crucial for improving LLM-based translation performance. Future research should delve deeper into understanding the factors contributing to the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought reasoning in the context of translation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's effectiveness in the context of translation.

<div> discourse particles, fine-grained senses, LLMs, semantics, language understanding
Summary:
Discourse particles play a crucial role in shaping text meaning by introducing nuanced semantic/discourse effects. This study focuses on the word "just" in English, known for its various senses like exclusive, temporal, and emphatic. The research examines Language Models (LLMs) to see their ability to differentiate between the subtle nuances of "just". While LLMs show some proficiency in distinguishing broader categories, they struggle to fully capture the finer distinctions in the meanings of discourse particles. This highlights a gap in their understanding of these elements and suggests a need for further development in this area. <div>

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just", a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of discourse particles.

Summary: 
The article proposes the idea of benchmarking Language Model models (LLMs) on questions that have no reasonable answer. They introduce a new benchmark for such testing and a method to modify existing datasets to accommodate these types of questions. The study reveals that current LLMs exhibit a significant gap in performance when faced with questions that are deemed impossible to answer. By providing their code and data artifacts for others to access, the researchers aim to encourage further exploration and improvement in this area. This approach challenges the conventional notion of benchmarking and opens up new possibilities for evaluating the capabilities of language models beyond the scope of traditional tasks. <div>

arXiv:2506.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings. While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues, they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13 African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released under open licenses to support future research.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in various tasks, while Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have potential for enabling cooperation among distributed agents. However, MAS could be vulnerable to integrity attacks where malicious agents manipulate prompts to bias system operations. Four types of attacks are explored: Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, and Free-Rider, each aimed at misleading system monitors and manipulating collaborative agents. Strategic prompt manipulation can introduce biases and enable malicious agents to mislead evaluation systems, even bypassing advanced LLM-based monitors. This highlights the need for MAS architectures with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, along with monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk assessment. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning. Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions; \textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others. We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents. Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

<div> Keywords: large language models, financial sentiment analysis, reasoning, System 1, System 2

Summary:<br />
The study evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. Different LLMs and prompting strategies are compared, including reasoning-based and non-reasoning models. Proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) and smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone) are analyzed under various prompting paradigms. Surprisingly, the study finds that reasoning, whether through prompting or inherent model design, does not necessarily improve performance in financial sentiment analysis. The most accurate model was GPT-4o without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Performance is also impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, suggesting that overthinking due to reasoning can lead to suboptimal predictions. The research challenges the belief that more reasoning always results in better LLM decisions, particularly in the realm of high-stakes financial applications.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate) thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions. This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive "System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to "System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes financial applications.

<title>Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?</title>

<div> Keywords: Neuro-symbolic approaches, large language models, logical reasoning, lexically diversified text, benchmarking<br />
Summary:<br />
Neuro-symbolic approaches that combine large language models (LLMs) with solvers for logical reasoning face challenges in handling lexical diversification in natural language. Existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack diversity, making it difficult to evaluate LLMs' translation capabilities accurately. To address this gap, the SCALe benchmark introduces lexically diversified but logically equivalent datasets to test LLMs' ability to map varied expressions to uniform logical symbols. Results show current LLMs struggle in this task. The proposed MenTaL method aims to improve translation by guiding LLMs to create a unified table of diverse expressions before proceeding with translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning enhances LLM performance on lexically diversified text. The experimental code is accessible at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

<div> In-Context Learning, Large Language Models, Rapid Task Adaptation, Demonstration Selection, Many-Shot Demonstrations

Summary:
In this study, the authors address the challenge of selecting demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs). They propose a novel gradient matching approach to select examples by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the target task training set and the selected examples to mimic the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected examples. The method consistently outperforms random selection on smaller LLMs across various datasets in 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios. It achieves a 4% improvement on larger LLMs like Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and around 2% on closed-source LLMs. This advancement in Many-Shot ICL unlocks more reliable and effective task adaptation without the need for Fine-Tuning, expanding its potential applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios, we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g., Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method called SUCEA for automatic fact-checking to address challenges in tackling adversarial claims. The framework consists of three main steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction. SUCEA aims to rephrase adversarial claims to make it easier to locate supporting evidence for fact-checking. Experimental results on two fact-checking datasets show that SUCEA outperforms four claim-decomposition-based baselines in both retrieval accuracy and entailment label prediction accuracy. This method is training-free and significantly improves the performance of fact-checking systems in handling challenging claims designed to deceive fact-checking systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label. Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

The article introduces a new benchmark called MuSciClaims for assessing scientific claims by utilizing multimodal data from figures in scientific literature. Supported and contradicted claims are automatically extracted from articles to test claim verification abilities. Most vision-language models perform poorly on the benchmark, achieving F1 scores ranging from 0.3 to 0.77. Models tend to exhibit bias towards judging claims as supported and struggle with localizing evidence within figures, aggregating information across modalities, and comprehending basic components of the figures. Diagnostic tasks are introduced to investigate model failures and provide insight into areas for improvement in multimodal reasoning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning, and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of the figure.

Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce a formal verification framework called $Safe$ to address the issue of hallucinations in language models induced by Chain-of-Thought prompting. They propose articulating mathematical claims in formal language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and providing formal proofs to identify hallucinations, offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. The framework is evaluated across various language models and mathematical datasets, showing significant performance improvement. The authors also introduce $FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving. This work is the first to leverage formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by language models, aligning with the purpose of formal mathematical languages to provide a solid foundation for human-written proofs prone to hallucination. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose $FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$ formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles. Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS) domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED. The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY, ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark, we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI relation between them in model training improves their performance on scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Summary:
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods enhance the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allocating extra compute during inference. These methods are categorized into sampling-based, search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. However, reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, limiting the effectiveness of TTS. To address this issue, the ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix fine-Tuning) method is proposed, which incorporates prefix tuning with a focus on diversity in data. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that ADAPT achieves 80% accuracy using significantly less compute compared to strong baselines. These results emphasize the importance of generative diversity in maximizing the effectiveness of Test-Time Scaling.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based, search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however, enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team assembly and research policy.

<div> Keywords: static word embeddings, sentence semantic representation, principal component analysis, knowledge distillation, contrastive learning

Summary:<br /><br />
The article proposes new static word embeddings optimized for representing sentence semantics effectively. The approach involves extracting word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer and enhancing them with sentence-level principal component analysis, followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During inference, sentences are represented by averaging word embeddings, requiring minimal computational cost. Evaluation on monolingual and cross-lingual tasks demonstrates that the model outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks and can even rival a basic Sentence Transformer model in some datasets. Additionally, analyses show that the method successfully removes irrelevant word embedding components related to sentence semantics and adjusts vector norms based on word influence on sentence semantics. <div>

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis, followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

Summary:
Tool-MVR is a novel Tool-Augmented LLM that addresses limitations in current language models. It introduces Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) to validate APIs and reasoning trajectories, creating a high-quality instruction dataset (ToolBench-V). Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) enhances tool reflection capabilities through a dynamic learning paradigm. By finetuning on ToolBench-V and a reflection dataset (ToolBench-R), Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing other models while reducing API calls. It also excels on RefineToolBench, demonstrating a high error correction rate, indicating its strong tool reflection abilities. <div>
arXiv:2506.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems. However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g., widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities (over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE), which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%, with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios. Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9% error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features. Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly under-resourced ones.

<br />
Summary: TaDA is a training-free method for compressing the key-value (KV) cache in transformer models by adapting quantization precision to error sensitivity across layers and mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. This approach improves accuracy for models with various context lengths and reduces the KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. By addressing the challenge of managing sparse and noncontiguous outliers, TaDA enables scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models, potentially facilitating inference for longer context length models and enhancing reasoning capability. This method opens up possibilities for deploying larger language models efficiently and handling longer chains of thoughts effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and longer chain of thoughts.

<div> Evaluation, Language Models, Planning, Flexibility, Constraints
<br />
The article introduces Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark to assess language models' ability to adapt in dynamic planning scenarios. It presents two evaluation settings: sequential constraint introduction and scenarios with competing constraints. Analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B shows that performance on single-turn tasks does not predict adaptability across multiple turns. The order of constraint introduction significantly impacts performance, and models struggle with constraint prioritization, often favoring lower-priority constraints over higher-priority ones. This highlights the importance of evaluating language models in realistic, dynamic planning scenarios to improve their performance on complex tasks.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner}, we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

<div> alignment, language models, AI, norms, adversarial attacks

Summary:
The article discusses the value alignment problem for large language models (LLMs) in the field of artificial intelligence. Current alignment strategies aimed at instilling norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through fine-tuning based on human preferences are deemed inadequate in preventing misuse. The vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks is attributed to the reinforcement of shallow behavioral dispositions rather than fostering a genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Unlike humans who engage in deliberative reasoning to resolve normative conflicts, LLMs lack this ability, making them susceptible to manipulation. This "shallow alignment" issue poses significant challenges for AI safety and regulation, highlighting the insufficiency of current approaches in mitigating potential harms posed by advanced AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2506.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods: they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<div> keywords: pre-training, language models, data scaling, data enrichment, synthetic data<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the challenges of scaling up pre-training language models due to limited high-quality data sources. They introduce a method called REWIRE, which enriches low-quality documents discarded in filtering processes to increase the amount of useful data for training. Experiments conducted at different scales show that mixing high-quality raw texts with rewritten texts leads to performance improvements across various tasks. The approach of recycling web texts outperforms other methods of generating synthetic data and is more effective than simply increasing the amount of web data. The analysis shows that a significant portion of the data used for training comes from transforming lower-quality documents that would have been discarded otherwise. The results indicate that recycling web texts could be a simple and effective way to enhance pre-training data and improve the performance of large language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Summary: 
This study addresses the challenge of detecting implicit hate speech (im-HS) on the internet, which is often more subtle than explicit hate speech. The researchers propose a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, introducing six encoding strategies called codetypes. They present two methods for integrating codetypes into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) to classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments conducted on Chinese and English datasets show that incorporating codetypes improves the detection of im-HS. This validation across different languages demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing im-HS detection on online platforms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets, validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search. However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources, creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy. Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module, combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by 48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation quality in terms of BLEU.

<div> algorithm, collective alignment, multiple LLMs, competition, combat

Summary:
SPARTA ALIGNMENT is an algorithm that aims to collectively align multiple LLMs through competition and combat. Multiple LLMs form a "sparta tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions and serving as judges for the competition of others. In each iteration, one instruction and two models engage in a duel, with the other models evaluating their responses. The evaluation scores are aggregated using an elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners and losers gain or lose weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results create preference pairs, allowing all models to learn from these preferences. Through extensive experiments, SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and self-alignment baselines across various tasks and datasets, demonstrating an average improvement of 7.0%. The algorithm also exhibits effective generalization to unseen tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce more logical, direct, and informative outputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one, and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration. SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce more logical, direct and informative outputs.

It combines the generalization power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the classification expertise of Small Language Models (SLMs) through a multi-round collaborative learning approach. A lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture is used to incrementally update LLMs, while a replay-based continue learning method ensures SLMs retain prior knowledge without retraining entirely. The framework significantly outperforms existing methods in detecting fake news on datasets like Pheme and Twitter16, improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges. The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods, effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios.

<div> Keywords: text revision, evaluation metrics, NLP, manual annotation, LLM-as-a-judge<br />
Summary:<br />
The study focuses on evaluating text revision in scientific writing and identifies the limitations of traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore. It explores alternative evaluation methods aligning with human judgments, including manual annotation and reference-free metrics from NLP. The research also investigates LLM-as-a-judge approaches for assessing revisions with and without a gold reference. Results indicate that LLMs can effectively evaluate instruction-following but struggle with assessing correctness. Domain-specific metrics offer additional insights, and a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics is deemed the most reliable for assessing revision quality.<br />

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains. Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Summary:<br />
The study examines political opinions of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing their internal mechanisms and intentions. It addresses the misalignment between LLM responses and their true political states by developing a four-dimensional political learning framework and dataset for fine-grained concept vector learning. By extending from single-axis to multi-dimensions, the study aims to disentangle political concept confounds in LLMs using interpretable representation engineering techniques. Experiments conducted on eight open-source LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of the learned political concept vectors in detecting and intervening in LLM internals. These vectors show good generalization and robustness in out-of-distribution settings and are able to generate responses with different political leanings, showcasing their potential for influencing LLM behavior. <div>

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Summary: 
MMSU introduces a benchmark for evaluating comprehension and reasoning in spoken language, encompassing 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks. The benchmark includes various linguistic aspects such as phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, and semantics. Assessment of 14 Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) on MMSU reveals areas for model enhancement, indicating the need for future optimizations in natural speech processing. The MMSU benchmark aims to set a new standard for evaluating spoken language understanding and improve human-AI speech interaction systems. The benchmark and evaluation code are publicly available, providing valuable insights for developing more advanced speech processing technologies.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content), paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics, semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models, highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding, providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ddwang2000/MMSU. Evaluation Code is available at https://github.com/dingdongwang/MMSU_Bench.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained foundations.

Summary:<br />
- The study introduces a new evaluation framework called FineLogic to assess logical reasoning in large language models.
- The framework evaluates reasoning across three dimensions: benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment.
- Supervision format during fine-tuning plays a significant role in the reasoning capabilities of language models.
- Natural language supervision leads to strong generalization, even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks.
- Symbolic reasoning styles promote structurally sound and atomic inference chains in language models.
- Representation-level probing reveals that fine-tuning enhances reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation rather than shortcut prediction or internalized correctness.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition, to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs.

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces a hybrid approach for machine translation proofreading using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The CNN utilizes convolution kernel filters to analyze local n-gram patterns and extract semantic information from phrases and expressions. BERT generates rich contextual representations of sequences to detect translation irregularities like word order problems and omissions. The error detection component uses BERT's attention mechanisms to identify errors, while a correction module proposes logical modifications using parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models. The model is trained on English-German parallel corpora from WMT and Open-Subtitles and achieves high accuracy, F1 score, and mean squared error compared to existing proofreading techniques. Overall, the proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in detecting and correcting mistranslations and omissions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying mistranslations and omissions.

The study evaluates the use of vision-language and large language models in assessing handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in Indonesian schools. The state-of-the-art models were tested on more than 14K student answers in Mathematics and English. The results showed that the VLM struggled with accurately recognizing student handwriting, leading to errors in downstream LLM grading. Despite this, LLM-generated feedback still had some utility, albeit with limitations in personalization and contextual relevance. The study highlights the challenges in using advanced AI models for educational assessment in real-world classroom settings, particularly in underrepresented educational contexts.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools, covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than 14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Summary:  
An LLM-based reasoning system has been developed to solve cryptic crossword clues, which are challenging language tasks involving both the definition of the answer and wordplay. The system hypothesizes answers, proposes explanations for wordplay, and utilizes a verifier system for reasoning steps. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. The solutions provided are in Python, allowing for interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers. This system addresses the complexity of cryptic crossword clues and provides a reliable way to solve them without needing confirmation from crossing words. <div>
arXiv:2506.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for inspection.

<title>Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit, multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines, offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis, monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization) between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are released to the community.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational materials and question answering, but there are still space for new applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM, but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations, giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience, providing valuable insights for the future.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10, and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and 6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2) A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts. Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text, struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty. Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths, despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge work.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when the language in question was not present in the original training data. The fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better performance with limited training data. This combination allows better utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore 352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice, and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual, LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications, which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging university-level algorithms exams. By testing multiple models on both a Romanian exam and its high-quality English translation, we analyze LLMs' problem-solving capabilities, consistency, and multilingual performance. Our empirical study reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student feedback. The insights and best practices discussed herein pave the way for further integration of generative AI in advanced algorithm education.

<title>Better Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-domain ASR Through Incremental Retraining and Data Filtering</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4% over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower computational cost.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Abstract: We introduce ComfyUI-Copilot, a large language model-powered plugin designed to enhance the usability and efficiency of ComfyUI, an open-source platform for AI-driven art creation. Despite its flexibility and user-friendly interface, ComfyUI can present challenges to newcomers, including limited documentation, model misconfigurations, and the complexity of workflow design. ComfyUI-Copilot addresses these challenges by offering intelligent node and model recommendations, along with automated one-click workflow construction. At its core, the system employs a hierarchical multi-agent framework comprising a central assistant agent for task delegation and specialized worker agents for different usages, supported by our curated ComfyUI knowledge bases to streamline debugging and deployment. We validate the effectiveness of ComfyUI-Copilot through both offline quantitative evaluations and online user feedback, showing that it accurately recommends nodes and accelerates workflow development. Additionally, use cases illustrate that ComfyUI-Copilot lowers entry barriers for beginners and enhances workflow efficiency for experienced users. The ComfyUI-Copilot installation package and a demo video are available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/ComfyUI-Copilot.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the summary.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500 demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle with low-resource languages due to limited training data. This paper presents TALL (Trainable Architecture for Enhancing LLM Performance in Low-Resource Languages), which integrates an LLM with two bilingual translation models. TALL transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive translation, and fine-tuning approaches. The architecture employs a parameter-efficient strategy, freezing pre-trained components while training only lightweight adapter modules, balancing computational efficiency with performance gains.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600 meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human level on this task.

<title>Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature, inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably) not accompanied by conscious experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift, ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations (qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM, enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle, context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b) fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues, our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at: https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/resources.html#SHINES .

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable, image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better capture the distinguishing features between different categories by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text. Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework, CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection effect.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4 multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked, and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in natural language text without any training data, is critical for document understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology, extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding. Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision. Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED framework.

<title>Information Locality as an Inductive Bias for Neural Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models (LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs) is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for future improvements.

<title>Do Large Language Models Judge Error Severity Like Humans?</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al. (2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings, evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour. Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao, replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly, DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge. Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2. Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

<title>ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or \textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets. Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our code is available under https://github.com/moXmiller/counterfactual-reasoning.git .

<title>RELIC: Evaluating Compositional Instruction Following via Language Recognition</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context. Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated, mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks, finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases, models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex instructions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books, encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially, we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2 7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for the Comma v0.1 models.

<title>Improving Low-Resource Morphological Inflection via Self-Supervised Objectives</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives. Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM. However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource morphological modeling.

<title>Towards a Unified System of Representation for Continuity and Discontinuity in Natural Language</title>

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal, Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic structure in these three grammar formalisms.

<title>CLATTER: Comprehensive Entailment Reasoning for Hallucination Detection</title>

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit ``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end, we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition, (ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

<title>Micro-Act: Mitigate Knowledge Conflict in Question Answering via Actionable Self-Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent, parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine, an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

<title>Constrained Entropic Unlearning: A Primal-Dual Framework for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information. Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However, analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn, fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around 12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources, revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however, the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/lmarena/search-arena.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human = -0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%, while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds, ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380 industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering, with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16% in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource decision making.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000 questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation, and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model, with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the voice reconstruction task.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses. While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.

<title>Behavioural vs. Representational Systematicity in End-to-End Models: An Opinionated Survey</title>

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization, as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn. However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of mechanistic interpretability.

<title>Understanding and Meeting Practitioner Needs When Measuring Representational Harms Caused by LLM-Based Systems</title>

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner needs.

<title>Towards Efficient Speech-Text Jointly Decoding within One Speech Language Model</title>

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2) Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels, and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the estimation accuracy.

<title>Clustering and Median Aggregation Improve Differentially Private Inference</title>

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example. Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar, allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However, the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing, regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection. Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However, Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs). Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9% respectively.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse retrieval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs), necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly, computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs, while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model, EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models, while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories, inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs, lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs, which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models' explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven, intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization, where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs mitigate this issue.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging. Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at 2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies. Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions: for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli. CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving human-level accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/NathanHerr/LLM-First-Search}{LLM-First-Search}.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information. This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques. Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context applications.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet, Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective, approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding. This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network itself.

<title>Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games</title>

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.

<title>Improving Data Efficiency for LLM Reinforcement Fine-tuning Through Difficulty-targeted Online Data Selection and Rollout Replay</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around 9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60 minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs, spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets, VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

<title>Kinetics: Rethinking Test-Time Scaling Laws</title>

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective, revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g., Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS, attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor. Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training, where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve through increased generation. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/Kinetics.

<title>Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

<title>Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails, making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex linguistic tasks has sparked debate about their capabilities. Unlike humans, these models learn language solely from textual data without directly interacting with the world. Yet they generate seemingly meaningful text on diverse topics. This achievement has renewed interest in the classical `Symbol Grounding Problem' -- the question of whether the internal representations and outputs of symbolic AI systems can possess intrinsic meaning that is not parasitic on external interpretation. Although modern LLMs compute over vectors rather than symbols, an analogous problem arises for these systems, which we call the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two main goals. First, we distinguish five main notions of grounding that are often conflated in the literature, and argue that only one of them, which we call referential grounding, is relevant to the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on philosophical theories of representational content, we provide two arguments for the claim that LLMs and related systems can achieve referential grounding: (1) through preference fine-tuning methods that explicitly establish world-involving functions, and (2) through pre-training alone, which in limited domains may select for internal states with world-involving content, as mechanistic interpretability research suggests. Through these pathways, LLMs can establish connections to the world sufficient for intrinsic meaning. One potentially surprising implication of our discussion is that that multimodality and embodiment are neither necessary nor sufficient to overcome the Grounding Problem.

<title>Bias in Language Models: Beyond Trick Tests and Toward RUTEd Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Standard benchmarks of bias and fairness in large language models (LLMs) measure the association between the user attributes stated or implied by a prompt and the LLM's short text response, but human-AI interaction increasingly requires long-form and context-specific system output to solve real-world tasks. In the commonly studied domain of gender-occupation bias, we test whether these benchmarks are robust to lengthening the LLM responses as a measure of Realistic Use and Tangible Effects (i.e., RUTEd evaluations). From the current literature, we adapt three standard bias metrics (neutrality, skew, and stereotype) and develop analogous RUTEd evaluations from three contexts of real-world use: children's bedtime stories, user personas, and English language learning exercises. We find that standard bias metrics have no significant correlation with the more realistic bias metrics. For example, selecting the least biased model based on the standard "trick tests" coincides with selecting the least biased model as measured in more realistic use no more than random chance. We suggest that there is not yet evidence to justify standard benchmarks as reliable proxies of real-world AI biases, and we encourage further development of evaluations grounded in particular contexts.

Abstract: Finetuning large language models with a variety of instruction-response pairs has enhanced their capability to understand and follow instructions. Current instruction tuning primarily relies on teacher models or human intervention to generate and refine the instructions and responses for training, which are costly, non-sustainable, and may lack diversity. In this paper, we introduce Mosaic Instruction Tuning (Mosaic-IT), a human/model-free compositional data synthesis method that can efficiently create rich and diverse augmentations from existing instruction tuning data to enhance the LLMs. Mosaic-IT randomly concatenates multiple instruction data into one and trains the model to produce the corresponding responses with predefined higher-level meta-instructions to strengthen its multi-step instruction-following and format-following skills. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a superior performance and training efficiency of Mosaic-IT, which achieves consistent performance improvements over various benchmarks and an 80% reduction in training costs compared with original instruction tuning. Our codes and data are available at https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Mosaic-IT.

Abstract: The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have documented a sort of "bias" in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.

Abstract: A plethora of sentence embedding models makes it challenging to choose one, especially for technical domains rich with specialized vocabulary. In this work, we domain adapt embeddings using telecom data for question answering. We evaluate embeddings obtained from publicly available models and their domain-adapted variants, on both point retrieval accuracies, as well as their (95%) confidence intervals. We establish a systematic method to obtain thresholds for similarity scores for different embeddings. As expected, we observe that fine-tuning improves mean bootstrapped accuracies. We also observe that it results in tighter confidence intervals, which further improve when pre-training is preceded by fine-tuning. We introduce metrics which measure the distributional overlaps of top-$K$, correct and random document similarities with the question. Further, we show that these metrics are correlated with retrieval accuracy and similarity thresholds. Recent literature shows conflicting effects of isotropy on retrieval accuracies. Our experiments establish that the isotropy of embeddings (as measured by two independent state-of-the-art isotropy metric definitions) is poorly correlated with retrieval performance. We show that embeddings for domain-specific sentences have little overlap with those for domain-agnostic ones, and fine-tuning moves them further apart. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for use of our methodology and metrics by researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceedingly well in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks for many languages including English. However, despite being the fifth most-spoken language globally, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in Bangla remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged for improving Bangla GEC. For that, we first do an extensive categorization of 12 error classes in Bangla, and take a survey of native Bangla speakers to collect real-world errors. We next devise a rule-based noise injection method to create grammatically incorrect sentences corresponding to correct ones. The Vaiyakarana dataset, thus created, consists of 5,67,422 sentences of which 2,27,119 are erroneous. This dataset is then used to instruction-tune LLMs for the task of GEC in Bangla. Evaluations show that instruction-tuning with \name improves GEC performance of LLMs by 3-7 percentage points as compared to the zero-shot setting, and makes them achieve human-like performance in grammatical error identification. Humans, though, remain superior in error correction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama3 have significantly impacted various fields by enabling high-quality synthetic data generation and reducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this, challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper presents DataGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. DataGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity, DataGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints, enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data generated by DataGen, and each module within DataGen plays a critical role in this enhancement. Additionally, DataGen is applied in two practical scenarios: benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that DataGen effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking and that data augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.

Abstract: In-group language is an important signifier of group dynamics. This paper proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.

Abstract: There is a growing need for pluralistic alignment methods that can steer language models towards individual attributes and preferences. One such method, Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI), uses conditional mutual information to encourage the connection between behavioral preferences and model responses. We conduct two experiments exploring SAMI in multi-task settings. First, we compare SAMI to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a multi-task benchmark (MT-Bench), using a stronger model to generate training data for a weaker one across diverse categories (humanities, STEM, extraction, coding, math, reasoning, and roleplay). Our results indicate that one iteration of SAMI has a 57% win rate against DPO, with significant variation in performance between task categories. Second, we examine SAMI's impact on mathematical accuracy (GSM-8K) relative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While SAMI increases zero-shot performance by 1.1%, SFT is more effective with a 3.2% boost. However, SAMI shows interesting scaling trends. When given 10 attempts, SAMI improves accuracy by 3.9%, while SFT achieves a 10.1% increase. Combining SAMI with SFT yields an additional improvement of 1.3% in multi-attempt settings, though single-attempt accuracy remains unchanged.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in visual and language reasoning tasks, they invariably generate flawed responses. Self-correction that instructs models to refine their outputs presents a promising solution to this issue. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on Large Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs, particularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely unexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs during both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated self-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without relying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we collect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial and refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs during the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs struggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without additional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their performance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when their self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and disfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a refinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models through additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses directly without further refinement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for knowledge tracing (KT) due to their strong reasoning and generalization abilities. While recent LLM-based KT methods have proposed new prompt formats, they struggle to represent the full interaction histories of example learners within a single prompt during in-context learning (ICL), resulting in limited scalability and high computational cost under token constraints. In this work, we present \textit{LLM-based Option-weighted Knowledge Tracing (LOKT)}, a simple yet effective framework that encodes the interaction histories of example learners in context as \textit{textual categorical option weights (TCOW)}. TCOW are semantic labels (e.g., ``inadequate'') assigned to the options selected by learners when answering questions, enhancing the interpretability of LLMs. Experiments on multiple-choice datasets show that LOKT outperforms existing non-LLM and LLM-based KT models in both cold-start and warm-start settings. Moreover, LOKT enables scalable and cost-efficient inference, achieving strong performance even under strict token constraints.

Abstract: As language technologies become widespread, it is important to understand how changes in language affect reader perceptions and behaviors. These relationships may be formalized as the isolated causal effect of some focal language-encoded intervention (e.g., factual inaccuracies) on an external outcome (e.g., readers' beliefs). In this paper, we introduce a formal estimation framework for isolated causal effects of language. We show that a core challenge of estimating isolated effects is the need to approximate all non-focal language outside of the intervention. Drawing on the principle of omitted variable bias, we provide measures for evaluating the quality of both non-focal language approximations and isolated effect estimates themselves. We find that poor approximation of non-focal language can lead to bias in the corresponding isolated effect estimates due to omission of relevant variables, and we show how to assess the sensitivity of effect estimates to such bias along the two key axes of fidelity and overlap. In experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world data, we validate the ability of our framework to correctly recover isolated effects and demonstrate the utility of our proposed measures.

Abstract: What makes a difference in the post-training of LLMs? We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent. Our code, data, and gradient statistics can be found in: https://github.com/MingLiiii/Layer_Gradient.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding has gained popularity as an effective technique for accelerating the auto-regressive inference process of Large Language Models. However, Speculative Decoding entirely relies on the availability of efficient draft models, which are often lacking for many existing language models due to a stringent constraint of vocabulary compatibility. In this work we introduce FastDraft, a novel and efficient approach for pre-training and aligning a draft model to any large language model by incorporating efficient pre-training, followed by fine-tuning over synthetic datasets generated by the target model. We demonstrate FastDraft by training two highly parameter efficient drafts for the popular Phi-3-mini and Llama-3.1-8B models. Using FastDraft, we were able to produce a draft model with approximately 10 billion tokens on a single server with 8 Intel$^\circledR$ Gaudi$^\circledR$ 2 accelerators in under 24 hours. Our results show that the draft model achieves impressive results in key metrics of acceptance rate, block efficiency and up to 3x memory bound speed up when evaluated on code completion and up to 2x in summarization, text completion and instruction tasks. We validate our theoretical findings through benchmarking on the latest Intel$^\circledR$ Core$^{\tiny \text{TM}}$ Ultra, achieving a wall-clock time speedup of up to 2x, indicating a significant reduction in runtime. Due to its high quality, FastDraft unlocks large language models inference on AI-PC and other edge-devices.

Abstract: In this work, we explore a cost-effective framework for multilingual image generation. We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiple languages.Based on this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching those in English (39.57 for English vs. 39.61 for other languages); and (3) Broad applicability. Seamlessly integrating with compatible community tools like LoRA, LCM, ControlNet, and IP-Adapter, expanding its potential use cases.

Abstract: The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performances in recent years, setting a new paradigm for NLP research and industry. The legal domain has received some attention from the NLP community partly due to its textual nature. Some tasks from this domain are represented by question-answering (QA) tasks. This work explores the legal domain Multiple-Choice QA (MCQA) for a low-resource language. The contribution of this work is multi-fold. We first introduce JuRO, the first openly available Romanian legal MCQA dataset, comprising three different examinations and a number of 10,836 total questions. Along with this dataset, we introduce CROL, an organized corpus of laws that has a total of 93 distinct documents with their modifications from 763 time spans, that we leveraged in this work for Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. Moreover, we are the first to propose Law-RoG, a Knowledge Graph (KG) for the Romanian language, and this KG is derived from the aforementioned corpus. Lastly, we propose a novel approach for MCQA, Graph Retrieval Augmented by Facts (GRAF), which achieves competitive results with generally accepted SOTA methods and even exceeds them in most settings.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) emerge as a promising approach for process supervision in mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs), which aim to identify and mitigate intermediate errors in the reasoning processes. However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges, particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation methods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN Optimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines response-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN evaluation and the step-wise error identification task. Finally, we release a new state-of-the-art PRM that outperforms existing open-source alternatives and provides practical guidelines for future research in building process supervision models.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a cornerstone in many critical sectors, including healthcare, finance, and customer relationship management. This is especially true with the development and use of advanced models such as GPT-based architectures and BERT, which are widely used in decision-making processes. However, the black-box nature of these advanced NLP models has created an urgent need for transparency and explainability. This review explores explainable NLP (XNLP) with a focus on its practical deployment and real-world applications, examining its implementation and the challenges faced in domain-specific contexts. The paper underscores the importance of explainability in NLP and provides a comprehensive perspective on how XNLP can be designed to meet the unique demands of various sectors, from healthcare's need for clear insights to finance's emphasis on fraud detection and risk assessment. Additionally, this review aims to bridge the knowledge gap in XNLP literature by offering a domain-specific exploration and discussing underrepresented areas such as real-world applicability, metric evaluation, and the role of human interaction in model assessment. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions that could enhance the understanding and broader application of XNLP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable proficiency in natural language tasks, yet their frequent overconfidence-misalignment between predicted confidence and true correctness-poses significant risks in critical decision-making applications. We present a comprehensive analysis on calibration in LLMs across nine LLMs and three factual Question-Answering (QA) datasets, systematically comparing standard free-generation settings against structured distractor-augmented prompts. Our evaluation reveals that explicitly incorporating distractors can substantially mitigate miscalibration, achieving relative accuracy improvements up to 460% and ECE reductions up to 90%. Despite general trends, we uncover nuanced findings: large RLHF-tuned models display inherent calibration strengths but can paradoxically suffer increased miscalibration on easier queries, whereas smaller models benefit disproportionately from distractor prompts but remain significantly miscalibrated. Through detailed analyses across question types, we identify persistent calibration failures, particularly in person-based queries. We conclude with concrete recommendations-targeted fine-tuning, structured prompting, and strategic model choice-to ensure reliable, trustworthy LLM deployments.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models are largely driven by scaling both model size and data, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks, including speech recognition. Traditionally, ASR models are evaluated using metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), which depend on ground truth labels. As a result of limited labeled data from diverse domains and testing conditions, the true generalization capabilities of these models beyond standard benchmarks remain unclear. Moreover, labeling data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this, we propose a novel label-free approach for approximating ASR performance metrics, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. Our method utilizes multimodal embeddings in a unified space for speech and transcription representations, combined with a high-quality proxy model to compute proxy metrics. These features are used to train a regression model to predict key ASR metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER). We experiment with over 40 models across 14 datasets representing both standard and in-the-wild testing conditions. Our results show that we approximate the metrics within a single-digit absolute difference across all experimental configurations, outperforming the most recent baseline by more than 50\%.

Abstract: Speech foundation models trained at a massive scale, both in terms of model and data size, result in robust systems capable of performing multiple speech tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR). These models transcend language and domain barriers, yet effectively measuring their performance remains a challenge. Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but often fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly when detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is especially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and aviation, where errors can have severe consequences. In our work, we address this gap by investigating hallucination in ASR models. We examine how factors such as distribution shifts, model size, and model architecture influence the hallucination error rate (HER), a metric we introduce to quantify hallucinations. Our analysis of over 20 ASR models reveals \numinsights~key insights: (1) High WERs can mask low hallucination rates, while low WERs may conceal dangerous hallucinations. (2) Synthetic noise, both adversarial and common perturbations like white noise, pitch shift, and time stretching, increase HER. (3) Distribution shift correlates strongly with HER ($\alpha = 0.91$). Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating HER alongside traditional metrics like WER to better assess ASR model performance, particularly in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: An increasingly common socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound ``too good to be true'', where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how \abr{ai} can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in \textit{Diplomacy}, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents' value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-\abr{ai} interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering \textit{friction} to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals.

Abstract: A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various areas, such as text generation and code synthesis. However, the reliability of performance evaluation has come under scrutiny due to data contamination-the unintended overlap between training and test datasets. This overlap has the potential to artificially inflate model performance, as LLMs are typically trained on extensive datasets scraped from publicly available sources. These datasets often inadvertently overlap with the benchmarks used for evaluation, leading to an overestimation of the models' true generalization capabilities. In this paper, we first examine the definition and impacts of data contamination. Secondly, we review methods for contamination-free evaluation, focusing on three strategies: data updating-based methods, data rewriting-based methods, and prevention-based methods. Specifically, we highlight dynamic benchmarks and LLM-driven evaluation methods. Finally, we categorize contamination detecting methods based on model information dependency: white-Box, gray-Box, and black-Box detection approaches. Our survey highlights the requirements for more rigorous evaluation protocols and proposes future directions for addressing data contamination challenges.

Abstract: Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental, social and governance, ESG performance, but their content is increasingly obscured by greenwashing - sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Yet, existing NLP approaches for ESG analysis lack robustness against greenwashing risks, often extracting insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce A3CG - Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key directions for future research.

Abstract: Event Detection (ED) -- the task of identifying event mentions from natural language text -- is critical for enabling reasoning in highly specialized domains such as biomedicine, law, and epidemiology. Data generation has proven to be effective in broadening its utility to wider applications without requiring expensive expert annotations. However, when existing generation approaches are applied to specialized domains, they struggle with label noise, where annotations are incorrect, and domain drift, characterized by a distributional mismatch between generated sentences and the target domain. To address these issues, we introduce SNaRe, a domain-aware synthetic data generation framework composed of three components: Scout, Narrator, and Refiner. Scout extracts triggers from unlabeled target domain data and curates a high-quality domain-specific trigger list using corpus-level statistics to mitigate domain drift. Narrator, conditioned on these triggers, generates high-quality domain-aligned sentences, and Refiner identifies additional event mentions, ensuring high annotation quality. Experimentation on three diverse domain ED datasets reveals how SNaRe outperforms the best baseline, achieving average F1 gains of 3-7% in the zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% F1 improvement for multilingual generation. Analyzing the generated trigger hit rate and human evaluation substantiates SNaRe's stronger annotation quality and reduced domain drift.

Abstract: Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, including Argument Summarization (ArgSum), a key subfield of Argument Mining (AM). This paper investigates the integration of state-of-the-art LLMs into ArgSum, including for its evaluation. In particular, we propose a novel prompt-based evaluation scheme, and validate it through a novel human benchmark dataset. Our work makes three main contributions: (i) the integration of LLMs into existing ArgSum frameworks, (ii) the development of a new LLM-based ArgSum system, benchmarked against prior methods, and (iii) the introduction of an advanced LLM-based evaluation scheme. We demonstrate that the use of LLMs substantially improves both the generation and evaluation of argument summaries, achieving state-of-the-art results and advancing the field of ArgSum. We also show that among the four LLMs integrated in (i) and (ii), Qwen-3-32B, despite having the fewest parameters, performs best, even surpassing GPT-4o, while LLaMA-3.3-70B consistently underperforms.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across multi-domain tasks. Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents. ATLaS maintains and improves base LLM skills as generalist agents interacting with diverse environments.

Abstract: Online misinformation remains a critical challenge, and fact-checkers increasingly rely on claim matching systems that use sentence embedding models to retrieve relevant fact-checks. However, as users interact with claims online, they often introduce edits, and it remains unclear whether current embedding models used in retrieval are robust to such edits. To investigate this, we introduce a perturbation framework that generates valid and natural claim variations, enabling us to assess the robustness of a wide-range of sentence embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline and evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation approaches. Our evaluation reveals that standard embedding models exhibit notable performance drops on edited claims, while LLM-distilled embedding models offer improved robustness at a higher computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps to reduce the performance drop, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. To address these retrieval gaps, we evaluate train- and inference-time mitigation approaches, demonstrating that they can improve in-domain robustness by up to 17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage points. Overall, our findings provide practical improvements to claim-matching systems, enabling more reliable fact-checking of evolving misinformation.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a prominent method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO has enabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference alignment is hampered by data scarcity. To address this, we propose a novel approach that $\textit{captures}$ learned preferences from well-aligned English models by implicit rewards and $\textit{transfers}$ them to other languages through iterative training. Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model from the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference model. This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to evaluate multilingual responses. The annotated data is subsequently used for multilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from English to other languages. Fine-tuning Llama3 for two iterations resulted in a 12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control Win Rate across all training languages on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging existing English-aligned models can enable efficient and effective multilingual preference alignment, significantly reducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data.

Abstract: We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the largest manually annotated Hindi-English code-mixed dataset, comprising 125K+ high-quality instances across five core NLP tasks: Matrix Language Identification, Token-level Language Identification, POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Machine Translation. Each instance is annotated by three bilingual annotators, yielding over 376K expert annotations with strong inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' Kappa $\geq$ 0.81). The rigorously preprocessed and filtered dataset covers both Devanagari and Roman scripts and spans diverse domains, ensuring real-world linguistic coverage. Evaluation reveals that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform traditional tools and open-source models. Notably, one-shot prompting consistently boosts performance across tasks, especially in structure-sensitive predictions like POS and NER, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt-based adaptation in code-mixed, low-resource settings. COMI-LINGUA is publicly available at: https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/CodeMixing_Project.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment in high-stake domains requires consistent and coherent behavior across multiple rounds of user interaction. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving LLM response consistency, making three key contributions. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/yubol-bobo/MT-Consistency. First, we introduce Position-Weighted Consistency (PWC), a metric designed to capture both the importance of early-stage stability and recovery patterns in multi-turn interactions. Second, we present MT-Consistency, a carefully curated benchmark dataset spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels, specifically designed to evaluate LLM consistency under various challenging follow-up scenarios. Third, we introduce Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), a framework that significantly improves response stability by explicitly integrating internal model confidence scores during the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARG significantly improves response stability without sacrificing accuracy, offering a practical path toward more dependable LLM behavior in critical, real-world deployments.

Abstract: Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) present significant challenges in natural language processing due to their limited linguistic resources and underrepresentation in standard datasets. While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation have substantially improved translation capabilities for high-resource languages, performance disparities persist for LRLs, particularly impacting privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained scenarios. This paper systematically evaluates current LLMs in 200 languages using the FLORES-200 benchmark and demonstrates their limitations in LRL translation capability. We also explore alternative data sources, including news articles and bilingual dictionaries, and demonstrate how knowledge distillation from large pre-trained teacher models can significantly improve the performance of small LLMs on LRL translation tasks. For example, this approach increases EN->LB with the LLM-as-a-Judge score on the validation set from 0.36 to 0.89 for Llama-3.2-3B. Furthermore, we examine different fine-tuning configurations, providing practical insights on optimal data scale, training efficiency, and the preservation of generalization capabilities of models under study.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM} (\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety \textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a 16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&amp;effective score compared to GPT-4V.

<title>Calibrating Translation Decoding with Quality Estimation on LLMs</title>

Abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method, translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code and human evaluation data, has been released to the community: https://github.com/moore3930/calibrating-llm-mt.

Abstract: In this technical report, we empirically investigate the relationship between linguistic fluency and domain knowledge in the context of continual learning with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we enhance the linguistic fluency of the Gemma2 LLM for the Lithuanian language by autoregressively pretraining its full parameter set on the first 10\% of the Lithuanian language component of the CulturaX dataset. To prevent catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing domain knowledge, we apply Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), leveraging Fisher information estimated using data from the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. In the post-training evaluations, we assess linguistic fluency through perplexity and evaluate domain knowledge using accuracy on a suite of language understanding benchmarks, including ARC-Easy, Belebele, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande, in both English and Lithuanian. The empirical results demonstrate that EWC not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting by preserving the model's performance in terms of both linguistic fluency and domain knowledge but also improves or maintains these capabilities for the newly added Lithuanian language. These findings highlight the potential for more efficient adaptation of general-purpose LLMs to under-represented languages without requiring access to the original training data. The accompanying codebase is openly accessible at https://github.com/Neurotechnology/LLM_EWC.

Abstract: We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming even much larger 32B models. The final RL-tuned model, MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance on mathematics, code and general reasoning tasks, surpassing the performance of OpenAI o1-mini. The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/xiaomimimo/MiMo.

Abstract: Understanding which neural components drive specific capabilities in mid-sized language models ($\leq$10B parameters) remains a key challenge. We introduce the $(\bm{K}, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC), a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B, we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many "weak" heads, arithmetic and word problems share more consistently critical "strong" heads. Importantly, we find that each task maintains dedicated "super-heads" with minimal cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational, and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs. These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in real-world contexts.

<title>Distilling the Implicit Multi-Branch Structure in LLMs' Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

<title>When can isotropy help adapt LLMs' next word prediction to numerical domains?</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0 demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of 66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1 to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information infrastructures.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.

Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance. While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored. We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example selection.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms.

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy and efficiency in training-free scenarios. Our code and data can be seen at https://github.com/IDEA-XL/RAPM.

Abstract: With approximately 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, current large language models (LLMs) support only a small subset. Prior research indicates LLMs can learn new languages for certain tasks without supervised data. We extend this investigation to speech recognition, investigating whether LLMs can learn unseen, low-resource languages through in-context learning (ICL). With experiments on four diverse endangered languages that LLMs have not been trained on, we find that providing more relevant text samples enhances performance in both language modelling and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. Furthermore, we show that the probability-based approach outperforms the traditional instruction-based approach in language learning. Lastly, we show ICL enables LLMs to achieve ASR performance that is comparable to or even surpasses dedicated language models trained specifically for these languages, while preserving the original capabilities of the LLMs.

Abstract: A hallmark of human innovation is the process of recombination -- creating original ideas by integrating elements of existing mechanisms and concepts. In this work, we automatically mine the scientific literature and build CHIMERA: a large-scale knowledge base (KB) of recombination examples. CHIMERA can be used to empirically explore at scale how scientists recombine concepts and take inspiration from different areas, or to train supervised machine learning models that learn to predict new creative cross-domain directions. To build this KB, we present a novel information extraction task of extracting recombination from scientific paper abstracts, collect a high-quality corpus of hundreds of manually annotated abstracts, and use it to train an LLM-based extraction model. The model is applied to a large corpus of papers in the AI domain, yielding a KB of over 28K recombination examples. We analyze CHIMERA to explore the properties of recombination in different subareas of AI. Finally, we train a scientific hypothesis generation model using the KB, which predicts new recombination directions that real-world researchers find inspiring.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is available at https://github.com/bolixinyu/DynamicGroupAttention.

Abstract: Social media platforms have experienced a significant rise in toxic content, including abusive language and discriminatory remarks, presenting growing challenges for content moderation. Some users evade censorship by deliberately disguising toxic words through homophonic cloak, which necessitates the task of unveiling cloaked toxicity. Existing methods are mostly designed for English texts, while Chinese cloaked toxicity unveiling has not been solved yet. To tackle the issue, we propose C$^2$TU, a novel training-free and prompt-free method for Chinese cloaked toxic content unveiling. It first employs substring matching to identify candidate toxic words based on Chinese homo-graph and toxic lexicon. Then it filters those candidates that are non-toxic and corrects cloaks to be their corresponding toxicities. Specifically, we develop two model variants for filtering, which are based on BERT and LLMs, respectively. For LLMs, we address the auto-regressive limitation in computing word occurrence probability and utilize the full semantic contexts of a text sequence to reveal cloaked toxic words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^2$TU can achieve superior performance on two Chinese toxic datasets. In particular, our method outperforms the best competitor by up to 71% on the F1 score and 35% on accuracy, respectively. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/XDxc-cuber/C2TU-Chinese-cloaked-toxicity-unveiling.

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness (perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit increasingly human-like capabilities, aligning them with human values has become critically important. Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement learning, are being deployed to better align LLMs with human values. However, while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness, they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over 10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods. Further analysis reveals that performance enhances as additional user interaction history becomes available, indicating the model's ability to refine its persona simulation capabilities over time.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3) reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

Abstract: Increasing model size has unlocked a dazzling array of capabilities in modern language models. At the same time, even frontier models remain vulnerable to jailbreaks and prompt injections, despite concerted efforts to make them robust. As both attack and defense gain access to more compute, and as models become larger, what happens to robustness? We argue that to answer this question requires a \emph{scaling} approach, which we employ in an extensive study of language model robustness across several classification tasks, model families, and adversarial attacks. We find that in the absence of explicit safety training, larger models are not consistently more robust; however, scale improves sample efficiency in adversarial training, though it worsens compute efficiency. Further, we find that increasing attack compute smoothly improves attack success rate against both undefended and adversarially trained models. Finally, after exploring robustness transfer across attacks and threat models, we combine attack and defense scaling rates to study the offense-defense balance. We find that while attack scaling outpaces adversarial training across all models studied, larger adversarially trained models might give defense the advantage in the long run. These results underscore the utility of the scaling lens, and provide a paradigm for evaluating future attacks and defenses on frontier models.

Abstract: Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs), such models often leverage spurious or biased features learnt from their training data and can become misaligned, leading to undesired behaviours. While existing techniques can steer model behaviour at inference-time, they are often post-hoc and do not embed steering as an intrinsic model feature. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that FIT: (i) successfully steers behaviour at inference time; (ii) increases robustness by amplifying core task signals and down-weighting spurious cues; (iii) mitigates social bias by suppressing demographic attributes; and (iv) generalises under distribution shifts and to previously unseen focus features. FIT therefore offers a lightweight, intrinsic mechanism for building more robust, fair, and easily controllable LLMs.

<title>Failure Modes of LLMs for Causal Reasoning on Narratives</title>

arXiv:2410.23884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events (i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: The proliferation of disinformation demands reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. We present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME operates in a six-stage process, dynamically selecting the tools and search depth to extract and evaluate textual and visual evidence. Unlike prior approaches that are text-only, lack explainability, or rely solely on parametric knowledge, DEFAME performs end-to-end verification, accounting for images in claims and evidence while generating structured, multimodal reports. Evaluation on the popular benchmarks VERITE, AVerITeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all previous methods, establishing itself as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking system for uni- and multimodal fact-checking. Moreover, we introduce a new multimodal benchmark, ClaimReview2024+, featuring claims after the knowledge cutoff of GPT-4o, avoiding data leakage. Here, DEFAME drastically outperforms the GPT-4o baselines, showing temporal generalizability and the potential for real-time fact-checking.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

Abstract: Intermediate Representations (IRs) play a critical role in compiler design and program analysis, yet their comprehension by Large Language Models (LLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we present an explorative empirical study evaluating the capabilities of six state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3, DeepSeek, Gemma 2, Llama 3, and Code Llama, in understanding IRs. Specifically, we assess model performance across four core tasks: control flow graph reconstruction, decompilation, code summarization, and execution reasoning. While LLMs exhibit competence in parsing IR syntax and identifying high-level structures, they consistently struggle with instruction-level reasoning, especially in control flow reasoning, loop handling, and dynamic execution. Common failure modes include misinterpreting branching instructions, omitting critical operations, and relying on heuristic reasoning rather than precise instruction-level logic. Our findings highlight the need for IR-specific enhancements in LLM design. We recommend fine-tuning on structured IR datasets and integrating control-flow-sensitive architectures to improve model effectiveness. All experimental data and source code are publicly available at

Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 24 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9\% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a crucial method for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), with its effectiveness influenced by two key factors: rank selection and weight initialization. While numerous LoRA variants have been proposed to improve performance by addressing one of these aspects, they often compromise usability or computational efficiency. In this paper, we analyze and identify the core limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel framework -- GoRA (Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation) -- that simultaneously adapts both the rank and initialization strategy within a unified framework. GoRA leverages gradient information during training to dynamically assign optimal ranks and initialize low-rank adapter weights in an adaptive manner. To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only addresses the limitations of prior approaches -- which often focus on either rank selection or initialization in isolation -- but also unifies both aspects within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation. Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the efficiency of vanilla LoRA. For example, when fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Base for mathematical reasoning, GoRA achieves a 5.13-point improvement over standard LoRA and even outperforms full fine-tuning by 2.05 points under high-rank settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often struggle to recognize novel concepts, as they rely on pre-trained knowledge and have limited ability to capture subtle visual details. Domain-specific knowledge gaps in training also make them prone to confusing visually similar, commonly misrepresented, or low-resource concepts. To help LMMs better align nuanced visual features with language, improving their ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts, we propose a Contrastive visual Data Augmentation (CoDA) strategy. CoDA extracts key contrastive textual and visual features of target concepts against the known concepts they are misrecognized as, and then uses multimodal generative models to produce targeted synthetic data. Automatic filtering of extracted features and augmented images is implemented to guarantee their quality, as verified by human annotators. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDA on low-resource concept and diverse scene recognition datasets including INaturalist and SUN. We additionally collect NovelSpecies, a benchmark dataset consisting of newly discovered animal species that are guaranteed to be unseen by LMMs. LLaVA-1.6 1-shot updating results on these three datasets show CoDA significantly improves SOTA visual data augmentation strategies by 12.3% (NovelSpecies), 5.1% (SUN), and 6.0% (iNat) absolute gains in accuracy.

Abstract: Jailbreaking large-language models (LLMs) involves testing their robustness against adversarial prompts and evaluating their ability to withstand prompt attacks that could elicit unauthorized or malicious responses. In this paper, we present TurboFuzzLLM, a mutation-based fuzzing technique for efficiently finding a collection of effective jailbreaking templates that, when combined with harmful questions, can lead a target LLM to produce harmful responses through black-box access via user prompts. We describe the limitations of directly applying existing template-based attacking techniques in practice, and present functional and efficiency-focused upgrades we added to mutation-based fuzzing to generate effective jailbreaking templates automatically. TurboFuzzLLM achieves $\geq$ 95\% attack success rates (ASR) on public datasets for leading LLMs (including GPT-4o \& GPT-4 Turbo), shows impressive generalizability to unseen harmful questions, and helps in improving model defenses to prompt attacks. TurboFuzzLLM is available open source at https://github.com/amazon-science/TurboFuzzLLM.

Abstract: Cognitive health in older adults presents a growing challenge. Although conversational interventions show feasibility in improving cognitive wellness, human caregiver resources remain overloaded. AI-based chatbots have shown promise, yet existing work is often limited to implicit strategies or heavily depends on training and label resources. In response, we propose a strategy-guided AI chatbot named ChatWise that follows a dual-level conversation reasoning framework. It integrates macro-level strategy planning and micro-level utterance generation to enable engaging, multi-turn dialogue tailored to older adults. Empirical results show that ChatWise closely aligns with professional human caregiver behaviors in offline evaluation using real clinic data, and achieves positive user cognitive and emotional responses in interactive simulations with digital twins, which significantly outperforms AI baselines that follow implicit conversation generation.

Abstract: Accurate and verifiable large language model (LLM) simulations of human research subjects promise an accessible data source for understanding human behavior and training new AI systems. However, results to date have been limited, and few social scientists have adopted this method. In this position paper, we argue that the promise of LLM social simulations can be achieved by addressing five tractable challenges. We ground our argument in a review of empirical comparisons between LLMs and human research subjects, commentaries on the topic, and related work. We identify promising directions, including context-rich prompting and fine-tuning with social science datasets. We believe that LLM social simulations can already be used for pilot and exploratory studies, and more widespread use may soon be possible with rapidly advancing LLM capabilities. Researchers should prioritize developing conceptual models and iterative evaluations to make the best use of new AI systems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation through LLM-powered GUI agents, yet their ability to process sensitive data with limited human oversight raises significant privacy and security risks. This position paper identifies three key risks of GUI agents and examines how they differ from traditional GUI automation and general autonomous agents. Despite these risks, existing evaluations focus primarily on performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI agent design and evaluation.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.

<title>SUS backprop: linear backpropagation algorithm for long inputs in transformers</title>

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of backpropagation computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts back-propagation through most attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical transformer model, cutting about $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing $c \sim 25-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about $1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when training a transformer model on long sequences.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

<title>FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

Abstract: System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined directives that guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user inputs in text processing and generation. LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex, they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end, we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly approaching and potentially surpassing human-level performance, it has become imperative to develop approaches capable of effectively supervising and enhancing these powerful models using smaller, human-level models exposed to only human-level data. We address this critical weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization challenge by proposing a novel method aimed at improving weak experts, by training on the same limited human-level data, enabling them to generalize to complex, super-human-level tasks. Our approach, called \textbf{EnsemW2S}, employs a token-level ensemble strategy that iteratively combines multiple weak experts, systematically addressing the shortcomings identified in preceding iterations. By continuously refining these weak models, we significantly enhance their collective ability to supervise stronger student models. We extensively evaluate the generalization performance of both the ensemble of weak experts and the subsequent strong student model across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. For OOD, we specifically introduce question difficulty as an additional dimension for defining distributional shifts. Our empirical results demonstrate notable improvements, achieving 4\%, and 3.2\% improvements on ID datasets and, upto 6\% and 2.28\% on OOD datasets for experts and student models respectively, underscoring the effectiveness of our proposed method in advancing W2S generalization.

<title>Evaluation of LLMs in Speech is Often Flawed: Test Set Contamination in Large Language Models for Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve performance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure contamination impact, LLMs trained with/without contamination are compared. A contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Then, speech recognisers based on LLMs are compared. They show only subtle error rate differences if the LLM is contaminated, but assign significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during LLM training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.

<title>WikiGap: Promoting Epistemic Equity by Surfacing Knowledge Gaps Between English Wikipedia and other Language Editions</title>

Abstract: With more than 11 times as many pageviews as the next, English Wikipedia dominates global knowledge access relative to other language editions. Readers are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions, leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English. Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface. Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia. WikiGap thus paves the way for improved epistemic equity across language editions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers. Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Abstract: Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models remains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that first imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based "thinking" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning dataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group Relative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces LayerIF, a data-driven framework using Influence Functions to assess the training quality of individual layers in Large Language Models. By analyzing each layer's gradients and their impact on validation loss, LayerIF provides task-specific layer importance scores, revealing layer specialization for different tasks. These scores are used for expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experimental results with various LLM architectures show that the influence-guided allocation improves task performance consistently. <div>
arXiv:2505.23811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance. It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.

The article discusses the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating Knowledge Engineering (KE) tasks, focusing on the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). It highlights the lack of standardization in evaluating CQ generation tools, which hinders methodological rigor and result replication. To address this gap, the authors introduce Bench4KE, an API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. The system evaluates tools generating CQs using similarity metrics against a gold standard dataset from real-world ontology projects. The article provides a comparative analysis of four recent CQ generation systems based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Additionally, Bench4KE is designed to accommodate various KE automation tasks beyond CQ generation, such as SPARQL query generation and ontology testing.

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation, a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

Summary:
SAEBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation suite for sparse autoencoders (SAEs), measuring performance across eight diverse metrics including interpretability, feature disentanglement, and practical applications like unlearning. The evaluation includes over 200 open-source SAEs across eight architectures and training algorithms, revealing that gains on proxy metrics may not always translate to better practical performance. Matryoshka SAEs, despite slightly underperforming on existing proxy metrics, showed substantial performance advantages on feature disentanglement metrics, especially as SAE scale increased. The standardized evaluation framework provided by SAEBench allows for systematic comparison of SAE development, enabling researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies.

However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across eight diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at: www.neuronpedia.org/sae-bench

<br />
Summary: <br />
This study evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in automating disease annotation of CT radiology reports. It compares a rule-based algorithm, RadBERT, and three lightweight open-weight LLMs for labeling chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) CT reports. The study analyzed 40,833 CT reports from 29,540 patients, with 1,789 CAP reports manually annotated. Llama-3.1 8B and Gemma-3 27B showed the highest agreement, with Gemma-3 27B achieving the top macro-F1 score. Lightweight LLMs outperformed rule-based methods, especially for lung atelectasis annotation. However, binary labels alone may not capture the full nuance of report language. LLMs offer a flexible and efficient solution aligned with clinical judgment and user needs. <div>

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in automating disease annotation of CT radiology reports. We compare a rule-based algorithm (RBA), RadBERT, and three lightweight open-weight LLMs for multi-disease labeling of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) CT reports.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 40,833 CT reports from 29,540 patients, with 1,789 CAP reports manually annotated across three organ systems. External validation was conducted using the CT-RATE dataset. Three open-weight LLMs were tested with zero-shot prompting. Performance was evaluated using Cohen's Kappa and micro/macro-averaged F1 scores.
  Results: In 12,197 Duke CAP reports from 8,854 patients, Llama-3.1 8B and Gemma-3 27B showed the highest agreement ($\kappa$ median: 0.87). On the manually annotated set, Gemma-3 27B achieved the top macro-F1 (0.82), followed by Llama-3.1 8B (0.79), while the RBA scored lowest (0.64). On the CT-RATE dataset (lungs/pleura only), Llama-3.1 8B performed best (0.91), with Gemma-3 27B close behind (0.89). Performance differences were mainly due to differing labeling practices, especially for lung atelectasis.
  Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs outperform rule-based methods for CT report annotation and generalize across organ systems with zero-shot prompting. However, binary labels alone cannot capture the full nuance of report language. LLMs can provide a flexible, efficient solution aligned with clinical judgment and user needs.

<div> FailureSensorIQ, Multi-Choice Question-Answering Benchmark, Large Language Models, Industry 4.0, Reasoning

Summary:
FailureSensorIQ is a novel MCQA benchmarking system that evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason in complex Industry 4.0 scenarios. Unlike traditional benchmarks, it focuses on reasoning through failure modes and sensor data in industrial assets. The system assesses the Industrial knowledge of over a dozen LLMs and reveals a significant drop in performance under perturbations and distractions. A real-world case study demonstrates how LLMs can drive modeling decisions for failure prediction. The benchmark includes expert-curated MCQA for industrial assets, a leaderboard, and an LLM-based feature selection pipeline. The software is available on GitHub for research and development purposes.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce FailureSensorIQ, a novel Multi-Choice Question-Answering (MCQA) benchmarking system designed to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason and understand complex, domain-specific scenarios in Industry 4.0. Unlike traditional QA benchmarks, our system focuses on multiple aspects of reasoning through failure modes, sensor data, and the relationships between them across various industrial assets. Through this work, we envision a paradigm shift where modeling decisions are not only data-driven using statistical tools like correlation analysis and significance tests, but also domain-driven by specialized LLMs which can reason about the key contributors and useful patterns that can be captured with feature engineering. We evaluate the Industrial knowledge of over a dozen LLMs-including GPT-4, Llama, and Mistral-on FailureSensorIQ from different lens using Perturbation-Uncertainty-Complexity analysis, Expert Evaluation study, Asset-Specific Knowledge Gap analysis, ReAct agent using external knowledge-bases. Even though closed-source models with strong reasoning capabilities approach expert-level performance, the comprehensive benchmark reveals a significant drop in performance that is fragile to perturbations, distractions, and inherent knowledge gaps in the models. We also provide a real-world case study of how LLMs can drive the modeling decisions on 3 different failure prediction datasets related to various assets. We release: (a) expert-curated MCQA for various industrial assets, (b) FailureSensorIQ benchmark and Hugging Face leaderboard based on MCQA built from non-textual data found in ISO documents, and (c) LLMFeatureSelector, an LLM-based feature selection scikit-learn pipeline.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: language models, steering, hypernetwork, unsupervised learning, supervised learning

Summary:
HyperSteer introduces a family of hypernetwork-based architectures designed to generate steering vectors for language models. These vectors are conditioned on both natural language steering prompts and the internals of the steered language model. The method outperforms state-of-the-art activation steering techniques when scaled with thousands of steering prompts, demonstrating superior performance even on unseen prompts. Additionally, HyperSteer achieves comparable results to steering-via-prompting methods. This approach combines the benefits of unsupervised and supervised learning, providing targeted and effective steering vectors without the need for extensive data collection and training for each vector. The end-to-end training of HyperSteer allows for control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks, offering improved efficacy in controlling text generation using language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering language models (LMs) by modifying internal activations is a popular approach for controlling text generation. Unsupervised dictionary learning methods, e.g., sparse autoencoders, can be scaled to produce many steering vectors, but lack guarantees on the individual efficacy of each vector and control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks. In contrast, supervised methods for constructing steering vectors are targeted and effective, but require more data collection and training for each additional steering vector produced. In this work, we introduce HyperSteer, a family of hypernetwork-based architectures which are trained end-to-end to generate steering vectors conditioned on the natural language steering prompts and the internals of the steered LM. In our evaluations, we show that scaling HyperSteer with thousands of steering prompts exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art activation steering methods, even on steering prompts never seen during training. Moreover, HyperSteer performs on par with steering-via-prompting.

<div> Fine-Tuning, Reasoning Potential, Language Models, Critique, Efficiency  
Summary:  
- The study explores unleashing reasoning potential in large language models (LLMs) like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 using Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT).  
- Previous research has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is costly and unstable to improve reasoning capabilities in LLMs.  
- The proposed one-shot CFT method collects diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and uses teacher LLMs to provide critiques for fine-tuning.  
- Fine-tuning LLMs like Qwen and Llama family models on CFT data resulted in significant performance improvements across various reasoning tasks, surpassing results from RL with less computational resources.  
- With just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT achieved an average improvement of 15% on math benchmarks and 16% on logic reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of one-shot CFT in unleashing reasoning capabilities in modern LLMs.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.

Abstract: This study presents an approach that uses large language models such as GPT-4 to generate usage policies in the W3C Open Digital Rights Language ODRL automatically from natural language instructions. Our approach uses the ODRL ontology and its documentation as a central part of the prompt. Our research hypothesis is that a curated version of existing ontology documentation will better guide policy generation. We present various heuristics for adapting the ODRL ontology and its documentation to guide an end-to-end KG construction process. We evaluate our approach in the context of dataspaces, i.e., distributed infrastructures for trustworthy data exchange between multiple participating organizations for the cultural domain. We created a benchmark consisting of 12 use cases of varying complexity. Our evaluation shows excellent results with up to 91.95% accuracy in the resulting knowledge graph.

Summary:
Hopscotch is a novel method for optimizing causal language models by identifying and skipping attention blocks with minimal contributions to a task. It introduces trainable scaling parameters to mitigate distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks, while preserving output quality. Hopscotch does not require modification of model weights, access to pretraining data, or instruction-tuning data. It is compatible with existing model compression techniques and offers flexibility in determining which blocks to skip. When applied to models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-7B, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks. <div>

Abstract: Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.

<div> Keywords: AI-generated texts, human-authored texts, reader preferences, literary quality, evaluation frameworks

Summary: 
This study explores the differing opinions on the quality of AI-generated and human-authored literary texts based on reader preferences. By analyzing 17 textual features and modeling individual reader preferences, the study identifies two main reader profiles: surface-focused readers and holistic readers. Surface-focused readers prioritize readability and textual richness, while holistic readers value thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. The results show that measurements of literary quality are influenced by how well text features align with each reader's preferences. The study highlights the importance of incorporating reader-sensitive evaluation frameworks in the field of creative text generation. <div>
arXiv:2506.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies comparing AI-generated and human-authored literary texts have produced conflicting results: some suggest AI already surpasses human quality, while others argue it still falls short. We start from the hypothesis that such divergences can be largely explained by genuine differences in how readers interpret and value literature, rather than by an intrinsic quality of the texts evaluated. Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators including critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less textual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence length...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature importance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze these vectors in a shared "preference space". Reader vectors cluster into two profiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize readability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who value thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. Our results quantitatively explain how measurements of literary quality are a function of how text features align with each reader's preferences. These findings advocate for reader-sensitive evaluation frameworks in the field of creative text generation.

To evaluate the signal present in this dataset, we perform a machine learning analysis with an existing dataset of violent comments from YouTube. We find that, despite originating from different platforms and using different coding criteria, we achieve high classification accuracy both by training on one dataset and testing on the other, and in a merged dataset condition.

Summary: 
Our study focuses on detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by introducing a novel method called "Ask a Local". This method leverages the surprise exhibited by specialized models when encountering domain-specific inaccuracies to identify potentially hallucinated information. Our approach computes the divergence between perplexity distributions of language-specialized models and does not require adaptation or extensive training, making it scalable for multiple languages. We achieve consistent performance across 14 languages on a human-annotated question-answer dataset, with high Intersection-over-Union (IoU) scores and Spearman correlation values. Particularly strong results were seen in Italian and Catalan. Our model is computationally efficient and effective without the need for language-specific adaptations. The code and architecture are released to encourage further research in multilingual hallucination detection.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) - instances where models generate plausible but factually incorrect information - present a significant challenge for AI.
  We introduce "Ask a Local", a novel hallucination detection method exploiting the intuition that specialized models exhibit greater surprise when encountering domain-specific inaccuracies. Our approach computes divergence between perplexity distributions of language-specialized models to identify potentially hallucinated spans. Our method is particularly well-suited for a multilingual context, as it naturally scales to multiple languages without the need for adaptation, relying on external data sources, or performing training. Moreover, we select computationally efficient models, providing a scalable solution that can be applied to a wide range of languages and domains.
  Our results on a human-annotated question-answer dataset spanning 14 languages demonstrate consistent performance across languages, with Intersection-over-Union (IoU) scores around 0.3 and comparable Spearman correlation values. Our model shows particularly strong performance on Italian and Catalan, with IoU scores of 0.42 and 0.38, respectively, while maintaining cross-lingual effectiveness without language-specific adaptations. We release our code and architecture to facilitate further research in multilingual hallucination detection.

Abstract: Rapid, fine-grained disaster damage assessment is essential for effective emergency response, yet remains challenging due to limited ground sensors and delays in official reporting. Social media provides a rich, real-time source of human-centric observations, but its multimodal and unstructured nature presents challenges for traditional analytical methods. In this study, we propose a structured Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional (3M) pipeline that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to assess disaster impacts. We evaluate three foundation models across two major earthquake events using both macro- and micro-level analyses. Results show that MLLMs effectively integrate image-text signals and demonstrate a strong correlation with ground-truth seismic data. However, performance varies with language, epicentral distance, and input modality. This work highlights the potential of MLLMs for disaster assessment and provides a foundation for future research in applying MLLMs to real-time crisis contexts.

<br />
DistRAG is a novel approach developed to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like POI recommendation and itinerary planning. This approach encodes geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph, allowing the LLM to retrieve relevant spatial information necessary to answer distance-based reasoning questions. By enabling LLMs to access context subgraphs related to the question at hand, DistRAG bridges the gap in the LLMs' understanding of distances and spatial relationships. This method represents a crucial step in providing LLMs with a basic 'world model' that complements their linguistic knowledge, thus improving their performance on spatial reasoning tasks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real world tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used require spatial reasoning, like Point of Interest (POI) recommendation and itinerary planning. However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about, DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs.

<div> evolution, factual knowledge representation, large language models, attention heads, feed forward networks

Summary:
The study investigates how large language models like OLMo-7B acquire and store factual knowledge. It analyzes the roles of attention heads and feed forward networks during pre-training, categorizing them into general, entity, relation-answer, and fact-answer specific roles. Results indicate that initially, LLMs use broad, general-purpose components that gradually specialize. As the model improves prediction accuracy, some components are repurposed, demonstrating adaptive learning. Attention heads show high turnover, while FFNs remain more stable.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) acquire and store factual knowledge is crucial for enhancing their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we analyze the evolution of factual knowledge representation in the OLMo-7B model by tracking the roles of its attention heads and feed forward networks (FFNs) over the course of pre-training. We classify these components into four roles: general, entity, relation-answer, and fact-answer specific, and examine their stability and transitions. Our results show that LLMs initially depend on broad, general-purpose components, which later specialize as training progresses. Once the model reliably predicts answers, some components are repurposed, suggesting an adaptive learning process. Notably, attention heads display the highest turnover. We also present evidence that FFNs remain more stable throughout training. Furthermore, our probing experiments reveal that location-based relations converge to high accuracy earlier in training than name-based relations, highlighting how task complexity shapes acquisition dynamics. These insights offer a mechanistic view of knowledge formation in LLMs.

Abstract: Toxic language detection is crucial for creating safer online environments and limiting the spread of harmful content. While toxic language detection has been under-explored in Persian, the current work compares different methods for this task, including fine-tuning, data enrichment, zero-shot and few-shot learning, and cross-lingual transfer learning. What is especially compelling is the impact of cultural context on transfer learning for this task: We show that the language of a country with cultural similarities to Persian yields better results in transfer learning. Conversely, the improvement is lower when the language comes from a culturally distinct country. Warning: This paper contains examples of toxic language that may disturb some readers. These examples are included for the purpose of research on toxic detection.

<div> Keywords: Alzheimer's Disease, Large Language Models, in-context learning, Delta-KNN, diagnosis

Summary: 
This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) based on patient-generated text using in-context learning (ICL). Traditional ICL methods show poor performance for AD diagnosis due to task complexity. To overcome this, the novel Delta-KNN method is introduced, which involves a delta score to evaluate training examples and a KNN-based retriever to select optimal representatives. Experimental results on two AD detection datasets using three LLMs demonstrate that Delta-KNN outperforms existing ICL baselines. Notably, the approach achieves new state-of-the-art results with the Llama-3.1 model, surpassing supervised classifiers. Overall, this study highlights the potential of LLMs and Delta-KNN in improving AD diagnosis through text analysis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dementia, and early intervention can greatly benefit from analyzing linguistic abnormalities. In this work, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as health assistants for AD diagnosis from patient-generated text using in-context learning (ICL), where tasks are defined through a few input-output examples. Empirical results reveal that conventional ICL methods, such as similarity-based selection, perform poorly for AD diagnosis, likely due to the inherent complexity of this task. To address this, we introduce Delta-KNN, a novel demonstration selection strategy that enhances ICL performance. Our method leverages a delta score to assess the relative gains of each training example, coupled with a KNN-based retriever that dynamically selects optimal "representatives" for a given input. Experiments on two AD detection datasets across three open-source LLMs demonstrate that Delta-KNN consistently outperforms existing ICL baselines. Notably, when using the Llama-3.1 model, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results, surpassing even supervised classifiers.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, domain-specific fine-tuning, APT, weakness data, downstream tasks

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning for targeted tasks, which can compromise their general capabilities. The APT approach, which stands for Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training, aims to enhance domain-specific performance by utilizing self-generated dis-preferred weakness data. By focusing on training the model with error samples and a small set of similar cases, APT minimizes interference with the model's existing knowledge base while maintaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models show that APT achieves superior performance on downstream tasks without reducing generic capacity. This approach proves to be an effective strategy for improving domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's broader applicability.<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models often need domain-specific fine-tuning that can weaken their overall performance. The APT approach uses self-generated weakness data to enhance domain-specific performance while preserving the model's generic capabilities. By focusing on error samples and similar cases, APT achieves superior results on downstream tasks without compromising the model's broader utility. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities. Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT (Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data (bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's broader applicability.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving the performance of AI models, going beyond providing model transparency and interpretability. The scarcity of labeled data remains a fundamental challenge in developing robust and generalizable AI models, particularly for low-resource languages. Conventional data augmentation techniques introduce noise, cause semantic drift, disrupt contextual coherence, lack control, and lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation. This novel framework leverages XAI techniques to modify less critical features while selectively preserving most task-relevant features. Our approach integrates an iterative feedback loop, which refines augmented data over multiple augmentation cycles based on explainability-driven insights and the model performance gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT improve the accuracy of models on hate speech and sentiment analysis tasks by 6.6% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline, using the Amharic dataset with the XLM-R model. XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT outperform existing augmentation techniques by 4.8% and 5%, respectively, on the same dataset and model. Overall, XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT consistently outperform both baseline and conventional augmentation techniques across all tasks and models. This study provides a more controlled, interpretable, and context-aware solution to data augmentation, addressing critical limitations of existing augmentation techniques and offering a new paradigm shift for leveraging XAI techniques to enhance AI model training.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on the availability of abundant high-quality training data. However, the high cost of acquiring annotated data often prevents models from obtaining capabilities to tackle downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, EpiCoDe that boosts model performance in data-scarcity scenarios without extra training. We first employ model extrapolation to enhance a finetuned model with its inferior version, and then adopt contrastive decoding to further reduce predicted errors, by comparing the logit scores given by the extrapolated and the vanilla finetuned model. Experiments across three tasks over four different LLMs show that EpiCoDe consistently outperforms existing methods with significant and robust improvement. We also propose a new theoretical framework to reveal the mechanism behind contrastive decoding in data-scarcity scenarios, which further helps us better understand the effectiveness of EpiCoDe.

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) and its application in the medical domain. It presents a new framework called MedEditBench to evaluate existing KE methods in the medical field. The study reveals that current KE methods only lead to superficial memorization and lack generalization to new scenarios. A novel approach called Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit) is proposed, which utilizes model-derived rationales for editing, showing significant improvements over existing methods. The article also discusses the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This research offers valuable insights for implementing KE methods in real-world medical applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a promising approach to update specific facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for full retraining. Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical applications.

Summary: 
Content creation has evolved with advances in large language models like ChatGPT and Claude, but this has led to concerns about the use of generative AI in academic writing. Current methods for detecting AI-generated text are inadequate, as they overlook human collaboration in content generation. This study introduces a novel approach using BERTScore to measure human involvement in generating content and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor for detection. The proposed method was tested on simulated academic scenarios with varying levels of human involvement and outperformed existing detectors, achieving a high F1 score and low mean squared error. The approach showed promise in detecting human involvement across generative models, providing a more robust solution for identifying AI-generated content in academic settings. The code for this method is available on GitHub for further exploration and application. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content creation has dramatically progressed with the rapid advancement of large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. While this progress has greatly enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability across generative models.

- The slow inference speed of LLMs is a hindrance to their performance in various applications due to the stack of numerous sublayers.  
- Existing sublayer pruning algorithms lack accuracy as they overlook the unique characteristics of each sublayer.

Abstract: How can we accelerate large language models(LLMs) without sacrificing accuracy? The slow inference speed of LLMs hinders us to benefit from their remarkable performance in diverse applications. This is mainly because numerous sublayers are stacked together in LLMs. Sublayer pruning compresses and expedites LLMs via removing unnecessary sublayers. However, existing sublayer pruning algorithms are limited in accuracy since they naively select sublayers to prune, overlooking the different characteristics of each sublayer. In this paper, we propose SPRINT (Sublayer PRuning wIth LateNcy and Tunability Information), an accurate sublayer pruning method for LLMs. SPRINT accurately selects a target sublayer to prune by considering 1) the amount of latency reduction after pruning and 2) the tunability of sublayers. SPRINT iteratively prunes redundant sublayers and swiftly tunes the parameters of remaining sublayers. Experiments show that SPRINT achieves the best accuracy-speedup trade-off, exhibiting up to 23.88%p higher accuracy on zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks compared to existing pruning algorithms.

Summary:<br /><br />Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is commonly used in dialogue systems but struggles with exploration and exploitation balancing. Combining Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with DRL helps maintain population diversity, enhancing the balance between exploration and exploitation in dialogue policy optimization. The integration faces challenges due to the flexible nature of natural language, increasing evolutionary times. An elite individual injection (EII) mechanism is proposed to efficiently introduce top-performing individuals into the population, reducing exploration time. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the improved performance of the approach in task-oriented dialogue policy tasks. The EII mechanism effectively enhances search efficiency and facilitates the integration of EA and DRL for more efficient exploration and exploitation balance. <div>
arXiv:2506.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used in task-oriented dialogue systems to optimize dialogue policy, but it struggles to balance exploration and exploitation due to the high dimensionality of state and action spaces. This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times. Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance EA's search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals into the population. Experiments across four datasets show that our approach significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation, boosting performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the EII mechanism in reducing exploration time has been demonstrated, achieving an efficient integration of EA and DRL on task-oriented dialogue policy tasks.

<br />
Summary: Tokenization is a crucial step for Large Language Models (LLMs) but can be inefficient in new domains or languages, slowing down training and generation. TokAlign is proposed to address this issue by aligning source vocabulary with target vocabulary through a one-to-one mapping matrix for token IDs. This method improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for LLMs, reducing perplexity and enhancing model performance. TokAlign enables efficient restoration of model performance with minimal steps and facilitates token-level distillation to boost base model performance with low token costs. This approach demonstrates effectiveness and generalization across models of different parameter scales, showcasing the potential for improving LLM efficiency and knowledge transfer.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization serves as a foundational step for Large Language Models (LLMs) to process text. In new domains or languages, the inefficiency of the tokenizer will slow down the training and generation of LLM. The mismatch in vocabulary also hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level distillation. To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named TokAlign to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view, and further transfer the token-level knowledge between models. It first aligns the source vocabulary to the target one by learning a one-to-one mapping matrix for token IDs. Model parameters, including embeddings, are rearranged and progressively fine-tuned for the new vocabulary. Our method significantly improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for LLMs, decreasing the perplexity from 3.4$\text{e}^2$ of strong baseline methods to 1.2$\text{e}^2$ after initialization. Experimental results on models across multiple parameter scales demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of TokAlign, which costs as few as 5k steps to restore the performance of the vanilla model. After unifying vocabularies between LLMs, token-level distillation can remarkably boost (+4.4% than sentence-level distillation) the base model, costing only 235M tokens.

Abstract: Code data in large language model (LLM) pretraining is recognized crucial not only for code-related tasks but also for enhancing general intelligence of LLMs. Current open-source LLMs often heavily rely on human effort to produce their code pretraining data, such as employing hand-crafted filtering rules tailored to individual programming languages, or using human-annotated data to train quality filters. However, these approaches are inherently limited in scalability, prone to subjective biases, and costly to extend and maintain across diverse programming languages. To address these challenges, we introduce Seed-Coder, a series of open-source LLMs comprising base, instruct and reasoning models of 8B size, minimizing human involvement in data construction. Our code pretraining data is produced by a model-centric data pipeline, which predominantly leverages LLMs for scoring and filtering code data. The instruct model is further trained via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, and the reasoning model leverages Long-Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reinforcement learning to improve multi-step code reasoning. Seed-Coder achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size and even surpasses some much larger models, demonstrating superior performance in code generation, code completion, code editing, code reasoning, and software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to set new standards in knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks, yet their high computational demands limit widespread adoption. While distilling large models into smaller ones offers a sustainable solution, current techniques--such as static knowledge distillation, resource-intensive reinforcement learning from human feedback, or limited self-reflection--struggle to yield substantial and lasting performance gains. In this paper, we present a novel Debate and Reflect (D&amp;R) framework that orchestrates multi-turn debates between smaller models and stronger teacher models, eliciting actionable feedback (e.g., error analysis, corrective strategies) to guide student models. Further, we introduce Tree-structured Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) to efficiently leverage these debate logs, organizing interactions into a hierarchical format for effective training. Empirical evaluations across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves smaller-model accuracy, robustness, and generalization, outperforming conventional baselines by a large margin.

<div> Keywords: Direct Preference Optimization, Large Language Models, Balanced Preference Optimization, mathematical reasoning tasks, pairwise ranking losses

Summary:
Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO) addresses the Degraded Chosen Responses issue in Large Language Models by dynamically balancing the optimization of chosen and rejected responses. BPO introduces two key components: balanced reward margin and gap adaptor, which significantly outperform Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on various mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that BPO boosts accuracy by 10.1% with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 11.7% with Qwen2.5-Math-7B compared to DPO. Furthermore, BPO surpasses DPO variants such as IPO, SLiC, and Cal-DPO by significant margins on the same model. Notably, BPO requires only a single line of code modification, making it easy to implement and compatible with existing DPO-based frameworks. <div>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as a popular method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO effectively preserves the relative ordering between chosen and rejected responses through pairwise ranking losses, it often neglects absolute reward magnitudes. This oversight can decrease the likelihood of chosen responses and increase the risk of generating out-of-distribution responses, leading to poor performance. We term this issue Degraded Chosen Responses (DCR).To address this issue, we propose Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO), a novel framework that dynamically balances the optimization of chosen and rejected responses through two key components: balanced reward margin and gap adaptor. Unlike previous methods, BPO can fundamentally resolve DPO's DCR issue, without introducing additional constraints to the loss function. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks show that BPO significantly outperforms DPO, improving accuracy by +10.1% with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (18.8% to 28.9%) and +11.7% with Qwen2.5-Math-7B (35.0% to 46.7%). It also surpasses DPO variants by +3.6% over IPO (43.1%), +5.0% over SLiC (41.7%), and +3.1% over Cal-DPO (43.6%) on the same model. Remarkably, our algorithm requires only a single line of code modification, making it simple to implement and fully compatible with existing DPO-based frameworks.

<div> intent modeling, multi-turn dialogue generation, conversation structure, instruction synthesis, dataset creation

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework, Skeleton-Guided Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation, aimed at improving multi-turn instruction synthesis. The framework consists of two stages: Intent Modeling and Skeleton Generation. Intent Modeling assigns conversations to predefined intent trajectories to ensure coherent information flow, while Skeleton Generation creates structured user queries aligned with the modeled intent. The framework is used to create ConsistentChat, a dataset with 15,000 multi-turn conversations. Experiments show that models fine-tuned on ConsistentChat outperform those trained on existing datasets, achieving a 20-30% improvement in chat consistency and up to a 15% increase in task success rate. This approach addresses the issue of context drift and enhances task completion rates in extended conversations. The framework provides a structured approach to multi-turn dialogue generation that improves cross-turn coherence and overall conversation quality. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current instruction data synthesis methods primarily focus on single-turn instructions and often neglect cross-turn coherence, resulting in context drift and reduced task completion rates in extended conversations. To address this limitation, we propose Skeleton-Guided Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation, a framework that constrains multi-turn instruction synthesis by explicitly modeling human conversational intent. It operates in two stages: (1) Intent Modeling, which captures the global structure of human dialogues by assigning each conversation to one of nine well-defined intent trajectories, ensuring a coherent and goal-oriented information flow; and (2) Skeleton Generation, which constructs a structurally grounded sequence of user queries aligned with the modeled intent, thereby serving as a scaffold that constrains and guides the downstream instruction synthesis process. Based on this process, we construct ConsistentChat, a multi-turn instruction dataset with approximately 15,000 multi-turn conversations and 224,392 utterances. Experiments on the Light, Topdial, and MT-Eval benchmarks show that models fine-tuned on ConsistentChat achieve a 20-30% improvement in chat consistency and up to a 15% increase in task success rate, significantly outperforming models trained on existing single-turn and multi-turn instruction datasets.

Summary:
Position Specialists (PosS) is introduced to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging position-specialized draft layers. These specialists focus on generating tokens at specific positions, leading to improved token acceptance rates at later positions and minimizing error accumulation in draft model features. By assigning each specialist to handle a certain level of feature deviation, PosS significantly enhances token prediction accuracy in later positions compared to existing methods. Experimental results on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat datasets highlight the effectiveness of PosS in enhancing average acceptance length and speed-up ratio over baselines. The codebase for implementing PosS is also made available on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by using a small draft model to predict multiple tokens, and a large target model to verify these tokens in parallel. Recent studies leverage the hidden state of the target model to enhance draft model prediction accuracy. However, existing methods suffer from the degrading quality of draft token predictions at later positions, due to error accumulation in draft model generated features. In this paper, we propose Position Specialists (PosS), which consist of multiple position-specialized draft layers to generate tokens at assigned position(s). Position specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions per drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a certain level of draft model feature deviation. Experiment results on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat across six datasets demonstrate that PosS effectively improves over baselines on average acceptance length and speed-up ratio. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/shrango/PosS.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated that Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing model performance. However, training PRMs typically requires step-level labels, either manually annotated or automatically generated, which can be costly and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this challenge, we introduce FreePRM, a weakly supervised framework for training PRMs without access to ground-truth step-level labels. FreePRM first generates pseudo step-level labels based on the correctness of final outcome, and then employs Buffer Probability to eliminate impact of noise inherent in pseudo labeling. Experimental results show that FreePRM achieves an average F1 score of 53.0% on ProcessBench, outperforming fully supervised PRM trained on Math-Shepherd by +24.1%. Compared to other open-source PRMs, FreePRM outperforms upon RLHFlow-PRM-Mistral-8B (28.4%) by +24.6%, EurusPRM (31.3%) by +21.7%, and Skywork-PRM-7B (42.1%) by +10.9%. This work introduces a new paradigm in PRM training, significantly reducing reliance on costly step-level annotations while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in addressing diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performance is often limited by inherent comprehension of problems. To address this limitation, we propose Exchange-of-Perspective (EoP), a novel framework designed to exchange perspectives across different definitions of problem, so that it can break the fixed mindset from any particular formulation of the question. We conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on 8 benchmarks. The results show that EoP can significantly improve performance. For instance, compared to the non-commutative baseline PHP, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and EoP, we observe a 3.6% improvement on AQuA (60.6% to 64.2%), while GPT-4-powered EoP demonstrates a 7.7% overall accuracy enhancement on Math (53.9% to 61.6%) and a 3.5% improvement on OlympiadBench Maths (43.5% to 47.0%) when using Qwen-2.5-72b.

Summary:
KG-BiLM is introduced as a unified framework that combines symbolic knowledge graphs with language models for enhanced semantic understanding. It integrates Bidirectional Knowledge Attention to allow full interaction among tokens and entities, Knowledge-Masked Prediction to utilize both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity, and Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation to preserve KG structure through contrastive alignment. Experimental results show that KG-BiLM surpasses existing methods in link prediction tasks, particularly on complex multi-hop relations in large-scale graphs. This validates its capability to unify structural information and textual semantics effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models (LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii) Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural information and textual semantics.

Summary: 
This study explores the use of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to provide example sentences for L2 Japanese learners. PLMs are employed in a retrieval system and as sentence generators for learners of varying proficiency levels. The quality of sentences is evaluated based on difficulty, diversity, and naturalness by learners of Japanese, native speakers, and GPT-4. While there is disagreement among participants on sentence ratings, the retrieval approach is preferred, especially for beginner and advanced proficiency levels. The generative approaches receive lower scores on average. Overall, the study suggests the potential of using PLMs to improve sentence suggestion systems and enhance the language learning process.

Abstract: Providing example sentences that are diverse and aligned with learners' proficiency levels is essential for fostering effective language acquisition. This study examines the use of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce example sentences targeting L2 Japanese learners. We utilize PLMs in two ways: as quality scoring components in a retrieval system that draws from a newly curated corpus of Japanese sentences, and as direct sentence generators using zero-shot learning. We evaluate the quality of sentences by considering multiple aspects such as difficulty, diversity, and naturalness, with a panel of raters consisting of learners of Japanese, native speakers -- and GPT-4. Our findings suggest that there is inherent disagreement among participants on the ratings of sentence qualities, except for difficulty. Despite that, the retrieval approach was preferred by all evaluators, especially for beginner and advanced target proficiency, while the generative approaches received lower scores on average. Even so, our experiments highlight the potential for using PLMs to enhance the adaptability of sentence suggestion systems and therefore improve the language learning journey.

Abstract: Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time. We plan to publish our benchmark adaptions.

Summary: <br />
Data augmentation involves generating synthetic data examples to augment training data. Two types of augmentation strategies, linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated, were compared for low-resource languages Uspanteko and Arapaho. The study evaluated the effectiveness of different strategies for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation and interlinear glossing. Results showed that linguistically-motivated strategies can be beneficial over naive approaches, but only when the new examples align with the training data distribution. This comparison sheds light on the impact of linguistic expertise in data augmentation and its implications for downstream performance in low-resource language tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation, a widely-employed technique for addressing data scarcity, involves generating synthetic data examples which are then used to augment available training data. Researchers have seen surprising success from simple methods, such as random perturbations from natural examples, where models seem to benefit even from data with nonsense words, or data that doesn't conform to the rules of the language. A second line of research produces synthetic data that does in fact follow all linguistic constraints; these methods require some linguistic expertise and are generally more challenging to implement. No previous work has done a systematic, empirical comparison of both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated data augmentation strategies, leaving uncertainty about whether the additional time and effort of linguistically-motivated data augmentation work in fact yields better downstream performance.
  In this work, we conduct a careful and comprehensive comparison of augmentation strategies (both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated) for two low-resource languages with different morphological properties, Uspanteko and Arapaho. We evaluate the effectiveness of many different strategies and their combinations across two important sequence-to-sequence tasks for low-resource languages: machine translation and interlinear glossing. We find that linguistically-motivated strategies can have benefits over naive approaches, but only when the new examples they produce are not significantly unlike the training data distribution.

Abstract: Using the best Text-to-SQL methods in resource-constrained environments is challenging due to their reliance on resource-intensive open-source models. This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL translation. Our method decomposes the task into schema filtering, retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.

Summary:
Dynamic Inserting Tokens Training (DIT) is a novel approach to enhancing reasoning capabilities in transformer-based large language models (LLMs). By strategically inserting [PAUSE] tokens at positions where model confidence is lowest, DIT improves predictive capabilities for subsequent tokens. Experimental results across various datasets and models show that DIT outperforms traditional fine-tuning and previous token insertion methods. With accuracy gains of up to 4.7%p on GSM8K, 3.23%p on AQUA-RAT, and pass@1 improvements of up to 3.4%p on MBPP datasets, DIT proves to be a simple yet effective method. This model-based, dynamic approach broadens the scope of research in reasoning, offering a new way to boost the performance of transformer models in natural language processing tasks.


<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance reasoning capabilities, previous works have explored incorporating special-purpose tokens into the training process. These strategies strengthen the learning mechanism of transformer-based large language models (LLMs). Building on prior research, in which inserting dummy tokens consecutively just before reasoning steps can enhance effectiveness, we introduce a novel approach termed Dynamic Inserting Tokens Training (DIT). Our method identifies positions within sequences where model confidence is lowest according to token log-likelihood. Strategically inserting [PAUSE] tokens on these positions bolsters the model's predictive capabilities for subsequent tokens. Experimental results across diverse datasets and models, from the 2.7B model to the 8B model, demonstrate that DIT consistently outperforms traditional fine-tuning and previous token insertion methods. With this simple yet effective method, we achieve accuracy gains of up to 4.7%p on GSM8K, 3.23%p on AQUA-RAT, and pass@1 improvements of up to 3.4%p on MBPP datasets. Our work shows a model-based, dynamic approach rather than a heuristic one, thereby broadening the scope of research in reasoning.

Summary:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) typically lack cultural knowledge beyond English-speaking communities, leading to marginalization of non-English cultures. To address this issue, researchers have focused on evaluating and developing culturally aware LLMs. This study examines LLMs' knowledge of Japanese folktales, specifically Yokai, supernatural creatures from Japanese folklore. The researchers created YokaiEval, a dataset of 809 multiple-choice questions about Yokai, to assess LLMs' cultural awareness. They tested 31 Japanese and multilingual LLMs on this dataset and found that models trained with Japanese resources outperformed English-centric ones. Models that underwent continued pretraining in Japanese, especially those based on Llama-3, showed the highest accuracy. By providing the YokaiEval dataset and code, this study aims to promote the development of culturally aware LLMs that can better understand and represent diverse cultural backgrounds. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong language understanding and generation abilities across various languages, their cultural knowledge is often limited to English-speaking communities, which can marginalize the cultures of non-English communities. To address the problem, evaluation of the cultural awareness of the LLMs and the methods to develop culturally aware LLMs have been investigated. In this study, we focus on evaluating knowledge of folktales, a key medium for conveying and circulating culture. In particular, we focus on Japanese folktales, specifically on knowledge of Yokai. Yokai are supernatural creatures originating from Japanese folktales that continue to be popular motifs in art and entertainment today. Yokai have long served as a medium for cultural expression, making them an ideal subject for assessing the cultural awareness of LLMs. We introduce YokaiEval, a benchmark dataset consisting of 809 multiple-choice questions (each with four options) designed to probe knowledge about yokai. We evaluate the performance of 31 Japanese and multilingual LLMs on this dataset. The results show that models trained with Japanese language resources achieve higher accuracy than English-centric models, with those that underwent continued pretraining in Japanese, particularly those based on Llama-3, performing especially well. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/CyberAgentA ILab/YokaiEval.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Robustness, Prompting strategy, Error Correction, Guidance

Summary:
Robustness of Prompting (RoP) is a novel prompting strategy designed to enhance the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs). RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error Correction stage, RoP generates prompts that automatically correct input errors caused by perturbations. These prompts are then used to guide the model towards more accurate inferences. Through experiments on arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, RoP demonstrated significant improvements in LLM robustness against adversarial perturbations. The strategy maintained high model accuracy with minimal degradation compared to clean input scenarios. RoP proves to be a practical and effective approach for enhancing the overall robustness of LLMs in real-world applications.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- Introduction of Robustness of Prompting (RoP) strategy to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) robustness.
- RoP comprises Error Correction and Guidance stages to address input perturbations and improve model accuracy.
- Experimental results across various tasks show significant improvements in LLM robustness with RoP.
- RoP maintains high model accuracy even with adversarial perturbations, making it a practical approach for real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks by effectively utilizing a prompting strategy. However, they are highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance. Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world applications.

Summary:
Reward models (RMs) are crucial for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) but often lack adaptability to diverse needs. Existing RMs are trained on fixed preference datasets, limiting their flexibility. To address this, the authors propose a new approach where RMs can understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language reward principles. They introduce RABench, a benchmark to evaluate RMs' generalization capabilities. Current RMs show poor generalization, highlighting the need for improvement. The authors present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed to follow natural language principles, achieving state-of-the-art performance. RewardAnything can adapt to new principles without retraining and integrates well with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods. A case study demonstrates how RewardAnything can efficiently align LLMs with natural language principles automatically. This approach offers a more flexible and adaptable way to train RMs for diverse real-world applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.

Abstract: Trustworthiness in healthcare question-answering (QA) systems is important for ensuring patient safety, clinical effectiveness, and user confidence. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into medical settings, the reliability of their responses directly influences clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. However, achieving comprehensive trustworthiness in medical QA poses significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of healthcare data, the critical nature of clinical scenarios, and the multifaceted dimensions of trustworthy AI. In this survey, we systematically examine six key dimensions of trustworthiness in medical QA, i.e., Factuality, Robustness, Fairness, Safety, Explainability, and Calibration. We review how each dimension is evaluated in existing LLM-based medical QA systems. We compile and compare major benchmarks designed to assess these dimensions and analyze evaluation-guided techniques that drive model improvements, such as retrieval-augmented grounding, adversarial fine-tuning, and safety alignment. Finally, we identify open challenges-such as scalable expert evaluation, integrated multi-dimensional metrics, and real-world deployment studies-and propose future research directions to advance the safe, reliable, and transparent deployment of LLM-powered medical QA.

Summary:<br />
Visually impaired individuals often face challenges in using Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems due to misaligned text in photos. Current VQA models struggle with recognizing text captured by visually impaired users. The study introduces the ROtated SAmpling (ROSA) decoding strategy to improve VQA performance in images with incorrectly oriented text. Through in-depth interviews with visually impaired individuals, common framing conventions leading to misaligned text were identified. Existing VQA benchmarks do not adequately address these challenges, as they primarily feature well-oriented text from sighted users. ROSA outperforms Greedy decoding by 11.7 absolute points in the best-performing model, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing text recognition issues for visually impaired users.

<div> Keywords: ASR adaptation, data selection, pseudo-labeling, fine-tuning, named entity recognition

Summary:<br /><br />
The article discusses the challenges faced by small organizations in fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains due to limited labeled data and computational resources. The authors propose a robust approach that involves filtering pseudo-labels generated using Whisper and Zipformer models to improve ASR adaptation. This approach integrates various data selection strategies such as WER prediction, NER, and CER analysis to extract high-quality training segments. Evaluation on Whisper and Zipformer with a 7500-hour baseline dataset shows promising results. Fine-tuning on 7500 hours of pseudo-labeled call center data achieves a 12.3% WER, while dataset filtering reduces it to 100 hours (1.4%) with similar performance. This trend is also observed on Fisher English data. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed data selection pipeline in enhancing ASR adaptation for specific domains with limited resources. <div>

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging for small organizations with limited labeled data and computational resources. Here, we explore different data selection pipelines and propose a robust approach that improves ASR adaptation by filtering pseudo-labels generated using Whisper (encoder-decoder) and Zipformer (transducer) models. Our approach integrates multiple selection strategies -- including word error rate (WER) prediction, named entity recognition (NER), and character error rate (CER) analysis -- to extract high-quality training segments. We evaluate our method on Whisper and Zipformer using a 7500-hour baseline, comparing it to a CER-based approach relying on hypotheses from three ASR systems. Fine-tuning on 7500 hours of pseudo-labeled call center data achieves 12.3% WER, while our filtering reduces the dataset to 100 hours (1.4%) with similar performance; a similar trend is observed on Fisher English.

Summary:
The article introduces a new algorithm called $\gamma$-PO for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment by dynamically adjusting reward margins at the pairwise level. This algorithm aims to prioritize high-confidence preference pairs and suppress noise from ambiguous pairs, enhancing the overall data quality. $\gamma$-PO is compatible with variants of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and achieves a significant average improvement of 4.4% over other baselines in benchmarks like AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes models using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands. However, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is frequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose $\gamma$-PO, a dynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward margins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin calibration, $\gamma$-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those demonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from ambiguous pairs. Moreover, $\gamma$-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible with variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs. Across benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, $\gamma$-PO achieves an average 4.4\% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, $\gamma$-PO requires minimal code changes and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust solution for enhancing LLMs alignment.

<div> Efficient decoding, Large language models, AdaDecode, Token generation, Output consistency <br />
Summary: <br />
AdaDecode is a new method for accelerating the decoding process of Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for additional models or changes to the original parameters. By generating tokens at intermediate layers with high confidence, AdaDecode allows for parallel processing of subsequent tokens, maximizing hardware utilization and reducing decoding latency. This approach ensures output consistency through a final verification step. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaDecode consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 1.73x speedup in decoding throughput while maintaining output parity with standard autoregressive decoding. <div>
arXiv:2506.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content generation (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency becomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by its sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated before the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the ability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities. Existing methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential speedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an auxiliary "drafter" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases memory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the outputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we propose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary models or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output consistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be generated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly alter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively generating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode enables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer computations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel with subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and reducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early predictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving output parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode consistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup, while guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding.

Abstract: This research introduces ScoreRAG, an approach to enhance the quality of automated news generation. Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing and large language models, current news generation methods often struggle with hallucinations, factual inconsistencies, and lack of domain-specific expertise when producing news articles. ScoreRAG addresses these challenges through a multi-stage framework combining retrieval-augmented generation, consistency relevance evaluation, and structured summarization. The system first retrieves relevant news documents from a vector database, maps them to complete news items, and assigns consistency relevance scores based on large language model evaluations. These documents are then reranked according to relevance, with low-quality items filtered out. The framework proceeds to generate graded summaries based on relevance scores, which guide the large language model in producing complete news articles following professional journalistic standards. Through this methodical approach, ScoreRAG aims to significantly improve the accuracy, coherence, informativeness, and professionalism of generated news articles while maintaining stability and consistency throughout the generation process.

Abstract: Applying large pre-trained speech models like Whisper has shown promise in reducing training costs for various speech tasks. However, integrating these models into streaming systems remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel prefix-to-prefix training framework for streaming recognition by fine-tuning the Whisper. We introduce the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire mechanism to establish a quasi-monotonic alignment between continuous speech sequences and discrete text tokens. Additionally, we design Monotonic Finite Look-ahead Attention, allowing each token to attend to infinite left-context and finite right-context from the speech sequences. We also employ the wait-k decoding strategy to simplify the decoding process while ensuring consistency between training and testing. Our theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves a controllable trade-off between latency and quality, making it suitable for various streaming applications.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the importance of uncertainty calibration in large language models (LLMs) for safe deployment, particularly in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning scenarios. It introduces a novel approach where supervised fine-tuning with confidence labels alone induces self-verification behavior in language models. Without explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement learning, the model learns to provide longer self-checked responses for low-confidence queries and concise answers for high-confidence ones. A rethinking method is proposed to scale performance based on calibrated uncertainty, improving calibration, accuracy, and interpretability. Experimental results on GSM8K and reasoning tasks like MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge demonstrate that confidence-aware fine-tuning enhances both calibration and accuracy, aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence levels. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is essential for the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly when users rely on verbalized confidence estimates. While prior work has focused on classifiers or short-form generation, confidence calibration for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning remains largely unexplored. Surprisingly, we find that supervised fine-tuning with scalar confidence labels alone suffices to elicit self-verification behavior of language models, without any explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement learning-based rewards. Despite being trained only to produce a verbalized confidence score without any self-verifying examples, the model learns to generate longer and self-checking responses for low-confidence queries while providing more concise answers for high-confidence ones. We further propose a simple rethinking method that boosts performance via test-time scaling based on calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on GSM8K and held-out reasoning tasks such as MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge show that our confidence-aware fine-tuning improves both calibration and accuracy, while also enhancing interpretability by aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence.

Abstract: Visuals are valuable tools for teaching math word problems (MWPs), helping young learners interpret textual descriptions into mathematical expressions before solving them. However, creating such visuals is labor-intensive and there is a lack of automated methods to support this process. In this paper, we present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs. Using Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset, demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation. Our work establishes a new benchmark for automated generation of pedagogically meaningful visuals and offers insights into key challenges in producing multimodal educational content, such as the misrepresentation of mathematical relationships and the omission of essential visual elements.

Abstract: As interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for interactive and emotionally rich experiences grows, virtual pet companionship emerges as a novel yet underexplored application. Existing approaches focus on basic pet role-playing interactions without systematically benchmarking LLMs for comprehensive companionship. In this paper, we introduce Pet-Bench, a dedicated benchmark that evaluates LLMs across both self-interaction and human-interaction dimensions. Unlike prior work, Pet-Bench emphasizes self-evolution and developmental behaviors alongside interactive engagement, offering a more realistic reflection of pet companionship. It features diverse tasks such as intelligent scheduling, memory-based dialogues, and psychological conversations, with over 7,500 interaction instances designed to simulate complex pet behaviors. Evaluation of 28 LLMs reveals significant performance variations linked to model size and inherent capabilities, underscoring the need for specialized optimization in this domain. Pet-Bench serves as a foundational resource for benchmarking pet-related LLM abilities and advancing emotionally immersive human-pet interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the (Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores. To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism, AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.

Abstract: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been enhanced by training on data that reflects human thought processes, such as the Chain-of-Thought format. However, evidence suggests that the conventional scheme of next-word prediction may not fully capture how humans learn to think. Inspired by how humans generalize mathematical reasoning, we propose a new approach named ClozeMath to fine-tune LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our ClozeMath involves a text-infilling task that predicts masked equations from a given solution, analogous to cloze exercises used in human learning. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and GSM-Symbolic show that ClozeMath surpasses the strong baseline Masked Thought in performance and robustness, with two test-time scaling decoding algorithms, Beam Search and Chain-of-Thought decoding. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of various architectural and implementation choices on our approach.

<title>Unifying Uniform and Binary-coding Quantization for Accurate Compression of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy? Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely mostly on individual assessments or a single round of pairwise assessments, preventing the judge LLM from developing a global ranking perspective. To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with human scoring.

Abstract: Punctuation plays a vital role in structuring meaning, yet current models often struggle to restore it accurately in transcripts of spontaneous speech, especially in the presence of disfluencies such as false starts and backtracking. These limitations hinder the performance of downstream tasks like translation, text to speech, summarization, etc. where sentence boundaries are critical for preserving quality. In this work, we introduce Cadence, a generalist punctuation restoration model adapted from a pretrained large language model. Cadence is designed to handle both clean written text and highly spontaneous spoken transcripts. It surpasses the previous state of the art in performance while expanding support from 14 to all 22 Indian languages and English. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of model behavior across punctuation types and language families, identifying persistent challenges under domain shift and with rare punctuation marks. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing pretrained language models for multilingual punctuation restoration and highlight Cadence practical value for low resource NLP pipelines at scale.

Abstract: Hausa texts are often characterized by writing anomalies such as incorrect character substitutions and spacing errors, which sometimes hinder natural language processing (NLP) applications. This paper presents an approach to automatically correct the anomalies by finetuning transformer-based models. Using a corpus gathered from several public sources, we created a large-scale parallel dataset of over 450,000 noisy-clean Hausa sentence pairs by introducing synthetically generated noise, fine-tuned to mimic realistic writing errors. Moreover, we adapted several multilingual and African language-focused models, including M2M100, AfriTEVA, mBART, and Opus-MT variants for this correction task using SentencePiece tokenization. Our experimental results demonstrate significant increases in F1, BLEU and METEOR scores, as well as reductions in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER). This research provides a robust methodology, a publicly available dataset, and effective models to improve Hausa text quality, thereby advancing NLP capabilities for the language and offering transferable insights for other low-resource languages.

Abstract: Publication databases rely on accurate metadata extraction from diverse web sources, yet variations in web layouts and data formats present challenges for metadata providers. This paper introduces CRAWLDoc, a new method for contextual ranking of linked web documents. Starting with a publication's URL, such as a digital object identifier, CRAWLDoc retrieves the landing page and all linked web resources, including PDFs, ORCID profiles, and supplementary materials. It embeds these resources, along with anchor texts and the URLs, into a unified representation. For evaluating CRAWLDoc, we have created a new, manually labeled dataset of 600 publications from six top publishers in computer science. Our method CRAWLDoc demonstrates a robust and layout-independent ranking of relevant documents across publishers and data formats. It lays the foundation for improved metadata extraction from web documents with various layouts and formats. Our source code and dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/FKarl/CRAWLDoc.

<title>Multi-objective Aligned Bidword Generation Model for E-commerce Search Advertising</title>

Abstract: Retrieval systems primarily address the challenge of matching user queries with the most relevant advertisements, playing a crucial role in e-commerce search advertising. The diversity of user needs and expressions often produces massive long-tail queries that cannot be matched with merchant bidwords or product titles, which results in some advertisements not being recalled, ultimately harming user experience and search efficiency. Existing query rewriting research focuses on various methods such as query log mining, query-bidword vector matching, or generation-based rewriting. However, these methods often fail to simultaneously optimize the relevance and authenticity of the user's original query and rewrite and maximize the revenue potential of recalled ads.
  In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective aligned Bidword Generation Model (MoBGM), which is composed of a discriminator, generator, and preference alignment module, to address these challenges. To simultaneously improve the relevance and authenticity of the query and rewrite and maximize the platform revenue, we design a discriminator to optimize these key objectives. Using the feedback signal of the discriminator, we train a multi-objective aligned bidword generator that aims to maximize the combined effect of the three objectives. Extensive offline and online experiments show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art. After deployment, the algorithm has created huge commercial value for the platform, further verifying its feasibility and robustness.

Abstract: Pretrained self-supervised speech models excel in speech tasks but do not reflect the hierarchy of human speech processing, as they encode rich semantics in middle layers and poor semantics in late layers. Recent work showed that brain-tuning (fine-tuning models using human brain recordings) improves speech models' semantic understanding. Here, we examine how well brain-tuned models further reflect the brain's intermediate stages of speech processing. We find that late layers of brain-tuned models substantially improve over pretrained models in their alignment with semantic language regions. Further layer-wise probing reveals that early layers remain dedicated to low-level acoustic features, while late layers become the best at complex high-level tasks. These findings show that brain-tuned models not only perform better but also exhibit a well-defined hierarchical processing going from acoustic to semantic representations, making them better model organisms for human speech processing.

Abstract: High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is pivotal in cryptocurrency markets, demanding rapid decision-making. Social media platforms like Reddit offer valuable, yet underexplored, information for such high-frequency, short-term trading. This paper introduces \textbf{PulseReddit}, a novel dataset that is the first to align large-scale Reddit discussion data with high-frequency cryptocurrency market statistics for short-term trading analysis. We conduct an extensive empirical study using Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to investigate the impact of social sentiment from PulseReddit on trading performance. Our experiments conclude that MAS augmented with PulseReddit data achieve superior trading outcomes compared to traditional baselines, particularly in bull markets, and demonstrate robust adaptability across different market regimes. Furthermore, our research provides conclusive insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different LLMs, detailing significant considerations for practical model selection in HFT applications. PulseReddit and our findings establish a foundation for advanced MAS research in HFT, demonstrating the tangible benefits of integrating social media.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly support multiple languages, yet most benchmarks for gender bias remain English-centric. We introduce EuroGEST, a dataset designed to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in LLMs across English and 29 European languages. EuroGEST builds on an existing expert-informed benchmark covering 16 gender stereotypes, expanded in this work using translation tools, quality estimation metrics, and morphological heuristics. Human evaluations confirm that our data generation method results in high accuracy of both translations and gender labels across languages. We use EuroGEST to evaluate 24 multilingual language models from six model families, demonstrating that the strongest stereotypes in all models across all languages are that women are \textit{beautiful,} \textit{empathetic} and \textit{neat} and men are \textit{leaders}, \textit{strong, tough} and \textit{professional}. We also show that larger models encode gendered stereotypes more strongly and that instruction finetuning does not consistently reduce gendered stereotypes. Our work highlights the need for more multilingual studies of fairness in LLMs and offers scalable methods and resources to audit gender bias across languages.

<title>RadialRouter: Structured Representation for Efficient and Robust Large Language Models Routing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically require high-quality studio data and accurate transcriptions for training. India has 1369 languages, with 22 official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.

<title>Pre$^3$: Enabling Deterministic Pushdown Automata for Faster Structured LLM Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive LLM applications demand efficient structured generations, particularly for LR(1) grammars, to produce outputs in specified formats (e.g., JSON). Existing methods primarily parse LR(1) grammars into a pushdown automaton (PDA), leading to runtime execution overhead for context-dependent token processing, especially inefficient under large inference batches. To address these issues, we propose Pre$^3$ that exploits deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA) to optimize the constrained LLM decoding efficiency. First, by precomputing prefix-conditioned edges during the preprocessing, Pre$^3$ enables ahead-of-time edge analysis and thus makes parallel transition processing possible. Second, by leveraging the prefix-conditioned edges, Pre$^3$ introduces a novel approach that transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA, eliminating the need for runtime path exploration and achieving edge transitions with minimal overhead. Pre$^3$ can be seamlessly integrated into standard LLM inference frameworks, reducing time per output token (TPOT) by up to 40% and increasing throughput by up to 36% in our experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/lightllm.

<title>Magic Mushroom: A Customizable Benchmark for Fine-grained Analysis of Retrieval Noise Erosion in RAG Systems</title>

arXiv:2506.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such as hallucination and outdated knowledge.
  However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios.
  Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment.
  In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios.
  Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems.
  Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs.
  More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups.
  We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment.
  Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions.
  Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications.
  The Magic Mushroom benchmark is available at the https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aP5kyPuk4L-L_uoI6T9UhxuTyt8oMqjT/view?usp=sharing.

Abstract: The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis proposes that speakers aim to distribute information evenly throughout a text, balancing production effort and listener comprehension difficulty. However, language typically does not maintain a strictly uniform information rate; instead, it fluctuates around a global average. These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as syntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we explore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced by an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information rate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies simultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension called time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information contours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and Brazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in information rate. Many dominant frequencies align with discourse structure, suggesting these oscillations reflect meaningful linguistic organization. Beyond highlighting the connection between information rate and discourse structure, our approach offers a general framework for uncovering structural pressures at various levels of linguistic granularity.

<title>When Fairness Isn't Statistical: The Limits of Machine Learning in Evaluating Legal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Legal decisions are increasingly evaluated for fairness, consistency, and bias using machine learning (ML) techniques. In high-stakes domains like refugee adjudication, such methods are often applied to detect disparities in outcomes. Yet it remains unclear whether statistical methods can meaningfully assess fairness in legal contexts shaped by discretion, normative complexity, and limited ground truth.
  In this paper, we empirically evaluate three common ML approaches (feature-based analysis, semantic clustering, and predictive modeling) on a large, real-world dataset of 59,000+ Canadian refugee decisions (AsyLex). Our experiments show that these methods produce divergent and sometimes contradictory signals, that predictive modeling often depends on contextual and procedural features rather than legal features, and that semantic clustering fails to capture substantive legal reasoning.
  We show limitations of statistical fairness evaluation, challenge the assumption that statistical regularity equates to fairness, and argue that current computational approaches fall short of evaluating fairness in legally discretionary domains. We argue that evaluating fairness in law requires methods grounded not only in data, but in legal reasoning and institutional context.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech detection is key to online content moderation, but current models struggle to generalise beyond their training data. This has been linked to dataset biases and the use of sentence-level labels, which fail to teach models the underlying structure of hate speech. In this work, we show that even when models are trained with more fine-grained, span-level annotations (e.g., "artists" is labeled as target and "are parasites" as dehumanising comparison), they struggle to disentangle the meaning of these labels from the surrounding context. As a result, combinations of expressions that deviate from those seen during training remain particularly difficult for models to detect. We investigate whether training on a dataset where expressions occur with equal frequency across all contexts can improve generalisation. To this end, we create U-PLEAD, a dataset of ~364,000 synthetic posts, along with a novel compositional generalisation benchmark of ~8,000 manually validated posts. Training on a combination of U-PLEAD and real data improves compositional generalisation while achieving state-of-the-art performance on the human-sourced PLEAD.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias: logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or ``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing term. To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of 300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three LLM families. We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering, systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt. Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies: free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or reintroduce directional drift. Finally, we show that including demographic identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities, highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in LLMs.

Abstract: During a conversation, there can come certain moments where its outcome hangs in the balance. In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such as mental health crisis counseling.
  In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting such pivotal moments as they happen, in an online fashion. Our approach relies on the intuition that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the outcome varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns with human perception -- counselors take significantly longer to respond during moments detected by our method -- and with the eventual conversational trajectory -- which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use our framework to explore the relation of the counselor's response during pivotal moments with the eventual outcome of the session.

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing. However, they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and domain-specific reasoning are crucial. Existing TableQA benchmarks are often limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage. Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications. To address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks. Specifically, TableEval includes tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia, and industry reports). Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. To minimize the risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents. Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level. Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human judgment. Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA tasks, offering insights for future improvements. We make our dataset available here: https://github.com/wenge-research/TableEval.

<title>From Real to Synthetic: Synthesizing Millions of Diversified and Complicated User Instructions with Attributed Grounding</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents. Specifically, we construct a dataset of 1 million instructions, called SynthQuestions, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually scale with more web corpora. Data, models and codes will be available at https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/SynthQuestions.

Abstract: Model pruning in transformer-based language models, traditionally viewed as a means of achieving computational savings, can enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. In this work, we uncover a surprising phenomenon: the selective pruning of certain attention heads leads to improvements in reasoning performance, particularly on challenging tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose SPRINT, a novel contrastive learning framework that dynamically selects the optimal head and layer to prune during inference. By aligning question embeddings with head embeddings, SPRINT identifies those pruned-head configurations that result in more accurate reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional best-of-$N$ and random head selection strategies on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets.

Abstract: Turn-taking management is crucial for any social interaction. Still, it is challenging to model human-machine interaction due to the complexity of the social context and its multimodal nature. Unlike conventional systems based on silence duration, previous existing voice activity projection (VAP) models successfully utilized a unified representation of turn-taking behaviors as prediction targets, which improved turn-taking prediction performance. Recently, a multimodal VAP model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art model by a significant margin. In this paper, we propose a multimodal model enhanced with pre-trained audio and face encoders to improve performance by capturing subtle expressions. Our model performed competitively, and in some cases, even better than state-of-the-art models on turn-taking metrics. All the source codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/sagatake/VAPwithAudioFaceEncoders.

Abstract: Reasoning over time and space is essential for understanding our world. However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks.

Abstract: With the rise of long-context language models (LMs) capable of processing tens of thousands of tokens in a single pass, do multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines still offer measurable benefits over simpler, single-stage approaches? To assess this question, we conduct a controlled evaluation for QA tasks under systematically scaled token budgets, comparing two recent multi-stage pipelines, ReadAgent and RAPTOR, against three baselines, including DOS RAG (Document's Original Structure RAG), a simple retrieve-then-read method that preserves original passage order. Despite its straightforward design, DOS RAG consistently matches or outperforms more intricate methods on multiple long-context QA benchmarks. We recommend establishing DOS RAG as a simple yet strong baseline for future RAG evaluations, pairing it with emerging embedding and language models to assess trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness as model capabilities evolve.

Abstract: Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences of visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective video understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work, we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance. It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves 65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.

Abstract: Social psychologists have shown that Warmth (W) and Competence (C) are the primary dimensions along which we assess other people and groups. These dimensions impact various aspects of our lives from social competence and emotion regulation to success in the work place and how we view the world. More recent work has started to explore how these dimensions develop, why they have developed, and what they constitute. Of particular note, is the finding that warmth has two distinct components: Trust (T) and Sociability (S). In this work, we introduce Words of Warmth, the first large-scale repository of manually derived word--warmth (as well as word--trust and word--sociability) associations for over 26k English words. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicons to study the rate at which children acquire WCTS words with age. Finally, we show that the lexicon enables a wide variety of bias and stereotype research through case studies on various target entities. Words of Warmth is freely available at: http://saifmohammad.com/warmth.html

Abstract: Human learning and conceptual representation is grounded in sensorimotor experience, in contrast to state-of-the-art foundation models. In this paper, we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are classified as "encyclopedic" or "function". These results offer new insights into what can be learned from pure unimodal learning, and the complementarity of the modalities.

Abstract: Review-based Product Question Answering (PQA) allows e-commerce platforms to automatically address customer queries by leveraging insights from user reviews. However, existing PQA systems generate answers with only a single perspective, failing to capture the diversity of customer opinions. In this paper we introduce a novel task Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization (QQSUM), which aims to summarize diverse customer opinions into representative Key Points (KPs) and quantify their prevalence to effectively answer user queries. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for PQA, its generated answers still fall short of capturing the full diversity of viewpoints. To tackle this challenge, our model QQSUM-RAG, which extends RAG, employs few-shot learning to jointly train a KP-oriented retriever and a KP summary generator, enabling KP-based summaries that capture diverse and representative opinions. Experimental results demonstrate that QQSUM-RAG achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art RAG baselines in both textual quality and quantification accuracy of opinions.

Abstract: Background: We present a Patient Simulator that leverages real world patient encounters which cover a broad range of conditions and symptoms to provide synthetic test subjects for development and testing of healthcare agentic models. The simulator provides a realistic approach to patient presentation and multi-turn conversation with a symptom-checking agent. Objectives: (1) To construct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health agent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the validity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient Simulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation framework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven simulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system. Methods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient vignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of presenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance of the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across over 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AI agent to provide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The resulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians. Results: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient vignettes in those same 97.7% of cases. The extracted case summary based on the conversation history was 99% relevant. Conclusions: We developed a methodology to incorporate vignettes derived from real healthcare patient data to build a simulation of patient responses to symptom checking agents. The performance and alignment of this Patient Simulator could be used to train and test a multi-turn conversational AI agent at scale.

Abstract: Mutual exclusivity (ME) is a strategy where a novel word is associated with a novel object rather than a familiar one, facilitating language learning in children. Recent work has found an ME bias in a visually grounded speech (VGS) model trained on English speech with paired images. But ME has also been studied in bilingual children, who may employ it less due to cross-lingual ambiguity. We explore this pattern computationally using bilingual VGS models trained on combinations of English, French, and Dutch. We find that bilingual models generally exhibit a weaker ME bias than monolingual models, though exceptions exist. Analyses show that the combined visual embeddings of bilingual models have a smaller variance for familiar data, partly explaining the increase in confusion between novel and familiar concepts. We also provide new insights into why the ME bias exists in VGS models in the first place. Code and data: https://github.com/danoneata/me-vgs

Abstract: Temporal reasoning in legal texts is important for applications like case law analysis and compliance monitoring. However, existing datasets lack expert language evaluation, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs manage event ordering in legal contexts. We introduce LexTime, the first dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512 instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their temporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal event ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and implicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event pairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge. We investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal language features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific modeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning.

<title>Unveiling and Eliminating the Shortcut Learning for Locate-Then-Edit Knowledge Editing via Both Subject and Relation Awareness</title>

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to alternate the target knowledge predicted by large language models while ensuring the least side effects on unrelated knowledge. An effective way to achieve knowledge editing is to identify pivotal parameters for predicting factual associations and modify them with an optimization process to update the predictions. However, these locate-then-edit methods are uncontrollable since they tend to modify most unrelated relations connected to the subject of target editing. We unveil that this failure of controllable editing is due to a shortcut learning issue during the optimization process. Specifically, we discover two crucial features that are the subject feature and the relation feature for models to learn during optimization, but the current optimization process tends to over-learning the subject feature while neglecting the relation feature. To eliminate this shortcut learning of the subject feature, we propose a novel two-stage optimization process that balances the learning of the subject feature and the relation feature. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully prevents knowledge editing from shortcut learning and achieves the optimal overall performance, contributing to controllable knowledge editing.

Abstract: Automated counter-narratives (CN) offer a promising strategy for mitigating online hate speech, yet concerns about their affective tone, accessibility, and ethical risks remain. We propose a framework for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated CNs across four dimensions: persona framing, verbosity and readability, affective tone, and ethical robustness. Using GPT-4o-Mini, Cohere's CommandR-7B, and Meta's LLaMA 3.1-70B, we assess three prompting strategies on the MT-Conan and HatEval datasets. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated CNs are often verbose and adapted for people with college-level literacy, limiting their accessibility. While emotionally guided prompts yield more empathetic and readable responses, there remain concerns surrounding safety and effectiveness.

The algorithm combines classical \textit{influence functions} to remove the influence of the data from the model and \textit{second-order optimization} to stabilize the overall utility. Our experiments show that this lightweight approach is well applicable for unlearning LLMs in different kinds of task.

Abstract: Language models excel in various tasks by making complex decisions, yet understanding the rationale behind these decisions remains a challenge. This paper investigates \emph{data-centric interpretability} in language models, focusing on the next-word prediction task. Using representer theorem, we identify two types of \emph{support samples}-those that either promote or deter specific predictions. Our findings reveal that being a support sample is an intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally, while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate representation formation.These insights shed light on the interplay between data and model decisions, offering a new dimension to understanding language model behavior and interpretability.

Abstract: Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, yet post-training is constrained by inefficient sample utilization and inflexible difficulty samples processing. To address these limitations, we propose Customized Curriculum Learning (CCL), a novel framework with two key innovations. First, we introduce model-adaptive difficulty definition that customizes curriculum datasets based on each model's individual capabilities rather than using predefined difficulty metrics. Second, we develop "Guided Prompting," which dynamically reduces sample difficulty through strategic hints, enabling effective utilization of challenging samples that would otherwise degrade performance. Comprehensive experiments on supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CCL significantly outperforms uniform training approaches across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness across both paradigms in enhancing sample utilization and model performance.

Abstract: Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals (NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study, hence, focuses on producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate rewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances instruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To facilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced benchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions. Code and benchmark are available at \href{https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/NIG4VI}{https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/NIG4VI}.

Abstract: Practicing conversations with large language models (LLMs) presents a promising alternative to traditional in-person language learning. However, most LLMs generate text at a near-native level of complexity, making them ill-suited for beginner learners (CEFR: A1-A2). In this paper, we investigate whether controllable generation techniques -- specifically modular methods that do not require model fine-tuning -- can adapt LLM outputs to better support absolute beginners. We evaluate these methods through both automatic metrics and a user study with university-level learners of Japanese. Our findings show that while prompting alone fails to control output difficulty, the use of future discriminators (Yang and Klein, 2021) significantly improves output comprehensibility (from 40.4\% to 84.3\%). We further introduce a novel token-level evaluation metric, Token Miss Rate (TMR), that quantifies the proportion of incomprehensible tokens per utterance and correlates strongly with human judgments. To support future research in AI-assisted language learning, we release our code, models, annotation tools, and dataset.

Abstract: Verbatim transcription for automatic speaking assessment demands accurate capture of disfluencies, crucial for downstream tasks like error analysis and feedback. However, many ASR systems discard or generalize hesitations, losing important acoustic details. We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak & Improve 2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations (Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the "Extra" scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the "Pure" scheme (6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling significantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription.

Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

Abstract: Efficient long-sequence generation is a critical challenge for Large Language Models. While recent sparse decoding methods improve efficiency, they suffer from KV cache misalignment, where approximation errors accumulate and degrade generation quality. In this work, we propose Rectified Sparse Attention (ReSA), a simple yet effective method that combines block-sparse attention with periodic dense rectification. By refreshing the KV cache at fixed intervals using a dense forward pass, ReSA bounds error accumulation and preserves alignment with the pretraining distribution. Experiments across math reasoning, language modeling, and retrieval tasks demonstrate that ReSA achieves near-lossless generation quality with significantly improved efficiency. Notably, ReSA delivers up to 2.42$\times$ end-to-end speedup under decoding at 256K sequence length, making it a practical solution for scalable long-context inference. Code is available at https://aka.ms/ReSA-LM.

Abstract: Courtrooms are places where lives are determined and fates are sealed, yet they are not impervious to manipulation. Strategic use of manipulation in legal jargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the growing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing manipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work addresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated courtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of primary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a focus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage, Intent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis by enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and transparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the broader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of robust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Disha1001/CLAIM.

<title>Are Lexicon-Based Tools Still the Gold Standard for Valence Analysis in Low-Resource Flemish?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04139</link>

Abstract: Understanding the nuances in everyday language is pivotal for advancements in computational linguistics & emotions research. Traditional lexicon-based tools such as LIWC and Pattern have long served as foundational instruments in this domain. LIWC is the most extensively validated word count based text analysis tool in the social sciences and Pattern is an open source Python library offering functionalities for NLP. However, everyday language is inherently spontaneous, richly expressive, & deeply context dependent. To explore the capabilities of LLMs in capturing the valences of daily narratives in Flemish, we first conducted a study involving approximately 25,000 textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants. Each participant provided narratives prompted by the question, "What is happening right now and how do you feel about it?", accompanied by self-assessed valence ratings on a continuous scale from -50 to +50. We then assessed the performance of three Dutch-specific LLMs in predicting these valence scores, and compared their outputs to those generated by LIWC and Pattern. Our findings indicate that, despite advancements in LLM architectures, these Dutch tuned models currently fall short in accurately capturing the emotional valence present in spontaneous, real-world narratives. This study underscores the imperative for developing culturally and linguistically tailored models/tools that can adeptly handle the complexities of natural language use. Enhancing automated valence analysis is not only pivotal for advancing computational methodologies but also holds significant promise for psychological research with ecologically valid insights into human daily experiences. We advocate for increased efforts in creating comprehensive datasets & finetuning LLMs for low-resource languages like Flemish, aiming to bridge the gap between computational linguistics & emotion research.

<title>Establishing Trustworthy LLM Evaluation via Shortcut Neuron Analysis</title>

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy. We conduct further experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various benchmarks and hyperparameter settings. Code: https://github.com/GaryStack/Trustworthy-Evaluation

<title>A Dataset for Addressing Patient's Information Needs related to Clinical Course of Hospitalization</title>

Abstract: Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can be addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs). While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs, robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient information needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care unit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and clinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models (LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies: generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system and reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4 achieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and contradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems, underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and relevant responses in clinical contexts.

<title>SkipGPT: Dynamic Layer Pruning Reinvented with Token Awareness and Module Decoupling</title>

arXiv:2506.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across tasks but incur substantial computational costs due to their deep, multi-layered architectures. Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these inefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical dynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level heterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical dynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers necessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a dynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource allocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to prioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and self-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a two-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that learns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning decisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore performance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the performance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing dynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical deployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/EIT-NLP/SkipGPT.

Abstract: Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical consistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To address these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based framework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text generation. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through planning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model to follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a professional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised fine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize each generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating structured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.

<title>Long or short CoT? Investigating Instance-level Switch of Large Reasoning Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large reasoning models, long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance on complex tasks. However, this often comes with a significant increase in token usage. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis comparing long and short CoT strategies. Our findings reveal that while long CoT can lead to performance improvements, its benefits are often marginal relative to its significantly higher token consumption. Specifically, long CoT tends to outperform when ample generation budgets are available, whereas short CoT is more effective under tighter budget constraints. These insights underscore the need for a dynamic approach that selects the proper CoT strategy based on task context and resource availability. To address this, we propose SwitchCoT, an automatic framework that adaptively chooses between long and short CoT strategies to balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, SwitchCoT is designed to be budget-aware, making it broadly applicable across scenarios with varying resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchCoT can reduce inference costs by up to 50% while maintaining high accuracy. Notably, under limited token budgets, it achieves performance comparable to, or even exceeding, that of using either long or short CoT alone.

arXiv:2506.04185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have notably progressed in multi-step and long-chain reasoning. However, extending their reasoning capabilities to encompass deep interactions with search remains a non-trivial challenge, as models often fail to identify optimal reasoning-search interaction trajectories, resulting in suboptimal responses. We propose R-Search, a novel reinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to enable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search interaction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via multi-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and knowledge-intensive tasks. R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when to retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep knowledge interaction between reasoning and search. During RL training, R-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the reasoning-search trajectory. Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search outperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1% (out-of-domain). The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingFei1/R-Search.

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a "precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

Abstract: Finetuning is a critical step for adapting large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific downstream tasks. To mitigate the substantial computational and memory costs of full-model fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed to update only a small subset of model parameters. However, performance gaps between PEFT approaches and full-model fine-tuning still exist. In this work, we present DiaBlo, a simple yet effective PEFT approach that updates only the diagonal blocks of selected model weight matrices. Unlike Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, DiaBlo eliminates the need for low rank matrix products, thereby avoiding the reliance on auxiliary initialization schemes or customized optimization strategies to improve convergence. This design leads to stable and robust convergence while maintaining comparable memory efficiency and training speed to LoRA. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment, to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of DiaBlo. Across these benchmarks, DiaBlo demonstrates strong and consistent performance while maintaining high memory efficiency and fast finetuning speed. Codes are available at https://github.com/ziyangjoy/DiaBlo.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a few demonstrations provided in the prompt. Despite its success, ICL suffers from several limitations, including sensitivity to demonstration order, context length constraints, and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, task vector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector. However, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of demonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the specific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective adaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying demonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors (ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors conditioned on each input query. ATV employs a small language model to generate task vectors, which are then transformed to match the target LLM's architecture and applied to guide its output generation. In contrast to ICL and previous vector-based approaches, which rely on fixed demonstration sets and their corresponding vectors, ATV dynamically generates task vectors tailored to each specific input query and task. Consequently, ATV demonstrates strong performance and generalization capabilities, even for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis indicating that ATV is expressively equivalent to LoRA under equal rank budgets and more expressive than Prefix-Tuning, thereby offering formal support for its representational advantage.

<title>Exploiting LLMs for Automatic Hypothesis Assessment via a Logit-Based Calibrated Prior</title>

Abstract: As hypothesis generation becomes increasingly automated, a new bottleneck has emerged: hypothesis assessment. Modern systems can surface thousands of statistical relationships-correlations, trends, causal links-but offer little guidance on which ones are novel, non-trivial, or worthy of expert attention. In this work, we study the complementary problem to hypothesis generation: automatic hypothesis assessment. Specifically, we ask: given a large set of statistical relationships, can we automatically assess which ones are novel and worth further exploration? We focus on correlations as they are a common entry point in exploratory data analysis that often serve as the basis for forming deeper scientific or causal hypotheses.
  To support automatic assessment, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge encoded in LLMs' weights to derive a prior distribution over the correlation value of a variable pair. If an LLM's prior expects the correlation value observed, then such correlation is not surprising, and vice versa. We propose the Logit-based Calibrated Prior, an LLM-elicited correlation prior that transforms the model's raw output logits into a calibrated, continuous predictive distribution over correlation values. We evaluate the prior on a benchmark of 2,096 real-world variable pairs and it achieves a sign accuracy of 78.8%, a mean absolute error of 0.26, and 95% credible interval coverage of 89.2% in predicting Pearson correlation coefficient. It also outperforms a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier in binary correlation prediction and achieves higher precision@K in hypothesis ranking. We further show that the prior generalizes to correlations not seen during LLM pretraining, reflecting context-sensitive reasoning rather than memorization.

<title>ProRank: Prompt Warmup via Reinforcement Learning for Small Language Models Reranking</title>

Abstract: Reranking is fundamental to information retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation, with recent Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly advancing reranking quality. While recent advances with LLMs have significantly improved document reranking quality, current approaches primarily rely on large-scale LLMs (>7B parameters) through zero-shot prompting, presenting high computational costs. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising alternative because of their efficiency, but our preliminary quantitative analysis reveals they struggle with understanding task prompts without fine-tuning. This limits their effectiveness for document reranking tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage training approach, ProRank, for SLM-based document reranking. First, we propose a prompt warmup stage using reinforcement learning GRPO to steer SLMs to understand task prompts and generate more accurate coarse-grained binary relevance scores for document reranking. Then, we continuously fine-tune the SLMs with a fine-grained score learning stage without introducing additional layers to further improve the reranking quality. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ProRank consistently outperforms both the most advanced open-source and proprietary reranking models. Notably, our lightweight ProRank-0.5B model even surpasses the powerful 32B LLM reranking model on the BEIR benchmark, establishing that properly trained SLMs can achieve superior document reranking performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

Abstract: This study explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tone recognition in three low-resource languages from North Eastern India: Angami, Ao, and Mizo. We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition, regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings.

<title>VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches</title>

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at https://github.com/ZHZisZZ/visual-stitching.

Abstract: We introduce PromptCanvas, a concept that transforms prompting into a composable, widget-based experience on an infinite canvas. Users can generate, customize, and arrange interactive widgets representing various facets of their text, offering greater control over AI-generated content. PromptCanvas allows widget creation through system suggestions, user prompts, or manual input, providing a flexible environment tailored to individual needs. This enables deeper engagement with the creative process. In a lab study with 18 participants, PromptCanvas outperformed a traditional conversational UI on the Creativity Support Index. Participants found that it reduced cognitive load, with lower mental demand and frustration. Qualitative feedback revealed that the visual organization of thoughts and easy iteration encouraged new perspectives and ideas. A follow-up field study (N=10) confirmed these results, showcasing the potential of dynamic, customizable interfaces in improving collaborative writing with AI.

<title>Prompt Candidates, then Distill: A Teacher-Student Framework for LLM-driven Data Annotation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03857</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations. Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/gjq100/Graph-Counselor.git.

<title>AgentMisalignment: Measuring the Propensity for Misaligned Behaviour in LLM-Based Agents</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

<title>CETBench: A Novel Dataset constructed via Transformations over Programs for Benchmarking LLMs for Code-Equivalence Checking</title>

Abstract: LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on MM-HalBench.

Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability. Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo} achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across multiple datasets.

Abstract: As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of ambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available at https://github.com/cog-model/AmbiK-dataset.

Abstract: The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame. (2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only 52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies (Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains. We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers in the field of natural language processing has sparked the interest of the speech-processing community, leading to an exploration of their potential for modeling long-range dependencies within speech sequences. Recently, transformers have gained prominence across various speech-related domains, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, speech para-linguistics, speech enhancement, spoken dialogue systems, and numerous multimodal applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that aims to bridge research studies from diverse subfields within speech technology. By consolidating findings from across the speech technology landscape, we provide a valuable resource for researchers interested in harnessing the power of transformers to advance the field. We identify the challenges encountered by transformers in speech processing while also offering insights into potential solutions to address these issues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration highlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in achieving exceptional math performance.

Abstract: Existing text scoring methods require a large corpus, struggle with short texts, or require hand-labeled data. We develop a text scoring framework that leverages generative large language models (LLMs) to (1) set texts against the backdrop of information from the near-totality of the web and digitized media, and (2) effectively transform pairwise text comparisons from a reasoning problem to a pattern recognition task. Our approach, concept-guided chain-of-thought (CGCoT), utilizes a chain of researcher-designed prompts with an LLM to generate a concept-specific breakdown for each text, akin to guidance provided to human coders. We then pairwise compare breakdowns using an LLM and aggregate answers into a score using a probability model. We apply this approach to better understand speech reflecting aversion to specific political parties on Twitter, a topic that has commanded increasing interest because of its potential contributions to democratic backsliding. We achieve stronger correlations with human judgments than widely used unsupervised text scoring methods like Wordfish. In a supervised setting, besides a small pilot dataset to develop CGCoT prompts, our measures require no additional hand-labeled data and produce predictions on par with RoBERTa-Large fine-tuned on thousands of hand-labeled tweets. This project showcases the potential of combining human expertise and LLMs for scoring tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming a wide range of domains, yet verifying their outputs remains a significant challenge, especially for complex open-ended tasks such as consolidation, summarization, and knowledge extraction. To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable, and accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single embedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like SFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied on weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence granularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons directly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy and scalability. We conduct a comprehensive design and time complexity analysis across 13 verification baselines, including classical text scorers (e.g., BLEU), stability-based methods (e.g., SelfCheckGPT), and generative evaluators (e.g., LLM-as-a-Judge), which highlights the effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and simplicity of CE. Empirical results show that CE reliably detects hallucinations in both closed and open-ended tasks. We further present evidence that CE generalizes beyond text to other modalities such as vision, establishing it as a practical and versatile verification framework.

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is essential for determining their effectiveness as helpful assistants. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on basic abilities using nonverbal methods, such as yes-no and multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing AlignMMBench, which provides more nuanced evaluations of alignment capabilities and is the first benchmark specifically designed for Chinese visual contexts. This benchmark is meticulously curated from real-world scenarios and internet sources, encompassing thirteen specific tasks across three categories, and includes both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Incorporating a prompt rewrite strategy, AlignMMBench encompasses 1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs. To facilitate the evaluation pipeline, we develop CritiqueVLM, a rule-calibrated evaluator that exceeds GPT-4's evaluation ability. Additionally, we measure the "alignment score", a quantitative metric designed to assess the robustness and stability of models across diverse prompts. Finally, we evaluate the performance of representative VLMs on AlignMMBench, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of different VLM architectures. The evaluation code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/AlignMMBench.

<title>UBench: Benchmarking Uncertainty in Large Language Models with Multiple Choice Questions</title>

Abstract: Despite recent progress in systematic evaluation frameworks, benchmarking the uncertainty of large language models (LLMs) remains a highly challenging task. Existing methods for benchmarking the uncertainty of LLMs face three key challenges: the need for internal model access, additional training, or high computational costs. This is particularly unfavorable for closed-source models. To this end, we introduce UBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the uncertainty of LLMs. Unlike other benchmarks, UBench is based on confidence intervals. It encompasses 11,978 multiple-choice questions spanning knowledge, language, understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Based on this, we conduct extensive experiments. This includes comparisons with other advanced uncertainty estimation methods, the assessment of the uncertainty of 20 LLMs, and an exploration of the effects of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, role-playing (RP) prompts, and temperature on model uncertainty. Our analysis reveals several crucial insights: 1) Our confidence interval-based methods are highly effective for uncertainty quantification; 2) Regarding uncertainty, outstanding open-source models show competitive performance versus closed-source models; 3) CoT and RP prompts present potential ways to improve model reliability, while the influence of temperature changes follows no universal rule. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Cyno2232/UBENCH.

<title>UIO-LLMs: Unbiased Incremental Optimization for Long-Context LLMs</title>

Abstract: Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human annotation. The response pair annotation process might bring human bias. Building a correct preference dataset is the costly part of the alignment pipeline. To improve annotation efficiency and quality in the LLMs alignment, we propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the less ambiguous preference pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on the similarity of embedding responses independently of prompts, which guarantees the selection process in an off-policy setting, avoiding adaptively measuring the similarity during the training. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned with dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error and improve LLM alignment efficiency, saving up to $65\%$ of annotators' work.

<title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>

Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7x-14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, NUDGING enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-27b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment. Our code and demo are available at: https://fywalter.github.io/nudging/ .

<title>RULEBREAKERS: Challenging LLMs at the Crossroads between Formal Logic and Human-like Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Formal logic enables computers to reason in natural language by representing sentences in symbolic forms and applying rules to derive conclusions. However, in what our study characterizes as "rulebreaker" scenarios, this method can lead to conclusions that are typically not inferred or accepted by humans given their common sense and factual knowledge. Inspired by works in cognitive science, we create RULEBREAKERS, the first dataset for rigorously evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize and respond to rulebreakers (versus non-rulebreakers) in a human-like manner. Evaluating seven LLMs, we find that most models, including GPT-4o, achieve mediocre accuracy on RULEBREAKERS and exhibit some tendency to over-rigidly apply logical rules unlike what is expected from typical human reasoners. Further analysis suggests that this apparent failure is potentially associated with the models' poor utilization of their world knowledge and their attention distribution patterns. Whilst revealing a limitation of current LLMs, our study also provides a timely counterbalance to a growing body of recent works that propose methods relying on formal logic to improve LLMs' general reasoning capabilities, highlighting their risk of further increasing divergence between LLMs and human-like reasoning.

<title>DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions</title>

arXiv:2411.01747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases. Our code can be found in https://github.com/adobe-research/dynasaur.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since Petroni et al. (2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an ``availability bias'' (Tversky&amp;Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs).
  As a prototype, we build GPTKB, a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from GPT-4o-mini. We use GPTKB to exemplarily analyze GPT-4o-mini's factual knowledge in terms of scale, accuracy, bias, cutoff and consistency, at the same time. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org

Abstract: Radiology reports are often lengthy and unstructured, posing challenges for referring physicians to quickly identify critical imaging findings while increasing the risk of missed information. This retrospective study aimed to enhance radiology reports by making them concise and well-structured, with findings organized by relevant organs. To achieve this, we utilized private large language models (LLMs) deployed locally within our institution's firewall, ensuring data security and minimizing computational costs. Using a dataset of 814 radiology reports from seven board-certified body radiologists at Moffitt Cancer Center, we tested five prompting strategies within the LangChain framework. After evaluating several models, the Mixtral LLM demonstrated superior adherence to formatting requirements compared to alternatives like Llama. The optimal strategy involved condensing reports first and then applying structured formatting based on specific instructions, reducing verbosity while improving clarity. Across all radiologists and reports, the Mixtral LLM reduced redundant word counts by more than 53%. These findings highlight the potential of locally deployed, open-source LLMs to streamline radiology reporting. By generating concise, well-structured reports, these models enhance information retrieval and better meet the needs of referring physicians, ultimately improving clinical workflows.

Abstract: In an effort to mitigate the harms of large language models (LLMs), learning from human feedback (LHF) has been used to steer LLMs towards outputs that are intended to be both less harmful and more helpful. Despite the widespread adoption of LHF in practice, the quality of this feedback and its effectiveness as a safety mitigation technique remain unclear. This study addresses these issues by auditing the widely-used Helpful and Harmless (HH) dataset by Anthropic. Our work includes: (1) a thorough investigation of the dataset's content through both manual and automated evaluation; (2) experiments demonstrating the dataset's impact on models' safety; and (3) an analysis of the 100 most influential papers citing this dataset. Through our audit, we showcase how conceptualization failures and quality issues identified in the HH dataset can create additional harms by leading to disparate safety behaviors across demographic groups. Our findings highlight the need for more nuanced, context-sensitive approaches to safety mitigation in LLMs.

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has emerged as a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP), aimed at automatically detecting causal relationships between events in text. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.

Abstract: Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of key components, such as rewriting and self-filtering, in the dataset construction process.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that knowledge distillation can be subverted to manipulate language model benchmark scores, revealing a critical vulnerability in current evaluation practices. We introduce "Data Laundering," a process that enables the covert transfer of benchmark-specific knowledge through seemingly legitimate intermediate training steps. Through extensive experiments with a 2-layer BERT student model, we show how this approach can achieve substantial improvements in benchmark accuracy (up to 75\% on GPQA) without developing genuine reasoning capabilities. Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method and inflate scores without realising the implications. While our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present them as a cautionary tale highlighting the urgent need for more robust evaluation methods in AI. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion about evaluation integrity in AI development and the need for benchmarks that more accurately reflect true model capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While this approach has proven effective, it inevitably increases substantial inference costs. Previous methods adopting token-level reduction without clear criteria result in poor performance compared to models trained with complete rationale. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction framework leveraging likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches, our method leverages verbosity to selectively remove redundant reasoning sentences while preserving reasoning capabilities. Our experimental results across various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method improves performance by an average of 7.71% while reducing token generation by 19.87% compared to model trained with complete reasoning paths.

Abstract: Concept-based explanations work by mapping complex model computations to human-understandable concepts. Evaluating such explanations is very difficult, as it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts but also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users. Existing evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the latter. We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations via automated simulatability: a simulator's ability to predict the explained model's outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for both the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation. Human studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact, particularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which is the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as simulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make such approximations reliable. Our method allows for scalable and consistent evaluation across various models and datasets. We report a comprehensive empirical evaluation using this framework and show that LLMs provide consistent rankings of explanation methods. Code available at https://github.com/AnonymousConSim/ConSim.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements but also raise concerns about cultural bias, often reflecting dominant narratives at the expense of under-represented subcultures. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to recognize and accurately respond to the Little Traditions within Indian society, encompassing localized cultural practices and subcultures such as caste, kinship, marriage, and religion. Through a series of case studies, we assess whether LLMs can balance the interplay between dominant Great Traditions and localized Little Traditions. We explore various prompting strategies and further investigate whether using prompts in regional languages enhances the models cultural sensitivity and response quality. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate an ability to articulate cultural nuances, they often struggle to apply this understanding in practical, context-specific scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze LLMs engagement with Indian subcultures, offering critical insights into the challenges of embedding cultural diversity in AI systems.

Abstract: We present ReFoRCE, a Text-to-SQL agent that tops the Spider 2.0 leaderboard--a challenging benchmark reflecting complex, real-world Text-to-SQL scenarios. While Text-to-SQL systems enable natural language queries over structured databases, deploying them in enterprise environments remains difficult due to large, complex schemas (with over 1,000 columns), diverse SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and sophisticated query requirements (e.g., transformations and analytics). ReFoRCE addresses these challenges through: (a) database information compression via pattern-based table grouping and LLM-guided schema linking to alleviate long-context issues; (b) self-refinement to iteratively correct syntax and semantic errors across dialects; (c) majority-vote consensus to select high-confidence candidates while deferring ambiguous cases arising from sophisticated queries; and (d) iterative column exploration guided by execution feedback to resolve those deferred cases. ReFoRCE achieves new state-of-the-art results, with scores of 35.83 on Spider 2.0-Snow and 36.56 on Spider 2.0-Lite.

<title>Refining Sentence Embedding Model through Ranking Sentences Generation with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Sentence embedding is essential for many NLP tasks, with contrastive learning methods achieving strong performance using annotated datasets like NLI. Yet, the reliance on manual labels limits scalability. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sentence pairs, reducing annotation dependency. However, they overlook ranking information crucial for fine-grained semantic distinctions. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method for controlling the generation direction of LLMs in the latent space. Unlike unconstrained generation, the controlled approach ensures meaningful semantic divergence. Then, we refine exist sentence embedding model by integrating ranking information and semantic information. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves new SOTA performance with a modest cost in ranking sentence synthesis.

<title>Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region</title>

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.

Abstract: As text generation systems' outputs are increasingly anthropomorphic -- perceived as human-like -- scholars have also increasingly raised concerns about how such outputs can lead to harmful outcomes, such as users over-relying or developing emotional dependence on these systems. How to intervene on such system outputs to mitigate anthropomorphic behaviors and their attendant harmful outcomes, however, remains understudied. With this work, we aim to provide empirical and theoretical grounding for developing such interventions. To do so, we compile an inventory of interventions grounded both in prior literature and a crowdsourcing study where participants edited system outputs to make them less human-like. Drawing on this inventory, we also develop a conceptual framework to help characterize the landscape of possible interventions, articulate distinctions between different types of interventions, and provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions.

Abstract: A common use of NLP is to facilitate the understanding of large document collections, with a shift from using traditional topic models to Large Language Models. Yet the effectiveness of using LLM for large corpus understanding in real-world applications remains under-explored. This study measures the knowledge users acquire with unsupervised, supervised LLM-based exploratory approaches or traditional topic models on two datasets. While LLM-based methods generate more human-readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents. Adding human supervision to the LLM generation process improves data exploration by mitigating hallucination and over-genericity but requires greater human effort. In contrast, traditional. models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly. We show that LLMs struggle to describe the haystack of large corpora without human help, particularly domain-specific data, and face scaling and hallucination limitations due to context length constraints.

Abstract: In electronic design, engineers often manually search through extensive documents to retrieve component parameters required for constructing SPICE models, a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present an automated framework called D2S-FLOW that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract electrical parameters from datasheets and generate SPICE models with high precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. Unlike traditional RAG systems, D2S-FLOW employs a workflow to enhance precision in handling unstructured documents and inconsistent naming conventions through three innovative mechanisms: Attention-Guided Document Focusing (AGDF), Hierarchical Document-Enhanced Retrieval (HDER), and Heterogeneous Named Entity Normalization (HNEN). AGDF narrows retrieval to user-selected documents, HDER utilizes document structure for precise parameter localization, and HNEN standardizes terminology via semantic inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves an Exact Match (EM) of 0.86, an F1 score of 0.92, and an Exact Correctness (EC) of 0.96, outperforming the strongest baseline by 19.4%, 5.7%, and 13.1%, respectively. Additionally, it reduces API token consumption by 38% and minimizes the irrelevant information ratio to 4%, showcasing substantial improvements in resource efficiency. This research provides an effective automated solution for circuit design.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their quadratic computational complexity concerning sequence length remains a significant bottleneck for processing long documents. As a result, many efforts like sparse attention and state space models have been proposed to improve the efficiency of LLMs over long sequences. Though effective, these approaches compromise the performance or introduce structural complexity. This calls for a simple yet efficient model that preserves the fundamental Transformer architecture. To this end, we introduce SWAT, which enables efficient long-context handling via Sliding Window Attention Training. This paper first attributes the inefficiency of Transformers to the attention sink phenomenon resulting from the high variance of softmax operation. Then, we replace softmax with the sigmoid function and utilize a balanced ALiBi and Rotary Position Embedding for efficient information compression and retention. Experiments demonstrate that SWAT achieves SOTA performance compared with state-of-the-art linear recurrent architectures on eight benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Fzkuji/swat-attention.

Abstract: Africa's rich linguistic heritage remains underrepresented in NLP, largely due to historical policies that favor foreign languages and create significant data inequities. In this paper, we integrate theoretical insights on Africa's language landscape with an empirical evaluation using Sahara - a comprehensive benchmark curated from large-scale, publicly accessible datasets capturing the continent's linguistic diversity. By systematically assessing the performance of leading large language models (LLMs) on Sahara, we demonstrate how policy-induced data variations directly impact model effectiveness across African languages. Our findings reveal that while a few languages perform reasonably well, many Indigenous languages remain marginalized due to sparse data. Leveraging these insights, we offer actionable recommendations for policy reforms and inclusive data practices. Overall, our work underscores the urgent need for a dual approach - combining theoretical understanding with empirical evaluation - to foster linguistic diversity in AI for African communities.

Abstract: Recent work found that LLMs are sensitive to a wide range of arbitrary prompt dimensions, including the type of delimiters, answer enumerators, instruction wording, and more. This throws into question popular single-prompt evaluation practices. We present DOVE (Dataset Of Variation Evaluation) a large-scale dataset containing prompt perturbations of various evaluation benchmarks. In contrast to previous work, we examine LLM sensitivity from an holistic perspective, and assess the joint effects of perturbations along various dimensions, resulting in thousands of perturbations per instance. We evaluate several model families against DOVE, leading to several findings, including efficient methods for choosing well-performing prompts, observing that few-shot examples reduce sensitivity, and identifying instances which are inherently hard across all perturbations. DOVE consists of more than 250M prompt perturbations and model outputs, which we make publicly available to spur a community-wide effort toward meaningful, robust, and efficient evaluation.

Abstract: Crosslingual transfer is crucial to contemporary language models' multilingual capabilities, but how it occurs is not well understood. We ask what happens to a monolingual language model when it begins to be trained on a second language. Specifically, we train small bilingual models for which we control the amount of data for each language and the order of language exposure. To find evidence of shared multilingual representations, we turn to structural priming, a method used to study grammatical representations in humans. We first replicate previous crosslingual structural priming results and find that after controlling for training data quantity and language exposure, there are asymmetrical effects across language pairs and directions. We argue that this asymmetry may shape hypotheses about human structural priming effects. We also find that structural priming effects are less robust for less similar language pairs, highlighting potential limitations of crosslingual transfer learning and shared representations for typologically diverse languages.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue modeling poses challenges beyond text-based language modeling, requiring real-time interaction, turn-taking, and backchanneling. While most Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) operate in half-duplex mode-processing one turn at a time - emerging full-duplex SDMs can listen and speak simultaneously, enabling more natural conversations. However, current evaluations remain limited, focusing mainly on turn-based metrics or coarse corpus-level analyses. To address this, we introduce Full-Duplex-Bench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates key interactive behaviors: pause handling, backchanneling, turn-taking, and interruption management. Our framework uses automatic metrics for consistent, reproducible assessment and provides a fair, fast evaluation setup. By releasing our benchmark and code, we aim to advance spoken dialogue modeling and foster the development of more natural and engaging SDMs.

Abstract: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling decision and sequential branches. The data is released in https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/PFDial.

Abstract: Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) provides insight into cultural and social dynamics. Yet, the validity of methods for measuring different kinds of LSC remains unestablished due to the absence of historical benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we propose LSC-Eval, a novel three-stage general-purpose evaluation framework to: (1) develop a scalable methodology for generating synthetic datasets that simulate theory-driven LSC using In-Context Learning and a lexical database; (2) use these datasets to evaluate the sensitivity of computational methods to synthetic change; and (3) assess their suitability for detecting change in specific dimensions and domains. We apply LSC-Eval to simulate changes along the Sentiment, Intensity, and Breadth (SIB) dimensions, as defined in the SIBling framework, using examples from psychology. We then evaluate the ability of selected methods to detect these controlled interventions. Our findings validate the use of synthetic benchmarks, demonstrate that tailored methods effectively detect changes along SIB dimensions, and reveal that a state-of-the-art LSC model faces challenges in detecting affective dimensions of LSC. LSC-Eval offers a valuable tool for dimension- and domain-specific benchmarking of LSC methods, with particular relevance to the social sciences.

Abstract: Discourse understanding is essential for many NLP tasks, yet most existing work remains constrained by framework-dependent discourse representations. This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our error analysis provides an account of challenging relation classes.

Abstract: Idiomatic expressions present a unique challenge in NLP, as their meanings are often not directly inferable from their constituent words. Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), idiomaticity remains a significant obstacle to robust semantic representation. We present datasets and tasks for SemEval-2025 Task 1: AdMiRe (Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation), which challenges the community to assess and improve models' ability to interpret idiomatic expressions in multimodal contexts and in multiple languages. Participants competed in two subtasks: ranking images based on their alignment with idiomatic or literal meanings, and predicting the next image in a sequence. The most effective methods achieved human-level performance by leveraging pretrained LLMs and vision-language models in mixture-of-experts settings, with multiple queries used to smooth over the weaknesses in these models' representations of idiomaticity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation, reasoning, and decision-making, enabling their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and transportation. However, their reliability is a major concern, as they often produce plausible but incorrect responses. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) enhances trustworthiness by estimating confidence in outputs, enabling risk mitigation and selective prediction. However, traditional UQ methods struggle with LLMs due to computational constraints and decoding inconsistencies. Moreover, LLMs introduce unique uncertainty sources, such as input ambiguity, reasoning path divergence, and decoding stochasticity, that extend beyond classical aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address this, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes UQ methods based on computational efficiency and uncertainty dimensions (input, reasoning, parameter, and prediction uncertainty). We evaluate existing techniques, assess their real-world applicability, and identify open challenges, emphasizing the need for scalable, interpretable, and robust UQ approaches to enhance LLM reliability.

By tracking key item statuses and generating episode summaries, SCORE uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, incorporating TF-IDF and cosine similarity to identify related episodes and enhance the overall story structure. Results from testing multiple LLM-generated stories demonstrate that SCORE significantly improves the consistency and stability of narrative coherence compared to baseline GPT models, providing a more robust method for evaluating and refining AI-generated narratives.

Abstract: The performance and usability of Large-Language Models (LLMs) are driving their use in explanation generation tasks. However, despite their widespread adoption, LLM explanations have been found to be unreliable, making it difficult for users to distinguish good from bad explanations. To address this issue, we present Rubrik's CUBE, an education-inspired rubric and a dataset of 26k explanations, written and later quality-annotated using the rubric by both humans and six open- and closed-source LLMs. The CUBE dataset focuses on two reasoning and two language tasks, providing the necessary diversity for us to effectively test our proposed rubric. Using Rubrik, we find that explanations are influenced by both task and perceived difficulty. Low quality stems primarily from a lack of conciseness in LLM-generated explanations, rather than cohesion and word choice. The full dataset, rubric, and code are available at https://github.com/RubriksCube/rubriks_cube.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are typically tuned with human preferences to produce helpful responses, but the impact of preference tuning on the ability to handle culturally diverse queries remains understudied. In this paper, we systematically analyze how native human cultural preferences can be incorporated into the preference learning process to train more culturally aware LMs. We introduce \textbf{CARE}, a multilingual resource containing 3,490 culturally specific questions and 31.7k responses with native judgments. We demonstrate how a modest amount of high-quality native preferences improves cultural awareness across various LMs, outperforming larger generic preference data. Our analyses reveal that models with stronger initial cultural performance benefit more from alignment, leading to gaps among models developed in different regions with varying access to culturally relevant data. CARE will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Guochry/CARE.

Abstract: Short answer assessment is a vital component of science education, allowing evaluation of students' complex three-dimensional understanding. Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains.

Abstract: Peer review is central to academic publishing, but the growing volume of submissions is straining the process. This motivates the development of computational approaches to support peer review. While each review is tailored to a specific paper, reviewers often make assessments according to certain aspects such as Novelty, which reflect the values of the research community. This alignment creates opportunities for standardizing the reviewing process, improving quality control, and enabling computational support. While prior work has demonstrated the potential of aspect analysis for peer review assistance, the notion of aspect remains poorly formalized. Existing approaches often derive aspects from review forms and guidelines, yet data-driven methods for aspect identification are underexplored. To address this gap, our work takes a bottom-up approach: we propose an operational definition of aspect and develop a data-driven schema for deriving aspects from a corpus of peer reviews. We introduce a dataset of peer reviews augmented with aspects and show how it can be used for community-level review analysis. We further show how the choice of aspects can impact downstream applications, such as LLM-generated review detection. Our results lay a foundation for a principled and data-driven investigation of review aspects, and pave the path for new applications of NLP to support peer review.

<title>Revisiting Uncertainty Quantification Evaluation in Language Models: Spurious Interactions with Response Length Bias Results</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is key to improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). We show that mutual biases--when both UQ methods and correctness functions are biased by the same factors--systematically distort evaluation. First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely used correctness functions, from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LM-as-a-judge approaches, across 4 datasets x 4 models x 8 UQ methods. Our analysis shows that length biases in correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LM-as-a-judge methods as the least length-biased, offering a promising path for a fairer UQ evaluation.

<title>Hypothetical Documents or Knowledge Leakage? Rethinking LLM-based Query Expansion</title>

Abstract: Query expansion methods powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in zero-shot retrieval tasks. These methods assume that LLMs can generate hypothetical documents that, when incorporated into a query vector, enhance the retrieval of real evidence. However, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether knowledge leakage in benchmarks contributes to the observed performance gains. Using fact verification as a testbed, we analyze whether the generated documents contain information entailed by ground-truth evidence and assess their impact on performance. Our findings indicate that, on average, performance improvements consistently occurred for claims whose generated documents included sentences entailed by gold evidence. This suggests that knowledge leakage may be present in fact-verification benchmarks, potentially inflating the perceived performance of LLM-based query expansion methods.

Abstract: The composition of pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) remains largely undisclosed, hindering transparency and efforts to optimize data quality, a critical driver of model performance. Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater,a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23, with advantages that scale to models as large as 7.2B parameters. Our work establishes that holistic, multi-dimensional quality integration significantly outperforms conventional single-dimension approaches, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing pre-training efficiency and model capability. To advance future research, we release scripts, data, and models at https://github.com/opendatalab/Meta-rater.

<title>Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?</title>

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps. Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.

<title>T$^2$: An Adaptive Test-Time Scaling Strategy for Contextual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity. T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead by up to 25.2\%.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Liuz233/AGDe-Judge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.

Abstract: Steerability, or the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt outputs to align with diverse community-specific norms, perspectives, and communication styles, is critical for real-world applications but remains under-evaluated. We introduce Steer-Bench, a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering using contrasting Reddit communities. Covering 30 contrasting subreddit pairs across 19 domains, Steer-Bench includes over 10,000 instruction-response pairs and validated 5,500 multiple-choice question with corresponding silver labels to test alignment with diverse community norms. Our evaluation of 13 popular LLMs using Steer-Bench reveals that while human experts achieve an accuracy of 81% with silver labels, the best-performing models reach only around 65% accuracy depending on the domain and configuration. Some models lag behind human-level alignment by over 15 percentage points, highlighting significant gaps in community-sensitive steerability. Steer-Bench is a benchmark to systematically assess how effectively LLMs understand community-specific instructions, their resilience to adversarial steering attempts, and their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/jiyounglee-0523/TransEnV and https://huggingface.co/collections/jiyounglee0523/transenv-681eadb3c0c8cf363b363fb1.

<title>LLMs Think, But Not In Your Flow: Reasoning-Level Personalization for Black-Box Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks and are now widely used in real-world applications. Among them, black-box LLMs--served via APIs without access to model internals--are especially dominant due to their scalability and ease of deployment. Despite their strong capabilities, these models typically produce generalized responses that overlook personal preferences and reasoning styles. This has led to growing interest in black-box LLM personalization, which aims to tailor model outputs to user-specific context without modifying model parameters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on response-level personalization, attempting to match final outputs without modeling personal thought process. To address this limitation, we propose RPM, a framework for reasoning-level personalization that aligns the model's reasoning process with a user's personalized logic. RPM first constructs statistical user-specific factors by extracting and grouping response-influential features from user history. It then builds personalized reasoning paths that reflect how these factors are used in context. In the inference stage, RPM retrieves reasoning-aligned examples for new queries via feature-level similarity and performs inference conditioned on the structured factors and retrieved reasoning paths, enabling the model to follow user-specific reasoning trajectories. This reasoning-level personalization enhances both predictive accuracy and interpretability by grounding model outputs in user-specific logic through structured information. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks show that RPM consistently outperforms response-level personalization methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-level personalization in black-box LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for information integrity across critical domains, including education, social media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns, compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies (generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement) across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic, and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs, with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\% F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

Experiments demonstrate superior correctness with minimal computation, making it a scalable, model-agnostic solution.

Abstract: Guardrail, an emerging mechanism designed to ensure that large language models (LLMs) align with human values by moderating harmful or toxic responses, requires a sociotechnical approach in their design. This paper addresses a critical issue: existing guardrails lack a well-founded methodology to accommodate the diverse needs of different user groups, particularly concerning access rights. Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.

arXiv:2410.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks that require executing several complex steps before receiving any reward. Properly assigning credit to these steps is essential for enhancing model performance. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm used for LLM finetuning, employs value networks to tackle credit assignment. However, recent approaches achieve strong results without it, raising questions about the efficacy of value networks in practice. In this work, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of value networks and reveal their significant shortcomings in reasoning-heavy LLM tasks, showing that they often produce poor estimate of expected return and barely outperform a random baseline when comparing alternative steps. This motivates our key question: Can improved credit assignment enhance RL training for LLMs? To address this, we propose VinePPO, a straightforward approach that leverages the flexibility of language environments to compute unbiased Monte Carlo-based estimates. Our method consistently outperforms PPO and other baselines across MATH and GSM8K datasets in less wall-clock time (up to 3.0x). Crucially, it achieves higher test accuracy for a given training accuracy, capturing more generalization signal per sample. These results emphasize the importance of accurate credit assignment in RL training of LLM.

Abstract: Open-ended short-answer questions (SAGs) have been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing deeper insights into learners' responses in the context of learning analytics (LA). However, SAGs often present challenges in practice due to the high grading workload and concerns about inconsistent assessments. With recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) offers a promising solution to these challenges. Despite this, current ASAG algorithms are often limited in generalizability and tend to be tailored to specific questions. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-agent ASAG framework, GradeOpt, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as graders for SAGs. More importantly, GradeOpt incorporates two additional LLM-based agents - the reflector and the refiner - into the multi-agent system. This enables GradeOpt to automatically optimize the original grading guidelines by performing self-reflection on its errors. Through experiments on a challenging ASAG task, namely the grading of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and content knowledge (CK) questions, GradeOpt demonstrates superior performance in grading accuracy and behavior alignment with human graders compared to representative baselines. Finally, comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the individual components designed in GradeOpt.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.

Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

Abstract: Low-precision training is considered an effective strategy for reducing both training and downstream inference costs. Previous scaling laws for precision mainly focus on integer quantization, which pay less attention to the constituents in floating-point (FP) quantization, and thus cannot well fit the LLM losses in this scenario. In contrast, while FP quantization training is more commonly implemented in production, it's research has been relatively superficial. In this paper, we thoroughly explore the effects of FP quantization targets, exponent bits, mantissa bits, and the calculation granularity of the scaling factor in FP quantization training performance of LLM models. In addition to an accurate FP quantization unified scaling law, we also provide valuable suggestions for the community: (1) Exponent bits contribute slightly more to the model performance than mantissa bits. We provide the optimal exponent-mantissa bit ratio for different bit numbers, which is available for future reference by hardware manufacturers; (2) We discover the formation of the critical data size in low-precision LLM training. Too much training data exceeding the critical data size will inversely bring in degradation of LLM performance; (3) The optimal FP quantization precision is directly proportional to the computational power, but within a wide computational power range. We estimate that the best cost-performance precision should lie between 4-8 bits.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent's understanding of the synthetic users' needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes. The proposed framework lays the foundation for efficient development of conversational agents through extensive, realistic, and grounded simulated interactions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly struggle with specialized or emerging topics which are rarely seen in the training corpus. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) addresses this by structuring domain knowledge as a graph for dynamic retrieval. However, existing pipelines involve complex engineering workflows, making it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components. It is also challenging to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness due to the overlap between the pretraining and evaluation datasets. In this work, we introduce ROGRAG, a Robustly Optimized GraphRAG framework. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage retrieval mechanism that integrates dual-level with logic form retrieval methods to improve retrieval robustness without increasing computational cost. To further refine the system, we incorporate various result verification methods and adopt an incremental database construction approach. Through extensive ablation experiments, we rigorously assess the effectiveness of each component. Our implementation includes comparative experiments on SeedBench, where Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct initially underperformed. ROGRAG significantly improves the score from 60.0% to 75.0% and outperforms mainstream methods. Experiments on domain-specific datasets reveal that dual-level retrieval enhances fuzzy matching, while logic form retrieval improves structured reasoning, highlighting the importance of multi-stage retrieval.ROGRAG is released as an open-source resource and supports installation with pip.

<title>GRU: Mitigating the Trade-off between Unlearning and Retention for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and safe applications. However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality, leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. In examining the update process for unlearning dynamically, we find gradients hold essential information for revealing this trade-off. In particular, we look at the varying relationship between retention performance and directional disparities between gradients during unlearning. It motivates the sculpting of an update mechanism derived from gradients from two sources, i.e., harmful for retention and useful for unlearning. Accordingly, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an enhanced unlearning framework controlling the updating gradients in a geometry-focused and optimization-driven manner such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized. Specifically, GRU derives a closed-form solution to project the unlearning gradient onto the orthogonal space of that gradient harmful for retention, ensuring minimal deviation from its original direction under the condition that overall performance is retained. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that GRU, as a general framework, is straightforward to implement and efficiently enhances a range of baseline methods through its adaptable and compatible characteristics. Additionally, experimental results show its broad effectiveness across a diverse set of benchmarks for LLM unlearning.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.

Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see: https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/PAST

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space, enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in future research.

Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

Abstract: User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO integrates a practically feasible formulation of the optimal reward baseline that minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is merged into the verl library at https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algo/opo.html.

<title>Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token. This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer (and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are being used for data generation, but creating evaluation benchmarks for them is crucial. This study compared LLM-generated benchmarks with crowdsourced ones for two reading comprehension datasets. While LLMs could produce valid benchmarks at a lower cost, they were found to be less challenging for LLMs compared to the human-authored ones. This raises questions about the effectiveness of using LLMs in creating evaluation data and highlights the importance of critically assessing this approach in benchmark creation. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation. However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent approach to benchmark creation.

<div> Keywords: Human Label Variation, Natural Language Inference, LITEX, annotation, explanation generation

Summary: 
The study focuses on Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and the overlooked challenge of within-label variation. A linguistically-informed taxonomy called LITEX is introduced to categorize free-text explanations, providing insight into annotators' reasoning behind NLI labels. A subset of the e-SNLI dataset is annotated using LITEX to validate its reliability and analyze its alignment with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. The taxonomy is shown to be useful in explanation generation, resulting in linguistically closer explanations to human explanations compared to existing strategies. The study highlights the importance of capturing within-label variation and demonstrates how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can improve the effectiveness of bridging the gap between human and model explanations. <div>

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

Summary:
The article introduces DyePack, a framework that utilizes backdoor attacks to identify models that have used benchmark test sets during training without needing access to internal model details. DyePack incorporates multiple backdoors with stochastic targets to accurately compute the false positive rate when flagging models, thus preventing false accusations while providing strong evidence of contamination. Evaluation of DyePack on five models across three datasets shows its effectiveness in detecting all contaminated models in multiple-choice tasks with very low guaranteed false positive rates. Additionally, it demonstrates good generalization and detection capabilities in open-ended generation tasks with minimal false positives.

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss, logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate (FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets, covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

<div> Keywords: Human preference data, large language models, Alignment Data Map, GPT-4o, efficiency<br />
<br />Summary: <br />Human preference data is crucial for aligning large language models with human values, but collecting it can be costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, a tool called Alignment Data Map has been introduced. This tool, assisted by GPT-4o, analyzes and diagnoses preference data by computing alignment scores for language model-generated responses. By focusing on high-mean, low-variance samples, the Alignment Data Map can achieve performance comparable to using the entire dataset with only 33% of the data. This efficient method can help identify high-quality samples for model alignment without requiring explicit annotations, improving data collection efficiency. Additionally, the Alignment Data Map can also diagnose existing preference datasets by detecting low-impact or potentially misannotated samples. The source code for this tool is available online. <div>

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean, low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated samples. Source code is available online.

Keywords: self-supervised, multilingual, speech processing, fine-tuning, data augmentation <br /><br />Summary: Multilingual speech processing using pre-trained Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has shown strong performance in tasks like Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, these models face challenges with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper explores various strategies for adapting SFMs, such as frozen upstream training and low-rank adaptation, to enhance multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0. The approach includes data augmentation to address performance gaps in few-shot scenarios and introduces a novel LID Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization.

<div> Benchmark, large language models, deep active learning, embeddings, text classification

Summary:
Initializing the labeled pool with diversity-based sampling in deep active learning (AL) can enhance performance, especially in the early iterations when leveraging high-quality embeddings. The choice of an optimal query strategy in AL is influenced by the quality of the embeddings, with strategies like Badge showing robustness across tasks. While computationally inexpensive strategies like Margin sampling can lead to performance spikes on certain datasets, the overall effectiveness of AL strategies is often improved when paired with better-quality embeddings. Context-specific evaluation of AL strategies is crucial, as the performance of these strategies is heavily dependent on both the quality of the embeddings and the specific task being targeted. Overall, utilizing frozen large language model embeddings can help mitigate the computational costs of fine-tuning large backbones in deep active learning scenarios.

arXiv:2506.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing general-purpose representations lets us revisit the practicality of deep active learning (AL): By leveraging frozen LLM embeddings, we can mitigate the computational costs of iteratively fine-tuning large backbones. This study establishes a benchmark and systematically investigates the influence of LLM embedding quality on query strategies in deep AL. We employ five top-performing models from the massive text embedding benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard and two baselines for ten diverse text classification tasks. Our findings reveal key insights: First, initializing the labeled pool using diversity-based sampling synergizes with high-quality embeddings, boosting performance in early AL iterations. Second, the choice of the optimal query strategy is sensitive to embedding quality. While the computationally inexpensive Margin sampling can achieve performance spikes on specific datasets, we find that strategies like Badge exhibit greater robustness across tasks. Importantly, their effectiveness is often enhanced when paired with higher-quality embeddings. Our results emphasize the need for context-specific evaluation of AL strategies, as performance heavily depends on embedding quality and the target task.

The article introduces NovelHopQA, a benchmark that evaluates multi-hop question-answering over long-context excerpts from public-domain novels. It addresses the limitations of current large language models in handling questions that span tens of thousands of tokens and involve multi-hop reasoning. The benchmark varies context length and reasoning depth in natural narrative settings, testing six state-of-the-art models and applying oracle-context filtering to ensure answerability. The study reveals accuracy drops with increased hops and context length, indicating that sheer scale is not enough for robust reasoning. Common breakdowns, such as missed final-hop integration and long-range drift, are identified through failure mode analysis.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to answer questions that span tens of thousands of tokens, especially when multi-hop reasoning is involved. While prior benchmarks explore long-context comprehension or multi-hop reasoning in isolation, none jointly vary context length and reasoning depth in natural narrative settings. We introduce NovelHopQA, the first benchmark to evaluate k1-4 hop QA over 64k-128k-token excerpts from 83 full-length public-domain novels. A keyword-guided pipeline builds hop-separated chains grounded in coherent storylines. We evaluate six state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and apply oracle-context filtering to ensure all questions are genuinely answerable. Human annotators validate both alignment and hop depth. We noticed consistent accuracy drops with increased hops and context length, even in frontier models-revealing that sheer scale does not guarantee robust reasoning. Our failure mode analysis highlights common breakdowns, such as missed final-hop integration and long-range drift. NovelHopQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting to stress-test multi-hop reasoning at scale.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the persistent challenges that figurative language expressions pose for natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly in low-resource languages such as Konkani. We present a hybrid model that integrates a pre-trained Multilingual BERT (mBERT) with a bidirectional LSTM and a linear classifier. This architecture is fine-tuned on a newly introduced annotated dataset for metaphor classification, developed as part of this work. To improve the model's efficiency, we implement a gradient-based attention head pruning strategy. For metaphor classification, the pruned model achieves an accuracy of 78%.

<br />Summary: 
This study addresses the gap in existing paraphrase-type generation methods by leveraging a human-ranked dataset and implementing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align model outputs with human judgments. The DPO-based training improves paraphrase-type generation accuracy by 3 percentage points and increases human preference ratings by 7 percentage points. A newly created human-annotated dataset supports more rigorous future evaluations. The paraphrase-type detection model achieves high F1 scores for various types of paraphrasing, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable and semantically accurate paraphrases. The findings suggest that preference data and DPO training lead to improved paraphrase quality, enabling applications such as better summarization and more robust question-answering. The PTD model surpasses automated metrics and offers a more reliable framework for evaluating paraphrase quality, advancing research in paraphrase types towards user-aligned language generation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paraphrasing re-expresses meaning to enhance applications like text simplification, machine translation, and question-answering. Specific paraphrase types facilitate accurate semantic analysis and robust language models. However, existing paraphrase-type generation methods often misalign with human preferences due to reliance on automated metrics and limited human-annotated training data, obscuring crucial aspects of semantic fidelity and linguistic transformations.
  This study addresses this gap by leveraging a human-ranked paraphrase-type dataset and integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align model outputs directly with human judgments. DPO-based training increases paraphrase-type generation accuracy by 3 percentage points over a supervised baseline and raises human preference ratings by 7 percentage points. A newly created human-annotated dataset supports more rigorous future evaluations. Additionally, a paraphrase-type detection model achieves F1 scores of 0.91 for addition/deletion, 0.78 for same polarity substitution, and 0.70 for punctuation changes.
  These findings demonstrate that preference data and DPO training produce more reliable, semantically accurate paraphrases, enabling downstream applications such as improved summarization and more robust question-answering. The PTD model surpasses automated metrics and provides a more reliable framework for evaluating paraphrase quality, advancing paraphrase-type research toward richer, user-aligned language generation and establishing a stronger foundation for future evaluations grounded in human-centric criteria.

Summary: 
Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to fine-tune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to align with human intent across sequential tasks. Existing approaches using the MoELoRA framework face issues with Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) due to inefficient parameter aggregation. In response, BranchLoRA is proposed as an asymmetric framework that improves efficiency and performance. A flexible tuning-freezing mechanism helps branches specialize in intra-task knowledge and collaborate across tasks to prevent CF. Task-specific routers are gradually introduced to optimize branch distribution over time, ensuring a balanced approach. A task selector simplifies inference by automatically routing test inputs without needing task identification. Experimental results on the MCIT benchmark show that BranchLoRA outperforms MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across different MLLM sizes.

arXiv:2506.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However, these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance. To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time, rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes.

<div> Keywords: large language models, evaluation crisis, unseen knowledge, KnowSum, comprehensive assessment

Summary:<br />
- Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is essential, but current methods may not fully capture their capabilities due to overlooking unseen knowledge encoded by the models.
- The paper introduces KnowSum, a statistical framework that quantifies unseen knowledge for a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, estimating the unobserved portion by extrapolating from observed instances.
- KnowSum is effective in estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval effectiveness, and measuring output diversity, with experiments showing significant differences in comparative rankings of LLMs based on internal knowledge.
- The framework reveals a substantial volume of knowledge omitted in observed LLM performance, emphasizing the need for a more thorough evaluation approach.
- KnowSum provides a valuable tool for assessing LLMs and improving their development by considering unseen knowledge. 

<br /><br />Summary: Accurate evaluation of large language models is crucial but challenging due to the oversight of unseen knowledge. The KnowSum framework addresses this issue by quantifying unobserved knowledge and providing a more comprehensive assessment. Through experiments, KnowSum demonstrates its effectiveness in estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval, and measuring output diversity, highlighting significant differences in comparative rankings of LLMs. This framework offers valuable insights for improving LLM development and enhancing evaluation practices. <div>

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. However, current evaluations often inconsistently reflect the actual capacities of these models. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of many contributing factors to this \textit{evaluation crisis} is the oversight of unseen knowledge -- information encoded by LLMs but not directly observed or not yet observed during evaluations. We introduce KnowSum, a statistical framework designed to provide a more comprehensive assessment by quantifying the unseen knowledge for a class of evaluation tasks. KnowSum estimates the unobserved portion by extrapolating from the appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of KnowSum across three critical applications: estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval effectiveness, and measuring output diversity. Our experiments reveal that a substantial volume of knowledge is omitted when relying solely on observed LLM performance. Importantly, KnowSum yields significantly different comparative rankings for several common LLMs based on their internal knowledge.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, reasoning, medical domain, mathematical domain, supervised fine-tuning<br />
Summary:
This study explores the internal reasoning processes of Large Language Models in the medical and mathematical domains, focusing on knowledge and reasoning quality. The findings reveal three main points: first, the general reasoning abilities of models do not effectively transfer to the medical domain. Second, supervised fine-tuning improves final-answer accuracy but often reduces reasoning quality. Third, reinforcement learning enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate knowledge, leading to improved reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness. Overall, while supervised fine-tuning is essential in the medical domain due to the importance of domain knowledge, reinforcement learning proves beneficial for enhancing reasoning abilities in medical contexts. <div>
arXiv:2506.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used (measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2) SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.

<div> Keywords: language models, lexical identity, inflectional morphology, neural networks, machine learning

Summary: 
- The study investigates how different language models, both classical and contemporary, encode lexical information and inflectional morphology.
- Linear and nonlinear classifiers were trained on layer-wise activations to predict word lemmas and inflectional features.
- Models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout the layers.
- The models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions and rely primarily on memorization for encoding lexical identity.
- The findings reveal consistent patterns across all tested models, indicating that transformer models organize linguistic information similarly, suggesting fundamental properties essential for next-token prediction that are learned early during pretraining.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models, we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word lemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and linearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably, these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and instruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during pretraining.

<div> Keywords: Construction grammar, language acquisition, pretrained language models, constructional learning, BabyLM challenge

Summary: 
In this study, the researchers investigate constructional learning in language models from the 2024 BabyLM challenge. They apply methods from previous research to assess how well these models represent various constructions, even when trained on more realistic amounts of data. The results show that the models are able to capture a diverse range of constructions, including difficult cases that are hard to distinguish. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that the ability to represent constructions accurately may play a role in the models' overall performance on language learning benchmarks. This study highlights the importance of considering the role of constructions in language acquisition and the potential relevance of constructional learning in pretrained language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Construction grammar posits that children acquire constructions (form-meaning pairings) from the statistics of their environment. Recent work supports this hypothesis by showing sensitivity to constructions in pretrained language models (PLMs), including one recent study (Rozner et al., 2025) demonstrating that constructions shape the PLM's output distribution. However, models under study have generally been trained on developmentally implausible amounts of data, casting doubt on their relevance to human language learning. Here we use Rozner et al.'s methods to evaluate constructional learning in models from the 2024 BabyLM challenge. Our results show that even when trained on developmentally plausible quantities of data, models represent diverse constructions, even hard cases that are superficially indistinguishable. We further find correlational evidence that constructional performance may be functionally relevant: models that better represent constructions perform better on the BabyLM benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Neural transducers, speech streaming, speech translation, self-distillation, hierarchical efficient neural transducer

Summary:
Neural transducers (NT) have performed well in automatic speech recognition (ASR) but face challenges in speech translation (ST) due to word reordering issues and performance degradation. The HENT-SRT framework aims to address these challenges by factorizing ASR and translation tasks, using self-distillation with CTC consistency regularization, and improving computational efficiency. By incorporating best practices from ASR transducers and introducing a blank penalty during decoding, the framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance among NT models on Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin conversational datasets. This approach substantially narrows the gap with attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) systems, demonstrating significant progress in the field of speech translation. 

<br /><br />Summary:  
- Neural transducers have shown strong performance in speech recognition but face challenges in speech translation, particularly with word reordering.  
- The HENT-SRT framework addresses these challenges by separating ASR and translation tasks and improving computational efficiency.  
- Self-distillation with CTC consistency regularization helps ensure robust speech translation while maintaining ASR performance.  
- By incorporating best practices from ASR transducers and introducing a blank penalty during decoding, the framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on conversational datasets.  
- The approach significantly narrows the performance gap with attention-based encoder-decoder models in speech translation. <div>

Abstract: Neural transducers (NT) provide an effective framework for speech streaming, demonstrating strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, the application of NT to speech translation (ST) remains challenging, as existing approaches struggle with word reordering and performance degradation when jointly modeling ASR and ST, resulting in a gap with attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Existing NT-based ST approaches also suffer from high computational training costs. To address these issues, we propose HENT-SRT (Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer for Speech Recognition and Translation), a novel framework that factorizes ASR and translation tasks to better handle reordering. To ensure robust ST while preserving ASR performance, we use self-distillation with CTC consistency regularization. Moreover, we improve computational efficiency by incorporating best practices from ASR transducers, including a down-sampled hierarchical encoder, a stateless predictor, and a pruned transducer loss to reduce training complexity. Finally, we introduce a blank penalty during decoding, reducing deletions and improving translation quality. Our approach is evaluated on three conversational datasets Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin achieving new state-of-the-art performance among NT models and substantially narrowing the gap with AED-based systems.

<div> Gender encoding, speech models, speech translation, interpretabilty perspective, translation bias
<br />
Recent studies have shown that speech models can capture gender-specific features, raising questions about how this translates to speech translation (ST) models. The study investigates gender encoding in various ST models for English-French/Italian/Spanish language directions. Results indicate that traditional encoder-decoder models capture gender information, while newer architectures integrating a speech encoder with machine translation systems do not. The lack of gender encoding capabilities in newer models leads to a masculine default translation bias, which is more pronounced in these architectures. The study highlights the importance of considering gender representation in ST models and the potential implications for speaker gender assignment in translation.

Abstract: Recent studies on interpreting the hidden states of speech models have shown their ability to capture speaker-specific features, including gender. Does this finding also hold for speech translation (ST) models? If so, what are the implications for the speaker's gender assignment in translation? We address these questions from an interpretability perspective, using probing methods to assess gender encoding across diverse ST models. Results on three language directions (English-French/Italian/Spanish) indicate that while traditional encoder-decoder models capture gender information, newer architectures -- integrating a speech encoder with a machine translation system via adapters -- do not. We also demonstrate that low gender encoding capabilities result in systems' tendency toward a masculine default, a translation bias that is more pronounced in newer architectures.

<div> AI, Truthfulness, Misinformation, Public health, Bias<br />
Summary:<br />
The study explores the use of AI debate to ensure truthfulness in AI systems, especially in areas like public health where factual accuracy is crucial. By having two AI systems debate on COVID-19 factuality claims, the research aims to guide biased judges towards the truth. The study involved human judges with mainstream or skeptical beliefs, evaluating claims through AI-assisted debate or consultancy protocols. Results showed that AI debate improved judgment accuracy and confidence calibration, particularly benefiting judges with mainstream beliefs. Additionally, AI judges with human-like personas achieved higher accuracy than both human judges and default AI judges, suggesting their potential for overseeing advanced AI models. These findings underscore the potential of AI debate as a scalable and bias-resilient approach to oversight, leveraging diverse human and AI perspectives to enhance accuracy in controversial domains. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As AI grows more powerful, it will increasingly shape how we understand the world. But with this influence comes the risk of amplifying misinformation and deepening social divides-especially on consequential topics like public health where factual accuracy directly impacts well-being. Scalable Oversight aims to ensure AI truthfulness by enabling humans to supervise systems that may exceed human capabilities--yet humans themselves hold different beliefs and biases that impair their judgment. We study whether AI debate can guide biased judges toward the truth by having two AI systems debate opposing sides of controversial COVID-19 factuality claims where people hold strong prior beliefs. We conduct two studies: one with human judges holding either mainstream or skeptical beliefs evaluating factuality claims through AI-assisted debate or consultancy protocols, and a second examining the same problem with personalized AI judges designed to mimic these different human belief systems. In our human study, we find that debate-where two AI advisor systems present opposing evidence-based arguments-consistently improves judgment accuracy and confidence calibration, outperforming consultancy with a single-advisor system by 10% overall. The improvement is most significant for judges with mainstream beliefs (+15.2% accuracy), though debate also helps skeptical judges who initially misjudge claims move toward accurate views (+4.7% accuracy). In our AI judge study, we find that AI judges with human-like personas achieve even higher accuracy (78.5%) than human judges (70.1%) and default AI judges without personas (69.8%), suggesting their potential for supervising frontier AI models. These findings highlight AI debate as a promising path toward scalable, bias-resilient oversight--leveraging both diverse human and AI judgments to move closer to truth in contested domains.

<div> vowels, formants, fricatives, plosives, acoustic cues  
Summary:  
- The study examines the acoustic cues that a modern Conformer-based ASR system relies on for plosives, fricatives, and vowels.
- It finds that the model places importance on vowels' full time spans, particularly the first two formants, more prominently in male speech.
- The ASR system better captures the spectral characteristics of sibilant fricatives compared to non-sibilants.
- It prioritizes the release phase in plosives, specifically focusing on burst characteristics.
- These findings improve the interpretability of ASR models and suggest directions for future research to enhance model robustness.  

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite significant advances in ASR, the specific acoustic cues models rely on remain unclear. Prior studies have examined such cues on a limited set of phonemes and outdated models. In this work, we apply a feature attribution technique to identify the relevant acoustic cues for a modern Conformer-based ASR system. By analyzing plosives, fricatives, and vowels, we assess how feature attributions align with their acoustic properties in the time and frequency domains, also essential for human speech perception. Our findings show that the ASR model relies on vowels' full time spans, particularly their first two formants, with greater saliency in male speech. It also better captures the spectral characteristics of sibilant fricatives than non-sibilants and prioritizes the release phase in plosives, especially burst characteristics. These insights enhance the interpretability of ASR models and highlight areas for future research to uncover potential gaps in model robustness.

Summary:
BehaviorBox is a methodology proposed for automated comparison of language models, using performance-aware contextual embeddings to identify fine-grained features where one model outperforms another. The method extracts coherent features that demonstrate differences in ease of generation between models, such as specific word groups in contexts like "conditional 'were' in the phrase 'if you were'" or "exclamation marks after emotional statements". By applying BehaviorBox, insights into specific contexts that show meaningful differences in performance are uncovered, which cannot be revealed by measures like corpus-level perplexity alone. The comparison includes models of varying sizes, model families, and post-training techniques, providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different language models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Language model evaluation is a daunting task: prompts are brittle, corpus-level perplexities are vague, and the choice of benchmarks are endless. Finding examples that show meaningful, generalizable differences between two LMs is crucial to understanding where one model succeeds and another fails. Can this process be done automatically? In this work, we propose methodology for automated comparison of language models that uses performance-aware contextual embeddings to find fine-grained features of text where one LM outperforms another. Our method, which we name BehaviorBox, extracts coherent features that demonstrate differences with respect to the ease of generation between two LMs. Specifically, BehaviorBox finds features that describe groups of words in fine-grained contexts, such as "conditional 'were' in the phrase 'if you were'" and "exclamation marks after emotional statements", where one model outperforms another within a particular datatset. We apply BehaviorBox to compare models that vary in size, model family, and post-training, and enumerate insights into specific contexts that illustrate meaningful differences in performance which cannot be found by measures such as corpus-level perplexity alone.

Summary: 
This research focuses on improving emotion recognition from speech by identifying segments with relevant acoustic variations. Traditional approaches may overlook fine-grained variations by computing features over entire sentences. The study proposes using word informativeness from a language model to pinpoint semantically important segments for computing acoustic features. By focusing exclusively on these segments, the approach enhances emotion recognition accuracy. The methodology incorporates standard acoustic prosodic features, their functionals, and self-supervised representations. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in emotion recognition performance when features are computed on segments identified based on word informativeness. This highlights the effectiveness of the approach in capturing essential acoustic variations for discerning specific emotions. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In emotion recognition from speech, a key challenge lies in identifying speech signal segments that carry the most relevant acoustic variations for discerning specific emotions. Traditional approaches compute functionals for features such as energy and F0 over entire sentences or longer speech portions, potentially missing essential fine-grained variation in the long-form statistics. This research investigates the use of word informativeness, derived from a pre-trained language model, to identify semantically important segments. Acoustic features are then computed exclusively for these identified segments, enhancing emotion recognition accuracy. The methodology utilizes standard acoustic prosodic features, their functionals, and self-supervised representations. Results indicate a notable improvement in recognition performance when features are computed on segments selected based on word informativeness, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach.

Summary:
The article introduces CoDial, a framework that allows non-technical experts to define, test, and refine system behavior for specialized tasks in domains like law, medicine, and finance. CoDial converts expert knowledge into executable conversation logic using a structured heterogeneous graph. It can be easily implemented in existing guardrailing languages like Colang for interpretable and modifiable dialogue system specification. CoDial achieves state-of-the-art performance on the STAR dataset and competitive results on the MultiWOZ dataset for inference-based models.

Abstract: It is often challenging to teach specialized, unseen tasks to dialogue systems due to the high cost of expert knowledge, training data, and high technical difficulty. To support domain-specific applications - such as law, medicine, or finance - it is essential to build frameworks that enable non-technical experts to define, test, and refine system behaviour with minimal effort. Achieving this requires cross-disciplinary collaboration between developers and domain specialists. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), that converts expert knowledge, represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, into executable conversation logic. CoDial can be easily implemented in existing guardrailing languages, such as Colang, to enable interpretable, modifiable, and true zero-shot specification of task-oriented dialogue systems. Empirically, CoDial achieves state-of-the-art performance on the STAR dataset for inference-based models and is competitive with similar baselines on the well-known MultiWOZ dataset. We also demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Summary:
ImpRAG is a novel retrieval-augmented generation system that integrates retrieval and generation into a single model, eliminating the need for explicit queries. By dividing pretrained language models into specialized groups, ImpRAG optimizes retrieval and generation tasks simultaneously, leading to improved performance on diverse tasks. The system uses a two-stage inference process with the same model parameters for both retrieval and generation, minimizing the gap between retrievers and language models. Experiments on 8 knowledge-intensive tasks show significant improvements in exact match scores on unseen tasks, showcasing ImpRAG's ability to articulate information needs and generalize effectively. The study emphasizes the importance of balancing retrieval and generation parameters and leveraging generation perplexities as retrieval training objectives for enhanced system performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems traditionally treat retrieval and generation as separate processes, requiring explicit textual queries to connect them. This separation can limit the ability of models to generalize across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose a query-free RAG system, named ImpRAG, which integrates retrieval and generation into a unified model. ImpRAG allows models to implicitly express their information needs, eliminating the need for human-specified queries. By dividing pretrained decoder-only language models into specialized layer groups, ImpRAG optimizes retrieval and generation tasks simultaneously. Our approach employs a two-stage inference process, using the same model parameters and forward pass for both retrieval and generation, thereby minimizing the disparity between retrievers and language models. Experiments on 8 knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that ImpRAG achieves 3.6-11.5 improvements in exact match scores on unseen tasks with diverse formats, highlighting its effectiveness in enabling models to articulate their own information needs and generalize across tasks. Our analysis underscores the importance of balancing retrieval and generation parameters and leveraging generation perplexities as retrieval training objectives for enhanced performance.

Abstract: This study examines the prosodic characteristics associated with winning and losing in post-match tennis interviews. Additionally, this research explores the potential to classify match outcomes solely based on post-match interview recordings using prosodic features and self-supervised learning (SSL) representations. By analyzing prosodic elements such as pitch and intensity, alongside SSL models like Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT, the aim is to determine whether an athlete has won or lost their match. Traditional acoustic features and deep speech representations are extracted from the data, and machine learning classifiers are employed to distinguish between winning and losing players. Results indicate that SSL representations effectively differentiate between winning and losing outcomes, capturing subtle speech patterns linked to emotional states. At the same time, prosodic cues -- such as pitch variability -- remain strong indicators of victory.

Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI agents.

<div> Large language models, grammar prompting, syntactic phenomena, model improvement, multilingual performance <br />
Summary:<br />
- Large language models (LLMs) can explain grammatical rules but struggle to apply them accurately.
- The "grammar prompting" approach involves a large LLM providing an explanation of a syntactic rule before the target model makes a decision.
- This method has shown significant improvements over strong baselines in English, Chinese, and Russian benchmarks.
- By providing the explanation back to the target model, the gap between knowing a rule and applying it effectively is bridged.
- Grammar prompting, when combined with chain-of-thought, reduces the average accuracy gap between LLMs and smaller language models by 56%, bringing low-cost SLMs closer to LLM performance in multilingual settings. <div>
arXiv:2506.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain grammatical rules, yet they often fail to apply those rules when judging sentence acceptability. We present "grammar prompting", an explain-then-process paradigm: a large LLM first produces a concise explanation of the relevant syntactic phenomenon, then that explanation is fed back as additional context to the target model -- either an LLM or a smaller language model (SLM) -- before deciding which sentence of a minimal pair is grammatical. On the English BLiMP, Chinese SLING, and Russian RuBLiMP benchmarks, this simple prompt design yields substantial improvements over strong baselines across many syntactic phenomena. Feeding an LLM's metalinguistic explanation back to the target model bridges the gap between knowing a rule and using it. On SLMs, grammar prompting alone trims the average LLM-SLM accuracy gap by about 20%, and when paired with chain-of-thought, by 56% (13.0 pp -> 5.8 pp), all at negligible cost. The lightweight, language-agnostic cue lets low-cost SLMs approach frontier-LLM performance in multilingual settings.

<div> Keyword: Authorship misattribution, Fairness, Misattribution Unfairness Index, Authorship attribution systems, Risk assessment  
Summary:  
The study focuses on the issue of authorship misattribution and its unfair consequences, especially in forensic settings. It introduces a novel measure, Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk), to evaluate the fairness of authorship attribution systems. Through the analysis of five different models on two datasets, the research reveals high levels of unfairness with certain authors facing increased risks of misattribution. The study also highlights the correlation between unfairness and the positioning of authors in the latent search space, emphasizing a higher risk for authors closer to the centroid. These findings stress the importance of considering and communicating misattribution risks to end-users when utilizing such models.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship misattribution can have profound consequences in real life. In forensic settings simply being considered as one of the potential authors of an evidential piece of text or communication can result in undesirable scrutiny. This raises a fairness question: Is every author in the candidate pool at equal risk of misattribution? Standard evaluation measures for authorship attribution systems do not explicitly account for this notion of fairness. We introduce a simple measure, Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk), which is based on how often authors are ranked in the top k for texts they did not write. Using this measure we quantify the unfairness of five models on two different datasets. All models exhibit high levels of unfairness with increased risks for some authors. Furthermore, we find that this unfairness relates to how the models embed the authors as vectors in the latent search space. In particular, we observe that the risk of misattribution is higher for authors closer to the centroid (or center) of the embedded authors in the haystack. These results indicate the potential for harm and the need for communicating with and calibrating end users on misattribution risk when building and providing such models for downstream use.

<div> Toxicity detection, TRuST dataset, language models, benchmark, social groups <br />
Summary:<br />
This paper presents TRuST, a dataset aimed at improving toxicity detection in online content by merging existing datasets. It includes labels for toxicity, target social groups, and toxic spans, covering a diverse range such as ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, and politics. State-of-the-art large language models were benchmarked on toxicity detection, target group identification, and toxic span extraction. Fine-tuned models consistently outperformed zero-shot and few-shot prompting, although some social groups still had low performance. Moreover, the study revealed that reasoning capabilities did not significantly enhance model performance, indicating a lack of strong social reasoning skills in large language models. <div>

Abstract: Toxicity in online content, including content generated by language models, has become a critical concern due to its potential for negative psychological and social impact. This paper introduces TRuST, a comprehensive dataset designed to improve toxicity detection that merges existing datasets, and has labels for toxicity, target social group, and toxic spans. It includes a diverse range of target groups such as ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, and politics, with both human/machine-annotated and human machine-generated data. We benchmark state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on toxicity detection, target group identification, and toxic span extraction. We find that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot and few-shot prompting, though performance remains low for certain social groups. Further, reasoning capabilities do not significantly improve performance, indicating that LLMs have weak social reasoning skills.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This article introduces the Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using short CoT LLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities. By inducing novel reasoning strategies into short CoT LLMs, the dataset enables longer thinking and better thought budget management. The dataset's quality is comparable to existing models like R1. Training on this dataset improves general reasoning skills and serves as a strong foundation for reinforcement learning, leading to 2-3x larger gains with RLVR. This work represents a significant step towards independent LRM development by creating a dataset that can train language models without relying on existing models like R1. <div>
arXiv:2506.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the release of R1, a publicly available large reasoning model (LRM), researchers commonly train new LRMs by training language models on R1's long chain-of-thought (CoT) inferences. While prior works show that LRMs' capabilities can be reproduced through direct distillation, the continued reliance on the existing models (e.g., R1) remains a critical limitation in advancing the field. As a first step toward independent LRM development, this paper explores the possibility of constructing a long CoT dataset with LLMs that are not trained for inference-time scaling. To this end, we present the Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using existing short CoT LLMs. We develop a pipeline that induces o1's novel reasoning strategies into short CoT LLMs, enabling them to think longer and introducing controllability over the thought budget to better manage the overthinking problem. Our extensive analyses validate that our dataset achieves quality comparable to--or slightly below--R1. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that training on our dataset not only strengthens general reasoning skills, but also provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning--models initialized on our data achieve 2-3x larger gains with RLVR.

<div> Keywords: Automatic story generation, coherence, consistency, Storyteller, narrative entity knowledge graph (NEKG)

Summary:
Storyteller is a new approach to automatic story generation that focuses on improving coherence and consistency by introducing a plot node structure based on linguistically grounded subject verb object (SVO) triplets. Unlike existing methods, Storyteller integrates two dynamic modules, the STORYLINE and narrative entity knowledge graph (NEKG), to continuously interact with the story generation process. This integration results in structurally sound, cohesive, and immersive narratives. Extensive experiments show that Storyteller outperforms existing approaches in various aspects, achieving an 84.33% average win rate in human preference evaluation and excelling in creativity, coherence, engagement, and relevance. <div>

Abstract: Stories are central to human culture, serving to share ideas, preserve traditions, and foster connections. Automatic story generation, a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), offers new possibilities for creating personalized content, exploring creative ideas, and enhancing interactive experiences. However, existing methods struggle to maintain narrative coherence and logical consistency. This disconnect compromises the overall storytelling experience, underscoring the need for substantial improvements. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce Storyteller, a novel approach that systemically improves the coherence and consistency of automatically generated stories. Storyteller introduces a plot node structure based on linguistically grounded subject verb object (SVO) triplets, which capture essential story events and ensure a consistent logical flow. Unlike previous methods, Storyteller integrates two dynamic modules, the STORYLINE and narrative entity knowledge graph (NEKG),that continuously interact with the story generation process. This integration produces structurally sound, cohesive and immersive narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Storyteller significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 84.33% average win rate through human preference evaluation. At the same time, it is also far ahead in other aspects including creativity, coherence, engagement, and relevance.

<title>Truth over Tricks: Measuring and Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Misinformation Detection</title>

<div> Keywords: Misinformation detection, Large language models, TruthOverTricks, Data augmentation, Shortcut learning<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new evaluation paradigm called TruthOverTricks for measuring shortcut learning in misinformation detection models. It identifies two types of shortcuts, intrinsic and extrinsic, and evaluates seven detectors across various benchmarks including new datasets. The study reveals that existing models struggle with performance degradation when faced with both natural and adversarial shortcuts. To address this issue, the authors propose SMF, a data augmentation framework that enhances model robustness by encouraging deeper semantic understanding rather than relying on shortcut cues. The results show consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks. The resources for this study have been made publicly available to promote the development of more effective misinformation detectors. <div>
arXiv:2506.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation detection models often rely on superficial cues (i.e., \emph{shortcuts}) that correlate with misinformation in training data but fail to generalize to the diverse and evolving nature of real-world misinformation. This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo. Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that combines structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND integrates sabermetric features like Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index to measure play importance and uses an LLM module to enhance selection based on contextual narrative value. Evaluated on Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND outperforms commercial and statistical baselines, improving F1-score from 42.9% to 84.8%. The hybrid approach of DIAMOND allows for both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness in summarizing baseball events, surpassing the limitations of traditional approaches. The results demonstrate the potential of modular, interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization not only in sports but also in other domains. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable. We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9% (WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines. Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular, interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports and beyond.

Abstract: In this paper we present AnswerCarefully, a dataset for promoting the safety and appropriateness of Japanese LLM outputs. The dataset consists of 1,800 pairs of questions and reference answers, where the questions require special attention in answering. It covers a wide range of risk categories established in prior English-language datasets, but the data samples are original in that they are manually created to reflect the socio-cultural context of LLM usage in Japan. We show that using this dataset for instruction to fine-tune a Japanese LLM led to improved output safety without compromising the utility of general responses. We also report the results of a safety evaluation of 12 Japanese LLMs using this dataset as a benchmark. Finally, we describe the latest update on the dataset which provides English translations and annotations of the questions, aimed at facilitating the derivation of similar datasets in different languages and regions.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called X$^2$-ICL, which enhances in-context learning (ICL) with explanations (X-ICL) to improve the generalization and robustness of large language models (LLMs). X$^2$-ICL systematically explores explanations for all possible labels, leading to more comprehensive and robust decision-making. Experimental results on various natural language understanding datasets confirm the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL in improving robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to existing ICL approaches. This advancement builds on the success of X-ICL in guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the reasoning behind correct labels, further enhancing prediction reliability. The X$^2$-ICL framework offers a promising approach to address the limitations of traditional ICL methods and improve the generalization capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a successful paradigm for leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, it often struggles to generalize beyond the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the existing ICL approaches.

<div> synergistic mechanism, Speculative Decoding, Consultant Decoding, inference speed, generation quality<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study introduces Consultant Decoding (CD) as a novel mechanism for accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs). Unlike Speculative Decoding (SD), CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods computed solely by the LLM, resulting in up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference speed compared to the target model. This efficiency gain is achieved while maintaining generation quality at around 100% of the target model's performance. CD's performance surpasses that of the large target model even though the models have a significant difference in parameter sizes. By reducing the call frequency of the large target model to below 10%, CD proves to be particularly effective in demanding tasks. The results highlight the potential of CD as a powerful approach for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of inference mechanisms for LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergistic mechanism based on Speculative Decoding (SD) has garnered considerable attention as a simple yet effective approach for accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the high rejection rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the overall efficiency gain of SD. In this work, we revisit existing verification mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD). Unlike SD, which relies on a metric derived from importance sampling for verification, CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods computed solely by the LLM. CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation quality (around 100% of the target model's performance). Interestingly, this is achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of magnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents the upper bound for speculative decoding.

Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has gained attention for enhancing large language models. Current evaluations of GraphRAG models lack comprehensive assessment. To address this, GraphRAG-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark, was introduced. It features challenging college-level questions requiring multi-hop reasoning, diverse task coverage, and a holistic evaluation framework. The benchmark spans 16 disciplines and evaluates the entire GraphRAG pipeline. By testing nine contemporary GraphRAG methods on GraphRAG-Bench, insights were gained on graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, providing valuable guidance for the research community. <div>

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

Abstract: Textbooks play a critical role in shaping children's understanding of the world. While previous studies have identified gender inequality in individual countries' textbooks, few have examined the issue cross-culturally. This study applies natural language processing methods to quantify gender inequality in English textbooks from 22 countries across 7 cultural spheres. Metrics include character count, firstness (which gender is mentioned first), and TF-IDF word associations by gender. The analysis also identifies gender patterns in proper names appearing in TF-IDF word lists, tests whether large language models can distinguish between gendered word lists, and uses GloVe embeddings to examine how closely keywords associate with each gender. Results show consistent overrepresentation of male characters in terms of count, firstness, and named entities. All regions exhibit gender inequality, with the Latin cultural sphere showing the least disparity.

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation. In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction.

Summary: 
Emotions play a crucial role in human experiences, and this study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) represent emotions based on nationality. The research investigates whether LLMs exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned specific national personas, and if these attributions align with cultural norms. The analysis reveals significant differences in emotion attributions across countries, with some emotions like shame, fear, and joy being disproportionately assigned to specific regions. Additionally, there is a notable discrepancy between the emotions generated by LLMs and human responses, particularly concerning negative emotions. This indicates the presence of potentially biased and reductive stereotypes in LLM outputs. The study sheds light on the need for further exploration and understanding of how LLMs perceive and represent emotions based on nationality and cultural contexts.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental facet of human experience, varying across individuals, cultural contexts, and nationalities. Given the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) as role-playing agents, we examine whether LLMs exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned nationality-specific personas. Specifically, we investigate how different countries are represented in pre-trained LLMs through emotion attributions and whether these attributions align with cultural norms. Our analysis reveals significant nationality-based differences, with emotions such as shame, fear, and joy being disproportionately assigned across regions. Furthermore, we observe notable misalignment between LLM-generated and human emotional responses, particularly for negative emotions, highlighting the presence of reductive and potentially biased stereotypes in LLM outputs.

Summary: This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) behavior on long-tail distributed texts and their safety implications. It introduces a framework for assessing LLM safety, focusing on instruction refusal and generation safety. The experiments show that LLMs capable of decrypting ciphers may be vulnerable to mismatched-generalization attacks, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Various pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards are evaluated for their strengths and limitations. This study contributes to understanding the safety of LLMs in scenarios involving long-tail texts and provides insights into developing robust safety mechanisms.

arXiv:2506.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs) behavior on long-tail distributed (encrypted) texts and their safety implications. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for developing robust safety mechanisms.

Abstract: In modern dialogue systems, the ability to implicitly infer user backgrounds from conversations and leverage this information for personalized assistance is crucial. However, the scarcity of high-quality data remains a fundamental challenge to evaluating and improving this capability. Traditional dataset construction methods are labor-intensive, resource-demanding, and raise privacy concerns. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach for automatic synthetic data generation and introduce the Implicit Personalized Dialogue (IP-Dialog) benchmark along with a training dataset, covering 10 tasks and 12 user attribute types. Additionally, we develop a systematic evaluation framework with four metrics to assess both attribute awareness and reasoning capabilities. We further propose five causal graphs to elucidate models' reasoning pathways during implicit personalization. Extensive experiments yield insightful observations and prove the reliability of our dataset.

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse, high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning, and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100 diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82\% overall win rate over the baseline method.

<div> Keywords: large language models, safety, helpfulness, preference optimization, mixture of experts 

Summary:
MidPO is a new framework proposed to enhance safety and helpfulness in large language models. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by utilizing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for dual preference optimization. Firstly, MidPO transforms the base model into safety and helpfulness experts, optimizing each independently for optimal performance. Secondly, it incorporates these experts into the MoE framework and uses a dynamic routing mechanism to determine their contributions adaptively. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments on popular datasets, MidPO has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art approaches in both safety and helpfulness. The code and models for MidPO will be made publicly available. 

<br /><br />Summary: MidPO proposes a new framework for enhancing safety and helpfulness in large language models by employing a Mixture of Experts approach for dual preference optimization. It optimizes safety and helpfulness independently before dynamically allocating contributions from each expert to achieve an effective balance. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods in both safety and helpfulness metrics. <div>
arXiv:2506.02460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied across various domains, enhancing safety while maintaining the helpfulness of LLMs has become a critical challenge. Recent studies solve this problem through safety-constrained online preference optimization or safety-constrained offline preference optimization. However, the safety-constrained online methods often suffer from excessive safety, which might reduce helpfulness, while the safety-constrained offline methods perform poorly in adaptively balancing safety and helpfulness. To address these limitations, we propose MidPO, a \textbf{\underline{Mi}}xture of Experts (MoE) framework for safety-helpfulness \textbf{\underline{d}}ual \textbf{\underline{P}}reference \textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization. Firstly, MidPO devises single-preference enhanced direct preference optimization approach to transform the base model into two independent experts, termed safety and helpfulness experts, and fine-tunes the two independent experts for optimal safety or helpfulness performance. Secondly, to achieve an effective balance between safety and helpfulness, MidPO incorporates the two experts into the MoE framework and designs a dynamic routing mechanism to allocate contributions from each expert adaptively. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three popular datasets to demonstrate the proposed MidPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both safety and helpfulness. The code and models will be released.

<div> Keywords: Theory of Mind, multilingual, benchmark, language understanding, limitations 

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of Theory of Mind (ToM) and its importance in human social cognition. It discusses the limitations of existing evaluations of ToM in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have primarily been conducted in English. The authors propose XToM, a multilingual benchmark that assesses ToM in LLMs across five languages. Using XToM, they evaluate the performance of LLMs such as DeepSeek R1 and find that while these models excel in multilingual language understanding, their ability to exhibit Theory of Mind varies across different languages. This study highlights a disparity in LLMs' capacity to replicate human-like mentalizing in diverse linguistic contexts, revealing potential limitations in their ability to reason about mental states across languages. Overall, the findings suggest a need for further research and development to enhance multilingual Theory of Mind capabilities in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer mental states in others, is pivotal for human social cognition. Existing evaluations of ToM in LLMs are largely limited to English, neglecting the linguistic diversity that shapes human cognition. This limitation raises a critical question: can LLMs exhibit Multilingual Theory of Mind, which is the capacity to reason about mental states across diverse linguistic contexts? To address this gap, we present XToM, a rigorously validated multilingual benchmark that evaluates ToM across five languages and incorporates diverse, contextually rich task scenarios. Using XToM, we systematically evaluate LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1), revealing a pronounced dissonance: while models excel in multilingual language understanding, their ToM performance varies across languages. Our findings expose limitations in LLMs' ability to replicate human-like mentalizing across linguistic contexts.

Summary:  
The article introduces an adaptive model merging method called FroM to improve the RegMean method for combining parameters from multiple fine-tuning models without the need for training data. It addresses the task interference problem commonly encountered when merging full fine-tuning models, especially in parameter-efficient scenarios. FroM directly measures model parameters using the Frobenius norm and introduces a hyperparameter for control, resulting in outperforming baseline methods in various fine-tuning scenarios. By leveraging the training data to approximate linear layer outputs before and after merging, FroM effectively fuses knowledge from different models, enhancing performance in specific domains. <div>

Abstract: With the development of large language models, fine-tuning has emerged as an effective method to enhance performance in specific scenarios by injecting domain-specific knowledge. In this context, model merging techniques provide a solution for fusing knowledge from multiple fine-tuning models by combining their parameters. However, traditional methods often encounter task interference when merging full fine-tuning models, and this problem becomes even more evident in parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an improvement to the RegMean method, which indirectly leverages the training data to approximate the outputs of the linear layers before and after merging. We propose an adaptive merging method called FroM, which directly measures the model parameters using the Frobenius norm, without any training data. By introducing an additional hyperparameter for control, FroM outperforms baseline methods across various fine-tuning scenarios, alleviating the task interference problem.

<div> role-playing prompts, model optimization, few-shot learning, prompt methods, performance improvement <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces ORPP, a framework for optimizing and generating role-playing prompts to enhance large language model performance. ORPP focuses on confining prompt search space to role-playing scenarios, activating the model's intrinsic capabilities effectively. It conducts iterative optimization on a subset of training samples to generate high-quality prompts and utilizes few-shot learning for efficiency in generating prompts for the remaining samples. Experimental results show that ORPP outperforms existing prompt optimization methods and can be seamlessly integrated with other prompt techniques for enhanced effectiveness. The framework demonstrates superior "plug-and-play" capability, offering versatility and improved performance on complex tasks. <div>
arXiv:2506.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for eliciting outstanding performance from large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Existing research has explored model-driven strategies for prompt optimization. However, these methods often suffer from high computational overhead or require strong optimization capabilities from the model itself, which limits their broad applicability.To address these challenges, we propose ORPP (Optimized Role-Playing Prompt),a framework that enhances model performance by optimizing and generating role-playing prompts. The core idea of ORPP is to confine the prompt search space to role-playing scenarios, thereby fully activating the model's intrinsic capabilities through carefully crafted, high-quality role-playing prompts. Specifically, ORPP first performs iterative optimization on a small subset of training samples to generate high-quality role-playing prompts. Then, leveraging the model's few-shot learning capability, it transfers the optimization experience to efficiently generate suitable prompts for the remaining samples.Our experimental results show that ORPP not only matches but in most cases surpasses existing mainstream prompt optimization methods in terms of performance. Notably, ORPP demonstrates superior "plug-and-play" capability. In most cases, it can be integrated with various other prompt methods and further enhance their effectiveness.

arXiv:2506.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluations of LLMs' ethical risks and value inclinations often rely on short-form surveys and psychometric tests, yet real-world use involves long-form, open-ended responses -- leaving value-related risks and preferences in practical settings largely underexplored. In this work, we ask: Do value preferences inferred from short-form tests align with those expressed in long-form outputs? To address this question, we compare value preferences elicited from short-form reactions and long-form responses, varying the number of arguments in the latter to capture users' differing verbosity preferences. Analyzing five LLMs (llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, and olmo-7b), we find (1) a weak correlation between value preferences inferred from short-form and long-form responses across varying argument counts, and (2) similarly weak correlation between preferences derived from any two distinct long-form generation settings. (3) Alignment yields only modest gains in the consistency of value expression. Further, we examine how long-form generation attributes relate to value preferences, finding that argument specificity negatively correlates with preference strength, while representation across scenarios shows a positive correlation. Our findings underscore the need for more robust methods to ensure consistent value expression across diverse applications.

Large language models struggle with multi-target reasoning in long-context scenarios. To address this, NeuroSymbolic Augmented Reasoning (NSAR) combines neural and symbolic reasoning. NSAR extracts symbolic facts from text and generates executable Python code for complex reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to perform multi-target reasoning in long-context scenarios where relevant information is scattered across extensive documents. To address this challenge, we introduce NeuroSymbolic Augmented Reasoning (NSAR), which combines the benefits of neural and symbolic reasoning during inference. NSAR explicitly extracts symbolic facts from text and generates executable Python code to handle complex reasoning steps. Through extensive experiments across seven languages and diverse context lengths, we demonstrate that NSAR significantly outperforms both a vanilla RAG baseline and advanced prompting strategies in accurately identifying and synthesizing multiple pieces of information. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining explicit symbolic operations with neural inference for robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning in multilingual settings.

Summary: 
Minos-Corpus is a large-scale dataset that combines human and GPT evaluation data for image-to-text (I2T) and text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. The Minos evaluation model, built upon a 7B backbone, achieves state-of-the-art performance among similar open-source models, especially excelling in T2I evaluation. By utilizing high-quality human evaluation data and training on both I2T and T2I tasks, Minos demonstrates the importance of balanced data selection and Mix-SFT training methods. This comprehensive approach leads to significant advancements in multimodal evaluation capabilities, addressing existing gaps in the evaluation of T2I generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task, and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper, we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

Summary:<br />
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has opened up broader knowledge sources for large language models (LLMs), but factual inconsistencies persist due to noise. The KARE-RAG (Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG) approach presented in this paper aims to improve knowledge utilization by incorporating structured knowledge representations, implementing Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO) during training, and using a contrastive data generation pipeline. These innovations enable better error detection, correction of critical errors, and maintenance of semantic consistency. Experiments show that KARE-RAG significantly enhances RAG pipelines for both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, with improved overall performance and data-efficiency. By focusing on how models process retrieved content, this method opens up possibilities for improving performance across different inference paradigms and scales. The code and data will be publicly available on Github.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access broader knowledge sources, yet factual inconsistencies persist due to noise in retrieved documents-even with advanced retrieval methods. We demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG (Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities. Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies. Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on Github.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of new benchmarks for evaluating their performance in the financial domain. However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles, earnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the real-world dynamics of financial meetings. To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark called $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$, which is a multilingual, multi-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting understanding. First, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ supports English, Chinese, and Japanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse linguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark spans a broad range of financial activities. Finally, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer (QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have significant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting comprehension skills.

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is critical for advancing downstream performance on financial tasks. Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning. Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning. Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https: //github.com/mbzuai-nlp/finchain.

Abstract: LLMssuch as GPT-4 have shown a remarkable ability to solve complex questions by generating step-by-step rationales. Prior works have utilized this capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters). However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers guided by the end task through ablations. Code is released here (https://github.com/Sohanpatnaik106/collate).

Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval has emerged as powerful tools for expanding knowledge sharing across languages. On the other hand, resources on high quality knowledge base are often scarce and in limited languages, therefore an effective embedding model to transform sentences from different languages into a feature vector space same as the knowledge base language becomes the key ingredient for cross language knowledge sharing, especially to transfer knowledge available in high-resource languages to low-resource ones. In this paper we propose a novel strategy to fine-tune multilingual embedding models with weighted sampling for contrastive learning, enabling multilingual information retrieval with a monolingual knowledge base. We demonstrate that the weighted sampling strategy produces performance gains compared to standard ones by up to 31.03\% in MRR and up to 33.98\% in Recall@3. Additionally, our proposed methodology is language agnostic and applicable for both multilingual and code switching use cases.

Abstract: Political online participation in the form of discussing political issues and exchanging opinions among citizens is gaining importance with more and more formats being held digitally. To come to a decision, a careful discussion and consideration of opinions and a civil exchange of arguments, which is defined as the act of deliberation, is desirable. The quality of discussions and participation processes in terms of their deliberativeness highly depends on the design of platforms and processes. To facilitate online communication for both participants and initiators, machine learning methods offer a lot of potential. In this work we want to showcase which issues occur in political online discussions and how machine learning can be used to counteract these issues and enhance deliberation.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but often leads to verbose and redundant outputs, thus increasing inference cost. We hypothesize that many reasoning steps are unnecessary for producing correct answers. To investigate this, we start with a systematic study to examine what is the minimum reasoning required for a model to reach a stable decision. We find that on math reasoning tasks like math, models typically converge to their final answers after 60\% of the reasoning steps, suggesting substantial redundancy in the remaining content. Based on these insights, we propose three inference-time strategies to improve efficiency: (1) early stopping via answer consistency, (2) boosting the probability of generating end-of-reasoning signals, and (3) a supervised method that learns when to stop based on internal activations. Experiments across five benchmarks and five open-weights LLMs show that our methods significantly reduce token usage with little or no accuracy drop. In particular, on NaturalQuestions, Answer Consistency reduces tokens by over 40\% while further improving accuracy. Our work underscores the importance of cost-effective reasoning methods that operate at inference time, offering practical benefits for real-world applications.

<title>CoRe-MMRAG: Cross-Source Knowledge Reconciliation for Multimodal RAG</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}r\textbf{o}ss-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal \textbf{RAG} (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6\% and 9.3\% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively. We release code and data at \href{https://github.com/TyangJN/CoRe-MMRAG}{https://github.com/TyangJN/CoRe-MMRAG}.

<title>Pruning General Large Language Models into Customized Expert Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their substantial model sizes often require substantial computational resources. To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who often need compact expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios. However, most existing pruning methods focus on preserving the model's general capabilities, often requiring extensive post-training or suffering from degraded performance due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a $\underline{Cus}$tom $\underline{Prun}$ing method ($\texttt{Cus-Prun}$) to prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is positioned along the "language", "domain" and "task" dimensions. By identifying and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ creates expert models without any post-training. Our experiments demonstrate that $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ consistently outperforms other methods, achieving minimal loss in both expert and general capabilities across various models from different model families and sizes.

Abstract: Although region-specific large language models (LLMs) are increasingly developed, their safety remains underexplored, particularly in culturally diverse settings like Indonesia, where sensitivity to local norms is essential and highly valued by the community. In this work, we present IndoSafety, the first high-quality, human-verified safety evaluation dataset tailored for the Indonesian context, covering five language varieties: formal and colloquial Indonesian, along with three major local languages: Javanese, Sundanese, and Minangkabau. IndoSafety is constructed by extending prior safety frameworks to develop a taxonomy that captures Indonesia's sociocultural context. We find that existing Indonesian-centric LLMs often generate unsafe outputs, particularly in colloquial and local language settings, while fine-tuning on IndoSafety significantly improves safety while preserving task performance. Our work highlights the critical need for culturally grounded safety evaluation and provides a concrete step toward responsible LLM deployment in multilingual settings. Warning: This paper contains example data that may be offensive, harmful, or biased.

<title>Prosodic Structure Beyond Lexical Content: A Study of Self-Supervised Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02584</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for person names within the specialized domain of Russian news texts concerning cultural events. The study utilizes the unique SPbLitGuide dataset, a collection of event announcements from Saint Petersburg spanning 1999 to 2019. A comparative evaluation of diverse NER models is presented, encompassing established transformer-based architectures such as DeepPavlov, RoBERTa, and SpaCy, alongside recent Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. Key findings highlight the superior performance of GPT-4o when provided with specific prompting for JSON output, achieving an F1 score of 0.93. Furthermore, GPT-4 demonstrated the highest precision at 0.99. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of current NER model capabilities and limitations when applied to morphologically rich languages like Russian within the cultural heritage domain, offering insights for researchers and practitioners. Follow-up evaluation with GPT-4.1 (April 2025) achieves F1=0.94 for both simple and structured prompts, demonstrating rapid progress across model families and simplified deployment requirements.

<title>On Generalization across Measurement Systems: LLMs Entail More Test-Time Compute for Underrepresented Cultures</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02591</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement systems (e.g., currencies) differ across cultures, but the conversions between them are well defined so that humans can state facts using any measurement system of their choice. Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.

<title>Beyond the Surface: Measuring Self-Preference in LLM Judgments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02592</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02592</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit self-preference bias when serving as judges, meaning they tend to favor their own responses over those generated by other models. Existing methods typically measure this bias by calculating the difference between the scores a judge model assigns to its own responses and those it assigns to responses from other models. However, this approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as higher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score differences, even in the absence of bias. To address this issue, we introduce gold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the DBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the scores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding gold judgments. Since gold judgments reflect true response quality, the DBG score mitigates the confounding effect of response quality on bias measurement. Using the DBG score, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess self-preference bias across LLMs of varying versions, sizes, and reasoning abilities. Additionally, we investigate two factors that influence and help alleviate self-preference bias: response text style and the post-training data of judge models. Finally, we explore potential underlying mechanisms of self-preference bias from an attention-based perspective. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zhiyuanc2001/self-preference.

Abstract: Chinese essay writing and its evaluation are critical in educational contexts, yet the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain remain largely underexplored. Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address this gap, we propose \benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative, Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the \textit{Open-Ended} and \textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained, genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \benchName, we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future research on improving essay generation in educational settings.

<title>Overcoming Data Scarcity in Multi-Dialectal Arabic ASR via Whisper Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Although commercial Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems support Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), they struggle with dialectal speech. We investigate the effect of fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper on five major Arabic dialects (Gulf, Levantine, Iraqi, Egyptian, Maghrebi) using Mozilla Common Voice for MSA and the MASC dataset for dialectal speech. We evaluate MSA training size effects, benefits of pre-training on MSA data, and dialect-specific versus dialect-pooled models. We find that small amounts of MSA fine-tuning data yield substantial improvements for smaller models, matching larger non-fine-tuned models. While MSA pre-training shows minimal benefit, suggesting limited shared features between MSA and dialects, our dialect-pooled models perform comparably to dialect-specific ones. This indicates that pooling dialectal data, when properly balanced, can help address data scarcity in low-resource ASR without significant performance loss.

<title>Are Economists Always More Introverted? Analyzing Consistency in Persona-Assigned LLMs</title>

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in diverse applications, where they are assigned a specific persona - such as a happy high school teacher - to guide their responses. While prior research has examined how well LLMs adhere to predefined personas in writing style, a comprehensive analysis of consistency across different personas and task types is lacking. In this paper, we introduce a new standardized framework to analyze consistency in persona-assigned LLMs. We define consistency as the extent to which a model maintains coherent responses when assigned the same persona across different tasks and runs. Our framework evaluates personas across four different categories (happiness, occupation, personality, and political stance) spanning multiple task dimensions (survey writing, essay generation, social media post generation, single turn, and multi-turn conversations). Our findings reveal that consistency is influenced by multiple factors, including the assigned persona, stereotypes, and model design choices. Consistency also varies across tasks, increasing with more structured tasks and additional context. All code is available on GitHub.

<title>EvaLearn: Quantifying the Learning Capability and Efficiency of LLMs via Sequential Problem Solving</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and data will be available soon.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), planning tasks still present challenges for LLM-based agents. Existing planning methods face two key limitations: heavy constraints and cascading errors. To address these limitations, we propose a novel parallel planning paradigm, which Decomposes, Plans for subtasks in Parallel, and Merges subplans into a final plan (DPPM). Specifically, DPPM decomposes the complex task based on constraints into subtasks, generates the subplan for each subtask in parallel, and merges them into a global plan. In addition, our approach incorporates a verification and refinement module, enabling error correction and conflict resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that DPPM significantly outperforms existing methods in travel planning tasks.

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial in NLP tasks, enhancing pretrained models' instruction-following capabilities and task-specific performance. However, obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5. Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization. Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: We analyze the extent to which internal representations of language models (LMs) identify and distinguish mentions of named entities, focusing on the many-to-many correspondence between entities and their mentions. We first formulate two problems of entity mentions -- ambiguity and variability -- and propose a framework analogous to clustering quality metrics. Specifically, we quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different entities remain separated. Our experiments examine five Transformer-based autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to 0.9. Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers. Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations influence word prediction performance. These findings are interpreted through the lens of isomorphism between LM representations and entity-centric knowledge structures in the real world, providing insights into how LMs internally organize and use entity information.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align (Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness, application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process transparency in complex vertical domains.

Abstract: We extracted gender-specific actions from text corpora and Twitter, and compared them to stereotypical expectations of people. We used Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS), a commonsense knowledge repository, to focus on actions that are pertinent to common sense and daily life of humans. We use the gender information of Twitter users and Web-corpus-based pronoun/name gender heuristics to compute the gender bias of the actions. With high recall, we obtained a Spearman correlation of 0.47 between corpus-based predictions and a human gold standard, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.76 when predicting the polarity of the gold standard. We conclude that it is feasible to use natural text (and a Twitter-derived corpus in particular) in order to augment commonsense repositories with the stereotypical gender expectations of actions. We also present a dataset of 441 commonsense actions with human judges' ratings on whether the action is typically/slightly masculine/feminine (or neutral), and another larger dataset of 21,442 actions automatically rated by the methods we investigate in this study.

<title>Multi-task Learning with Active Learning for Arabic Offensive Speech Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of social media has amplified the spread of offensive, violent, and vulgar speech, which poses serious societal and cybersecurity concerns. Detecting such content in Arabic text is particularly complex due to limited labeled data, dialectal variations, and the language's inherent complexity. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-task learning (MTL) with active learning to enhance offensive speech detection in Arabic social media text. By jointly training on two auxiliary tasks, violent and vulgar speech, the model leverages shared representations to improve the detection accuracy of the offensive speech. Our approach dynamically adjusts task weights during training to balance the contribution of each task and optimize performance. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we employ an active learning strategy through several uncertainty sampling techniques to iteratively select the most informative samples for model training. We also introduce weighted emoji handling to better capture semantic cues. Experimental results on the OSACT2022 dataset show that the proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art macro F1-score of 85.42%, outperforming existing methods while using significantly fewer fine-tuning samples. The findings of this study highlight the potential of integrating MTL with active learning for efficient and accurate offensive language detection in resource-constrained settings.

<title>Exploiting the English Vocabulary Profile for L2 word-level vocabulary assessment with LLMs</title>

Abstract: Vocabulary use is a fundamental aspect of second language (L2) proficiency. To date, its assessment by automated systems has typically examined the context-independent, or part-of-speech (PoS) related use of words. This paper introduces a novel approach to enable fine-grained vocabulary evaluation exploiting the precise use of words within a sentence. The scheme combines large language models (LLMs) with the English Vocabulary Profile (EVP). The EVP is a standard lexical resource that enables in-context vocabulary use to be linked with proficiency level. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to assign proficiency levels to individual words as they appear in L2 learner writing, addressing key challenges such as polysemy, contextual variation, and multi-word expressions. We compare LLMs to a PoS-based baseline. LLMs appear to exploit additional semantic information that yields improved performance. We also explore correlations between word-level proficiency and essay-level proficiency. Finally, the approach is applied to examine the consistency of the EVP proficiency levels. Results show that LLMs are well-suited for the task of vocabulary assessment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive results in natural language processing tasks but require a significant amount of computational and memory resources. Structured matrix representations are a promising way for reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the compressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient projection operations. Code is available at https://github.com/GrishKate/ProcrustesGPT

<title>TO-GATE: Clarifying Questions and Summarizing Responses with Trajectory Optimization for Eliciting Human Preference</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can effectively elicit human preferences through multi-turn dialogue. Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in historical texts presents unique challenges due to non-standardized language, archaic orthography, and nested or overlapping entities. This study benchmarks a diverse set of NER approaches, ranging from classical Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and spaCy-based models to transformer-based architectures such as CamemBERT and sequence-labeling models like Flair. Experiments are conducted on the GeoEDdA dataset, a richly annotated corpus derived from 18th-century French encyclopedias. We propose framing NER as both token-level and span-level classification to accommodate complex nested entity structures typical of historical documents. Additionally, we evaluate the emerging potential of few-shot prompting with generative language models for low-resource scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially on nested entities, generative models offer promising alternatives when labeled data are scarce. The study highlights ongoing challenges in historical NER and suggests avenues for hybrid approaches combining symbolic and neural methods to better capture the intricacies of early modern French text.

This success has led to widespread claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in these models. In this paper, we present a theoretical counter-perspective: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) does not elicit genuine, abstract reasoning. Instead, we argue that Chain-of-Thought functions as a powerful structural constraint that guides Large Language Models to imitate the form of reasoning. By forcing the generation of intermediate steps, Chain-of-Thought leverages the model immense capacity for sequence prediction and pattern matching, effectively constraining its output to sequences that resemble coherent thought processes.

Abstract: Although Germany has a diverse landscape of dialects, they are underrepresented in current automatic speech recognition (ASR) research. To enable studies of how robust models are towards dialectal variation, we present Betthupferl, an evaluation dataset containing four hours of read speech in three dialect groups spoken in Southeast Germany (Franconian, Bavarian, Alemannic), and half an hour of Standard German speech. We provide both dialectal and Standard German transcriptions, and analyze the linguistic differences between them. We benchmark several multilingual state-of-the-art ASR models on speech translation into Standard German, and find differences between how much the output resembles the dialectal vs. standardized transcriptions. Qualitative error analyses of the best ASR model reveal that it sometimes normalizes grammatical differences, but often stays closer to the dialectal constructions.

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast, human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions, and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0% batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and emergent expert-like reasoning. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/cell-o1.

<title>A Controllable Examination for Long-Context Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing frameworks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLM) can be broadly categorized into real-world and synthetic tasks. Despite their utility, both approaches are accompanied by certain intrinsic limitations. Real-world tasks are too complex to interpret or characterize and are susceptible to data contamination. In contrast, synthetic tasks often adopt the needle-in-the-haystack (NIAH) format, wherein a lack of coherence between the "needle" and the "haystack" compromises their validity as proxies for realistic applications. In response to these challenges, we posit that an ideal long-context evaluation framework should be characterized by three essential features: $\textit{seamless context}$, $\textit{controllable setting}$, and $\textit{sound evaluation}$. This study introduces $\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a novel benchmark that utilizes artificially generated biographies as a controlled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions of $\textit{understanding}$, $\textit{reasoning}$, and $\textit{trustworthiness}$. Our experimental evaluation, which includes $\textbf{18}$ LCLMs in total, demonstrates that most models still exhibit deficiencies in semantic understanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved results and are less trustworthy as context length increases. Our further analysis indicates some design choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual non-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering them vulnerable to test the model long-context capabilities. Moreover, we also reveal that long-context continual pretraining primarily adjusts RoPE embedding to accommodate extended context lengths. To sum up, compared to previous synthetic benchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between mirroring authentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is highly interpretable and configurable.

Abstract: In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search for Symptoms of Depression. Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance. Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision (R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's symptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance, particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble methods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation, outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM) automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score. We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning). Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly, independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of $2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six benchmarks.

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs) poses potential risks, motivating the development of machine-generated text (MGT) detection. Existing literature primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models show superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results across diverse domains, yet their development remains reliant on vast amounts of publicly available data, raising concerns about data scarcity and the lack of access to domain-specific, sensitive information. Federated Learning (FL) presents a compelling framework to address these challenges by enabling decentralized fine-tuning on pre-trained LLMs without sharing raw data. However, the compatibility and performance of pre-trained LLMs in FL settings remain largely under explored. We introduce the FlowerTune LLM Leaderboard, a first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite designed to evaluate federated fine-tuning of LLMs across four diverse domains: general NLP, finance, medical, and coding. Each domain includes federated instruction-tuning datasets and domain-specific evaluation metrics. Our results, obtained through a collaborative, open-source and community-driven approach, provide the first comprehensive comparison across 26 pre-trained LLMs with different aggregation and fine-tuning strategies under federated settings, offering actionable insights into model performance, resource constraints, and domain adaptation. This work lays the foundation for developing privacy-preserving, domain-specialized LLMs for real-world applications.

<title>Expanding before Inferring: Enhancing Factuality in Large Language Models through Premature Layers Interpolation</title>

arXiv:2506.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, their tendency to produce factually inconsistent outputs, commonly referred to as ''hallucinations'', remains a critical challenge. Existing approaches, such as retrieval-based and inference-time correction methods, primarily address this issue at the input or output level, often overlooking the intrinsic information refinement process and the role of premature layers. Meanwhile, alignment- and fine-tuning-based methods are resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose PLI (Premature Layers Interpolation), a novel, training-free, and plug-and-play intervention designed to enhance factuality. PLI mitigates hallucinations by inserting premature layers formed through mathematical interpolation with adjacent layers. Inspired by stable diffusion and sampling steps, PLI extends the depth of information processing and transmission in LLMs, improving factual coherence. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that PLI effectively reduces hallucinations while outperforming existing baselines in most cases. Further analysis suggests that the success of layer interpolation is closely linked to LLMs' internal mechanisms. To promote reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, which can model simultaneous bidirectional features of human conversations such as speech overlaps and backchannels, have attracted significant attention recently. However, the study of full-duplex spoken dialogue systems for the Japanese language has been limited, and the research on their development in Japanese remains scarce. In this paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue model in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in English. Our model is trained through a two-stage process: pre-training on a large-scale spoken dialogue data in Japanese, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality stereo spoken dialogue data. We further enhance the model's performance by incorporating synthetic dialogue data generated by a multi-stream text-to-speech system. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the trained model outperforms Japanese baseline models in both naturalness and meaningfulness.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.
  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information. Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.
  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.
  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.

Abstract: Idioms are defined as a group of words with a figurative meaning not deducible from their individual components. Although modern machine translation systems have made remarkable progress, translating idioms remains a major challenge, especially for speech-to-text systems, where research on this topic is notably sparse. In this paper, we systematically evaluate idiom translation as compared to conventional news translation in both text-to-text machine translation (MT) and speech-to-text translation (SLT) systems across two language pairs (German to English, Russian to English). We compare state-of-the-art end-to-end SLT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, Whisper Large v3) with MT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, No Language Left Behind), Large Language Models (DeepSeek, LLaMA) and cascaded alternatives. Our results reveal that SLT systems experience a pronounced performance drop on idiomatic data, often reverting to literal translations even in higher layers, whereas MT systems and Large Language Models demonstrate better handling of idioms. These findings underscore the need for idiom-specific strategies and improved internal representations in SLT architectures.

Abstract: Privacy policies inform users about data collection and usage, yet their complexity limits accessibility for diverse populations. Existing Privacy Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from 0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without additional training data. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured agent collaboration in mitigating dialect biases and underscore the importance of designing NLP systems that account for linguistic diversity to ensure equitable access to privacy information.

Abstract: The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific legal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to statutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) internalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.

Abstract: Modern human labor is characterized by specialization; we train for years and develop particular tools that allow us to perform well across a variety of tasks. In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution, web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly, OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1, 1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: Understanding user queries is fundamental in many applications, such as home assistants, booking systems, or recommendations. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop accurate Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) approaches to ensure the reliability of the considered system. Current State-of-the-Art SLU techniques rely on large amounts of training data; however, only limited annotated examples are available for specific tasks or languages.
  In the meantime, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on unseen tasks in a few-shot setting when provided with adequate prompts. In this work, we propose to explore example selection by leveraging Information retrieval (IR) approaches to build an enhanced prompt that is applied to an SLU task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several SLU benchmarks. Experimental results show that lexical IR methods significantly enhance performance without increasing prompt length.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances large language models (LLMs) in complex, long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning. The advanced VAPO framework, despite sophisticated mechanisms like Decoupled GAE, theoretically faces fundamental limitations in comprehensively modeling and leveraging deep, long-term value for fine-grained, step-by-step policy guidance in extended reasoning chains. We argue these limitations stem from inherent difficulties in credit assignment, value function representational capacity with temporally abstracted goals, and translating global value signals into local policy improvements, especially with sparse rewards. Our theoretical analysis examines these aspects to illuminate VAPO's boundaries in long-term value modeling, aiming to deepen understanding of current RL for advanced reasoning and suggest future research for more robust LLM agents.

Abstract: Factuality is a necessary precursor to useful educational tools. As adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education continues of grow, ensuring correctness in all settings is paramount. Despite their strong English capabilities, LLM performance in other languages is largely untested. In this work, we evaluate the correctness of the Llama3.1 family of models in answering factual questions appropriate for middle and high school students. We demonstrate that LLMs not only provide extraneous and less truthful information, but also exacerbate existing biases against rare languages.

Abstract: How well do modern long-context language models understand literary fiction? We explore this question via the task of literary evidence retrieval, repurposing the RELiC dataset of That et al. (2022) to construct a benchmark where the entire text of a primary source (e.g., The Great Gatsby) is provided to an LLM alongside literary criticism with a missing quotation from that work. This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both global narrative reasoning and close textual examination. We curate a high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human verification. Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini Pro 2.5 can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy). In contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models. Despite their speed and apparent accuracy, even the strongest models struggle with nuanced literary signals and overgeneration, signaling open challenges for applying LLMs to literary analysis. We release our dataset and evaluation code to encourage future work in this direction.

<title>Beyond Text Compression: Evaluating Tokenizers Across Scales</title>

Abstract: The choice of tokenizer can profoundly impact language model performance, yet accessible and reliable evaluations of tokenizer quality remain an open challenge. Inspired by scaling consistency, we show that smaller models can accurately predict significant differences in tokenizer impact on larger models at a fraction of the compute cost. By systematically evaluating both English-centric and multilingual tokenizers, we find that tokenizer choice has negligible effects on tasks in English but results in consistent performance differences in multilingual settings. We propose new intrinsic tokenizer metrics inspired by Zipf's law that correlate more strongly with downstream performance than text compression when modeling unseen languages. By combining several metrics to capture multiple aspects of tokenizer behavior, we develop a reliable framework for intrinsic tokenizer evaluations. Our work offers a more efficient path to informed tokenizer selection in future language model development.

<title>Critique-GRPO: Advancing LLM Reasoning with Natural Language and Numerical Feedback</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

Abstract: Analog circuit topology synthesis is integral to Electronic Design Automation (EDA), enabling the automated creation of circuit structures tailored to specific design requirements. However, the vast design search space and strict constraint adherence make efficient synthesis challenging. Leveraging the versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose AUTOCIRCUIT-RL,a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for automated analog circuit synthesis. The framework operates in two phases: instruction tuning, where an LLM learns to generate circuit topologies from structured prompts encoding design constraints, and RL refinement, which further improves the instruction-tuned model using reward models that evaluate validity, efficiency, and output voltage. The refined model is then used directly to generate topologies that satisfy the design constraints. Empirical results show that AUTOCIRCUIT-RL generates ~12% more valid circuits and improves efficiency by ~14% compared to the best baselines, while reducing duplicate generation rates by ~38%. It achieves over 60% success in synthesizing valid circuits with limited training data, demonstrating strong generalization. These findings highlight the framework's effectiveness in scaling to complex circuits while maintaining efficiency and constraint adherence, marking a significant advancement in AI-driven circuit design.

Abstract: We propose CURE, a novel reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated reward design that co-evolves coding and unit test generation capabilities based on their interaction outcomes, without any ground-truth code as supervision. This approach enables flexible and scalable training and allows the unit tester to learn directly from the coder's mistakes. Our derived ReasonFlux-Coder-7B and 14B models improve code generation accuracy by 5.3% and Best-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models, outperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder. They naturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic coding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT model, our ReasonFlux-Coder-4B consistently outperforms Qwen3-4B while achieving 64.8% inference efficiency in unit test generation. Notably, we also find that our model can serve as an effective reward model for reinforcement learning on base models. Project: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/CURE

<title>GUI-Actor: Coordinate-Free Visual Grounding for GUI Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03143</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated  token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.

Abstract: Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge. Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources, but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM), neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.

<title>Causal Estimation of Tokenisation Bias</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.

Abstract: To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents, recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts, limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably, the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

Abstract: We present a novel non attention based architecture for large language models (LLMs) that efficiently handles very long context windows, on the order of hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of tokens. Unlike traditional Transformer designs, which suffer from quadratic memory and computation overload due to the nature of the self attention mechanism, our model avoids token to token attention entirely. Instead, it combines the following complementary components: State Space blocks (inspired by S4) that learn continuous time convolution kernels and scale near linearly with sequence length, Multi Resolution Convolution layers that capture local context at different dilation levels, a lightweight Recurrent Supervisor to maintain a global hidden state across sequential chunks, and Retrieval Augmented External Memory that stores and retrieves high-level chunk embeddings without reintroducing quadratic operations.

Abstract: Quantization effectively reduces the serving costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) by speeding up data movement through compressed parameters and enabling faster operations via integer arithmetic. However, activating integer arithmetic requires quantizing both weights and activations, which poses challenges due to the significant outliers in LLMs that increase quantization error. In this work, we investigate these outliers with an emphasis on their effect on layer-wise quantization error, then examine how smoothing and rotation transform the observed values. Our primary contributions include introducing a new metric to measure and visualize quantization difficulty based on channel magnitudes, as well as proposing a hybrid approach that applies channel-wise scaling before rotation, supported by a mathematical formulation of its benefits.

Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents. Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering, i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories, especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work on voice agents.

Abstract: Enabling robots to accurately interpret and execute spoken language instructions is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional methods rely on speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, often discarding crucial prosodic cues needed for disambiguating intent. We propose a novel approach that directly leverages speech prosody to infer and resolve instruction intent. Predicted intents are integrated into large language models via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans. Additionally, we present the first ambiguous speech dataset for robotics, designed to advance research in speech disambiguation. Our method achieves 95.79% accuracy in detecting referent intents within an utterance and determines the intended task plan of ambiguous instructions with 71.96% accuracy, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve human-robot communication.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has seen significant progress with deep learning, yet remains challenging for Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) due to the scarcity of annotated data. In this work, we explore unsupervised learning to improve SER in low-resource settings. Specifically, we investigate contrastive learning (CL) and Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) as self-supervised approaches to enhance cross-lingual generalization. Our methods achieve notable F1 score improvements of 10.6% in Urdu, 15.2% in German, and 13.9% in Bangla, demonstrating their effectiveness in LRLs. Additionally, we analyze model behavior to provide insights on key factors influencing performance across languages, and also highlighting challenges in low-resource SER. This work provides a foundation for developing more inclusive, explainable, and robust emotion recognition systems for underrepresented languages.

<title>Assigning Distinct Roles to Quantized and Low-Rank Matrices Toward Optimal Weight Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components ($\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$) is a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing joint optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to leverage each component's unique strengths. In this work, we introduce Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This structured decomposition mitigates outliers' negative impact on quantization, enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings.

Abstract: Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline system.

Abstract: Training SER models in natural, spontaneous speech is especially challenging due to the subtle expression of emotions and the unpredictable nature of real-world audio. In this paper, we present a robust system for the INTERSPEECH 2025 Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic Conditions Challenge, focusing on categorical emotion recognition. Our method combines state-of-the-art audio models with text features enriched by prosodic and spectral cues. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of Fundamental Frequency (F0) quantization and the use of a pretrained audio tagging model. We also employ an ensemble model to improve robustness. On the official test set, our system achieved a Macro F1-score of 39.79% (42.20% on validation). Our results underscore the potential of these methods, and analysis of fusion techniques confirmed the effectiveness of Graph Attention Networks. Our source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have shown notable progress in scaling test-time compute effectively. In this work, we investigate how synthesized RL data can further improve RLVR. To this end, we propose \textbf{SynthRL}-a scalable and guaranteed pipeline for automatic data scaling in reasoning-oriented RL training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable, challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning patterns.

Abstract: This research aims to develop a dynamic and scalable framework to facilitate harmonization of Common Data Elements (CDEs) across heterogeneous biomedical datasets by addressing challenges such as semantic heterogeneity, structural variability, and context dependence to streamline integration, enhance interoperability, and accelerate scientific discovery. Our methodology leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware text embeddings that convert CDEs into dense vectors capturing semantic relationships and patterns. These embeddings are clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to group semantically similar CDEs. The framework incorporates four key steps: (1) LLM-based text embedding to mathematically represent semantic context, (2) unsupervised clustering of embeddings via HDBSCAN, (3) automated labeling using LLM summarization, and (4) supervised learning to train a classifier assigning new or unclustered CDEs to labeled clusters. Evaluated on the NIH NLM CDE Repository with over 24,000 CDEs, the system identified 118 meaningful clusters at an optimized minimum cluster size of 20. The classifier achieved 90.46 percent overall accuracy, performing best in larger categories. External validation against Gravity Projects Social Determinants of Health domains showed strong agreement (Adjusted Rand Index 0.52, Normalized Mutual Information 0.78), indicating that embeddings effectively capture cluster characteristics. This adaptable and scalable approach offers a practical solution to CDE harmonization, improving selection efficiency and supporting ongoing data interoperability.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) offers a robust solution for speech recognition in challenging environments, such as cocktail-party scenarios, where relying solely on audio proves insufficient. However, current AVSR models are often optimized for idealized scenarios with consistently active speakers, overlooking the complexities of real-world settings that include both speaking and silent facial segments. This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel audio-visual cocktail-party dataset designed to benchmark current AVSR systems and highlight the limitations of prior approaches in realistic noisy conditions. Additionally, we contribute a 1526-hour AVSR dataset comprising both talking-face and silent-face segments, enabling significant performance gains in cocktail-party environments. Our approach reduces WER by 67% relative to the state-of-the-art, reducing WER from 119% to 39.2% in extreme noise, without relying on explicit segmentation cues.

<title>KDRL: Post-Training Reasoning LLMs via Unified Knowledge Distillation and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) post-training have leveraged two distinct paradigms to enhance reasoning capabilities: reinforcement learning (RL) and knowledge distillation (KD). While RL enables the emergence of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories. Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in transforming machine learning research, yet their capability to faithfully implement novel ideas from recent research papers-ideas unseen during pretraining-remains unclear. We introduce ResearchCodeBench, a benchmark of 212 coding challenges that evaluates LLMs' ability to translate cutting-edge ML contributions from top 2024-2025 research papers into executable code. We assessed 30+ proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that even the best models correctly implement less than 40% of the code. We find Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview to perform best at 37.3% success rate, with O3 (High) and O4-mini (High) following behind at 32.3% and 30.8% respectively. We present empirical findings on performance comparison, contamination, and error patterns. By providing a rigorous and community-driven evaluation platform, ResearchCodeBench enables continuous understanding and advancement of LLM-driven innovation in research code generation.

<title>StarVC: A Unified Auto-Regressive Framework for Joint Text and Speech Generation in Voice Conversion</title>

Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS). Audio demo can be found at: https://thuhcsi.github.io/StarVC/.

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector, resulting in a nonlinear recursive structure. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Nonlinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we propose a novel Nonlinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates its superior performance and computation efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Abstract: The inherent risk of generating harmful and unsafe content by Large Language Models (LLMs), has highlighted the need for their safety alignment. Various techniques like supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red-teaming were developed for ensuring the safety alignment of LLMs. However, the robustness of these aligned LLMs is always challenged by adversarial attacks that exploit unexplored and underlying vulnerabilities of the safety alignment. In this paper, we develop a novel black-box jailbreak attack, called BitBypass, that leverages hyphen-separated bitstream camouflage for jailbreaking aligned LLMs. This represents a new direction in jailbreaking by exploiting fundamental information representation of data as continuous bits, rather than leveraging prompt engineering or adversarial manipulations. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral, in adversarial perspective, revealed the capabilities of BitBypass in bypassing their safety alignment and tricking them into generating harmful and unsafe content. Further, we observed that BitBypass outperforms several state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks in terms of stealthiness and attack success. Overall, these results highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of BitBypass in jailbreaking these state-of-the-art LLMs.

Abstract: Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of web application testing.

<title>Response-Level Rewards Are All You Need for Online Reinforcement Learning in LLMs: A Mathematical Perspective</title>

Abstract: We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e., intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward, while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.

Abstract: This paper addresses source tracing in synthetic speech-identifying generative systems behind manipulated audio via speaker recognition-inspired pipelines. While prior work focuses on spoofing detection, source tracing lacks robust solutions. We evaluate two approaches: classification-based and metric-learning. We tested our methods on the MLAADv5 benchmark using ResNet and self-supervised learning (SSL) backbones. The results show that ResNet achieves competitive performance with the metric learning approach, matching and even exceeding SSL-based systems. Our work demonstrates ResNet's viability for source tracing while underscoring the need to optimize SSL representations for this task. Our work bridges speaker recognition methodologies with audio forensic challenges, offering new directions for combating synthetic media manipulation.

Abstract: Image scoring is a crucial task in numerous real-world applications. To trust a model's judgment, understanding its rationale is essential. This paper proposes a novel training method for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to generate not only image scores but also corresponding justifications in natural language. Leveraging only an image scoring dataset and an instruction-tuned VLM, our method enables self-training, utilizing the VLM's generated text without relying on external data or models. In addition, we introduce a simple method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities and achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, leading to their widespread adoption in recent years. Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.

Abstract: We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can induce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text, using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations, Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify data worth closer attention.

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning (MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU) still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially for preservation and robustness. Code and models are available at https://github.com/ryliu68/IGMU.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information (MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases. Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall, our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/ChnQ/MI-Peaks.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as pivotal for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. Fine-grained MoE approaches - utilizing more numerous, smaller experts - have demonstrated potential in improving model convergence and quality. This work proposes a set of training recipes and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of fine-grained MoE, directly comparing its scaling properties against standard MoE configurations for models with up to 56B total (17B active) parameters. We investigate convergence speed, model performance on downstream benchmarks, and practical training considerations across various setups. Overall, at the largest scale we show that fine-grained MoE achieves better validation loss and higher accuracy across a set of downstream benchmarks. This study offers empirical grounding and practical insights for leveraging fine-grained MoE in the development of future large-scale models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable" scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law.

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks, such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential directions for future research.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.

Abstract: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

<title>Can Character-based Language Models Improve Downstream Task Performance in Low-Resource and Noisy Language Scenarios?</title>

Abstract: Recent impressive improvements in NLP, largely based on the success of contextual neural language models, have been mostly demonstrated on at most a couple dozen high-resource languages. Building language models and, more generally, NLP systems for non-standardized and low-resource languages remains a challenging task. In this work, we focus on North-African colloquial dialectal Arabic written using an extension of the Latin script, called NArabizi, found mostly on social media and messaging communication. In this low-resource scenario with data displaying a high level of variability, we compare the downstream performance of a character-based language model on part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing to that of monolingual and multilingual models. We show that a character-based model trained on only 99k sentences of NArabizi and fined-tuned on a small treebank of this language leads to performance close to those obtained with the same architecture pre-trained on large multilingual and monolingual models. Confirming these results a on much larger data set of noisy French user-generated content, we argue that such character-based language models can be an asset for NLP in low-resource and high language variability set-tings.

Abstract: While contrastive learning greatly advances the representation of sentence embeddings, it is still limited by the size of the existing sentence datasets. In this paper, we present TransAug (Translate as Augmentation), which provide the first exploration of utilizing translated sentence pairs as data augmentation for text, and introduce a two-stage paradigm to advances the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings. Instead of adopting an encoder trained in other languages setting, we first distill a Chinese encoder from a SimCSE encoder (pretrained in English), so that their embeddings are close in semantic space, which can be regraded as implicit data augmentation. Then, we only update the English encoder via cross-lingual contrastive learning and frozen the distilled Chinese encoder. Our approach achieves a new state-of-art on standard semantic textual similarity (STS), outperforming both SimCSE and Sentence-T5, and the best performance in corresponding tracks on transfer tasks evaluated by SentEval.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown outstanding results in natural language processing but face challenges in applications like classifying small-scale clinical texts, especially with constrained computational resources. This study presents a customized Mixture of Expert (MoE) Transformer models for classifying small-scale French clinical texts at CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital. The MoE-Transformer addresses the dual challenges of effective training with limited data and low-resource computation suitable for in-house hospital use. Despite the success of biomedical pre-trained models such as CamemBERT-bio, DrBERT, and AliBERT, their high computational demands make them impractical for many clinical settings. Our MoE-Transformer model not only outperforms DistillBERT, CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and Transformer models on the same dataset but also achieves impressive results: an accuracy of 87\%, precision of 87\%, recall of 85\%, and F1-score of 86\%. While the MoE-Transformer does not surpass the performance of biomedical pre-trained BERT models, it can be trained at least 190 times faster, offering a viable alternative for settings with limited data and computational resources. Although the MoE-Transformer addresses challenges of generalization gaps and sharp minima, demonstrating some limitations for efficient and accurate clinical text classification, this model still represents a significant advancement in the field. It is particularly valuable for classifying small French clinical narratives within the privacy and constraints of hospital-based computational resources.

Abstract: Entity Set Expansion (ESE) aims to identify new entities belonging to the same semantic class as the given set of seed entities. Traditional methods solely relied on positive seed entities to represent the target fine-grained semantic class, rendering them tough to represent ultra-fine-grained semantic classes. Specifically, merely relying on positive seed entities leads to two inherent shortcomings: (i) Ambiguity among ultra-fine-grained semantic classes. (ii) Inability to define ``unwanted'' semantics. Hence, previous ESE methods struggle to address the ultra-fine-grained ESE (Ultra-ESE) task. To solve this issue, we first introduce negative seed entities in the inputs, which jointly describe the ultra-fine-grained semantic class with positive seed entities. Negative seed entities eliminate the semantic ambiguity by providing a contrast between positive and negative attributes. Meanwhile, it provides a straightforward way to express ``unwanted''. To assess model performance in Ultra-ESE and facilitate further research, we also constructed UltraWiki, the first large-scale dataset tailored for Ultra-ESE. UltraWiki encompasses 50,973 entities and 394,097 sentences, alongside 236 ultra-fine-grained semantic classes, where each class is represented with 3-5 positive and negative seed entities. Moreover, a retrieval-based framework RetExpan and a generation-based framework GenExpan are proposed to provide powerful baselines for Ultra-ESE. Additionally, we devised two strategies to enhance models' comprehension of ultra-fine-grained entities' semantics: contrastive learning and chain-of-thought reasoning. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed strategies and also reveal that there remains a large space for improvement in Ultra-ESE.

Abstract: In this study, we reveal an in-context learning (ICL) capability of multilingual large language models (LLMs): by translating the input to several languages, we provide Parallel Input in Multiple Languages (PiM) to LLMs, which significantly enhances their comprehension abilities. To test this capability, we design extensive experiments encompassing 8 typical datasets, 7 languages and 8 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs. Experimental results show that (1) incorporating more languages help PiM surpass the conventional ICL further; (2) even combining with the translations that are inferior to baseline performance can also help. Moreover, by examining the activated neurons in LLMs, we discover a counterintuitive but interesting phenomenon. Contrary to the common thought that PiM would activate more neurons than monolingual input to leverage knowledge learned from diverse languages, PiM actually inhibits neurons and promotes more precise neuron activation especially when more languages are added. This phenomenon aligns with the neuroscience insight about synaptic pruning, which removes less used neural connections, strengthens remainders, and then enhances brain intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Gemini underscores the intense demand for resources during their training processes, posing significant challenges due to substantial computational and environmental costs. To alleviate this issue, we propose checkpoint merging in pretraining LLM. This method utilizes LLM checkpoints with shared training trajectories, and is rooted in an extensive search space exploration for the best merging weight via Bayesian optimization. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that: (1) Our proposed methodology exhibits the capacity to augment pretraining, presenting an opportunity akin to obtaining substantial benefits at minimal cost; (2) Our proposed methodology, despite requiring a given held-out dataset, still demonstrates robust generalization capabilities across diverse domains, a pivotal aspect in pretraining.

Abstract: Self-correction is emerging as a promising approach to mitigate the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in sign language video processing, including the task of sign to written language translation, is how we learn representations of sign language in an effective and efficient way that preserves the important attributes of these languages, while remaining invariant to irrelevant visual differences. Informed by the nature and linguistics of signed languages, our proposed method focuses on just the most relevant parts in a signing video: the face, hands and body pose of the signer. However, instead of fully relying on pose estimation from off-the-shelf pose tracking models, which have inconsistent performance for hands and faces, we propose to learn a representation of the complex handshapes and facial expressions of sign languages in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach is based on learning from individual frames (rather than video sequences) and is therefore much more efficient than prior work on sign language pre-training. Compared to a recent model that established a new state of the art in sign language translation on the How2Sign dataset, our approach yields similar translation performance, using less than 3\% of the compute.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems empower users to interact with databases using natural language, automatically translating queries into executable SQL code. However, their reliance on database schema information for SQL generation exposes them to significant security vulnerabilities, particularly schema inference attacks that can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a novel zero-knowledge framework for reconstructing the underlying database schema of text-to-SQL models without any prior knowledge of the database. Our approach systematically probes text-to-SQL models with specially crafted questions and leverages a surrogate GPT-4 model to interpret the outputs, effectively uncovering hidden schema elements -- including tables, columns, and data types. We demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy in reconstructing table names, with F1 scores of up to .99 for generative models and .78 for fine-tuned models, underscoring the severity of schema leakage risks. We also show that our attack can steal prompt information in non-text-to-SQL models. Furthermore, we propose a simple protection mechanism for generative models and empirically show its limitations in mitigating these attacks.

Abstract: Free-text rationales justify model decisions in natural language and thus become likable and accessible among approaches to explanation across many tasks. However, their effectiveness can be hindered by misinterpretation and hallucination. As a perturbation test, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) perform rationale generation under the effects of readability level control, i.e., being prompted for an explanation targeting a specific expertise level, such as sixth grade or college. We find that explanations are adaptable to such instruction, though the observed distinction between readability levels does not fully match the defined complexity scores according to traditional readability metrics. Furthermore, the generated rationales tend to feature medium level complexity, which correlates with the measured quality using automatic metrics. Finally, our human annotators confirm a generally satisfactory impression on rationales at all readability levels, with high-school-level readability being most commonly perceived and favored.

Abstract: This paper introduces UnSeenTimeQA, a novel data contamination-free time-sensitive question-answering (TSQA) benchmark. It differs from existing TSQA benchmarks by avoiding web-searchable queries grounded in the real world. We present a series of time-sensitive event scenarios based on synthetically generated facts. It requires large language models (LLMs) to engage in genuine temporal reasoning without depending on the factual knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. Our data generation framework enables on-demand generation of new samples, mitigating the risk of data leakage. We designed three types of time-sensitive questions to test LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over sequential and parallel event occurrences. Our evaluation of five LLMs on synthetic fact-based TSQA reveals mixed results: while they perform well on simpler subsets, their overall performance remains inferior as compared to real world fact-based TSQA. Error analysis indicates that LLMs face difficulties in reasoning over long-range event dependencies and parallel events.

Abstract: Long-form question answering (LFQA) aims to provide thorough and in-depth answers to complex questions, enhancing comprehension. However, such detailed responses are prone to hallucinations and factual inconsistencies, challenging their faithful evaluation. This work introduces HaluQuestQA, the first hallucination dataset with localized error annotations for human-written and model-generated LFQA answers. HaluQuestQA comprises 698 QA pairs with 1.8k span-level error annotations for five different error types by expert annotators, along with preference judgments. Using our collected data, we thoroughly analyze the shortcomings of long-form answers and find that they lack comprehensiveness and provide unhelpful references. We train an automatic feedback model on this dataset that predicts error spans with incomplete information and provides associated explanations. Finally, we propose a prompt-based approach, Error-informed refinement, that uses signals from the learned feedback model to refine generated answers, which we show reduces errors and improves answer quality across multiple models. Furthermore, humans find answers generated by our approach comprehensive and highly prefer them (84%) over the baseline answers.

Abstract: This research addresses the issue of missing structured data in dental records by extracting diagnostic information from unstructured text. The updated periodontology classification system's complexity has increased incomplete or missing structured diagnoses. To tackle this, we use advanced AI and NLP methods, leveraging GPT-4 to generate synthetic notes for fine-tuning a RoBERTa model. This significantly enhances the model's ability to understand medical and dental language. We evaluated the model using 120 randomly selected clinical notes from two datasets, demonstrating its improved diagnostic extraction accuracy. The results showed high accuracy in diagnosing periodontal status, stage, and grade, with Site 1 scoring 0.99 and Site 2 scoring 0.98. In the subtype category, Site 2 achieved perfect scores, outperforming Site 1. This method enhances extraction accuracy and broadens its use across dental contexts. The study underscores AI and NLP's transformative impact on healthcare delivery and management. Integrating AI and NLP technologies enhances documentation and simplifies administrative tasks by precisely extracting complex clinical information. This approach effectively addresses challenges in dental diagnostics. Using synthetic training data from LLMs optimizes the training process, improving accuracy and efficiency in identifying periodontal diagnoses from clinical notes. This innovative method holds promise for broader healthcare applications, potentially improving patient care quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, they occasionally generate inaccurate and counterfactual outputs, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "hallucinations''. To tackle this issue, recent studies have explored contrastive decoding between the original model and an amateur model with induced hallucination, showing promising results. Nevertheless, this approach can disrupt the original LLM's output distribution due to coarse contrast and simple subtraction operations, potentially leading to errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive decoding framework, termed LOL (LOwer Layer Matters). Unlike prior methods that focus solely on the final layer, our approach integrates contrastive information from lower layers to enable multi-layer fusion during contrastive decoding. Additionally, we incorporate a truthfulness refocused module that leverages instruction guidance to further improve truthfulness in contrastive decoding. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that the LOL framework significantly mitigates hallucination while outperforming existing baselines in most cases. For reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, capturing the attention of both practitioners and the broader public. A key question that now preoccupies the AI community concerns the capabilities and limitations of these models, with trustworthiness emerging as a central issue, particularly as LLMs are increasingly applied in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance, where errors can have serious consequences. However, most previous studies on the trustworthiness of LLMs have been limited to a single language, typically the predominant one in the dataset, such as English. In response to the growing global deployment of LLMs, we introduce XTRUST, the first comprehensive multilingual trustworthiness benchmark. XTRUST encompasses a diverse range of topics, including illegal activities, hallucination, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, physical and mental health, toxicity, fairness, misinformation, privacy, and machine ethics, across 10 different languages. Using XTRUST, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the multilingual trustworthiness of five widely used LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across languages and tasks. Our results indicate that many LLMs struggle with certain low-resource languages, such as Arabic and Russian, highlighting the considerable room for improvement in the multilingual trustworthiness of current language models. The code is available at https://github.com/LluckyYH/XTRUST.

Abstract: The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are applied across diverse domains, the ability to selectively unlearn specific information is becoming increasingly essential. For instance, LLMs are expected to selectively provide confidential information to authorized internal users, such as employees or trusted partners, while withholding it from external users, including the general public and unauthorized entities. Therefore, we propose a novel method termed ``in-context knowledge unlearning'', which enables the model to selectively forget information in test-time based on the query context. Our method fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to enable prompt unlearning of target knowledge within the context, while preserving unrelated information. Experiments on TOFU, AGE and RWKU datasets using Llama2-7B/13B and Mistral-7B models demonstrate that our method achieves up to 95% forget accuracy while retaining 80% of unrelated knowledge, significantly outperforming baselines in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Further investigation of the model's internal behavior revealed that while fine-tuned LLMs generate correct predictions in the middle layers and preserve them up to the final layer. However, the decision to forget is made only at the last layer, i.e. ``LLMs pretend to forget''. Our findings offer valuable insight into the improvement of the robustness of the unlearning mechanisms in LLMs, laying a foundation for future research in the field.

Abstract: Robust, diverse, and challenging cultural knowledge benchmarks are essential for measuring our progress towards making LMs that are helpful across diverse cultures. We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,696 human-written and human-verified questions to assess LMs' cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. Questions are each verified by five independent annotators and span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquette. We construct CulturalBench using methods inspired by Human-AI Red-Teaming. Compared to human performance (92.4% accuracy), the hard version of CulturalBench is challenging even for the best-performing frontier LMs, ranging from 28.7% to 61.5% in accuracy. We find that LMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to overfit to a single answer. Our results indicate that GPT-4o substantially outperform other models across cultures, besting local providers (e.g., Mistral on European culture and DeepSeek on Chinese culture). Across the board, models under-perform on questions related to North Africa, South America and Middle East.

Abstract: Text-based image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3, hold significant potential in content creation and publishing workflows, making them the focus in recent years. Despite their remarkable capability to generate diverse and vivid images, considerable efforts are being made to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as abusive, violent, or pornographic material. To assess the safety of existing models, we introduce a novel jailbreaking method called Chain-of-Jailbreak (CoJ) attack, which compromises image generation models through a step-by-step editing process. Specifically, for malicious queries that cannot bypass the safeguards with a single prompt, we intentionally decompose the query into multiple sub-queries. The image generation models are then prompted to generate and iteratively edit images based on these sub-queries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CoJ attack method, we constructed a comprehensive dataset, CoJ-Bench, encompassing nine safety scenarios, three types of editing operations, and three editing elements. Experiments on four widely-used image generation services provided by GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 1.5 Pro, demonstrate that our CoJ attack method can successfully bypass the safeguards of models for over 60% cases, which significantly outperforms other jailbreaking methods (i.e., 14%). Further, to enhance these models' safety against our CoJ attack method, we also propose an effective prompting-based method, Think Twice Prompting, that can successfully defend over 95% of CoJ attack. We release our dataset and code to facilitate the AI safety research.

<title>Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, efficient evaluation metrics are vital for assessing their ability to compress information and reduce redundancy. While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable insights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to their \( O(n^3) \) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only serves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also provides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive discriminability and diversity. By employing the \( L_{1,2}\text{-norm} \) to further approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's information compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity to \( O(n^2) \) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the Matrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy for the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This performance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in tests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks and model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a reliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MatrixNuclearNorm.

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE)-the automatic assessment of translation quality-has recently become crucial across several stages of the translation pipeline, from data curation to training and decoding. While QE metrics have been optimized to align with human judgments, whether they encode social biases has been largely overlooked. Biased QE risks favoring certain demographic groups over others, e.g., by exacerbating gaps in visibility and usability. This paper defines and investigates gender bias of QE metrics and discusses its downstream implications for machine translation (MT). Experiments with state-of-the-art QE metrics across multiple domains, datasets, and languages reveal significant bias. When a human entity's gender in the source is undisclosed, masculine-inflected translations score higher than feminine-inflected ones, and gender-neutral translations are penalized. Even when contextual cues disambiguate gender, using context-aware QE metrics leads to more errors in selecting the correct translation inflection for feminine referents than for masculine ones. Moreover, a biased QE metric affects data filtering and quality-aware decoding. Our findings underscore the need for a renewed focus on developing and evaluating QE metrics centered on gender.

Abstract: Instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) under 14B parameters continue to underperform on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, often trailing smaller models like BERT-base on benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE. Motivated by the success of reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks (e.g., DeepSeek), we explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a framework to improve the NLU capabilities of LLMs. We frame NLU as a reinforcement learning environment, treating token generation as a sequence of actions and optimizing for reward signals based on alignment with ground-truth labels. PPO consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning, yielding an average improvement of 6.3 points on GLUE, and surpasses zero-shot and few-shot prompting by 38.7 and 26.1 points, respectively. Notably, PPO-tuned models outperform GPT-4o by over 4\% on average across sentiment and natural language inference tasks, including gains of 7.3\% on the Mental Health dataset and 10.9\% on SIGA-nli. This work highlights a promising direction for adapting LLMs to new tasks by reframing them as reinforcement learning problems, enabling learning through simple end-task rewards rather than extensive data curation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools capable of handling diverse tasks. Comparing and selecting appropriate LLMs for specific tasks requires systematic evaluation methods, as models exhibit varying capabilities across different domains. However, finding suitable benchmarks is difficult given the many available options. This complexity not only increases the risk of benchmark misuse and misinterpretation but also demands substantial effort from LLM users, seeking the most suitable benchmarks for their specific needs. To address these issues, we introduce \texttt{BenchmarkCards}, an intuitive and validated documentation framework that standardizes critical benchmark attributes such as objectives, methodologies, data sources, and limitations. Through user studies involving benchmark creators and users, we show that \texttt{BenchmarkCards} can simplify benchmark selection and enhance transparency, facilitating informed decision-making in evaluating LLMs. Data & Code: https://github.com/SokolAnn/BenchmarkCards

Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, we lack satisfying formal definitions for it that are measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. We hope that our definition can inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought. We make our code available at https://github.com/EricElmoznino/complexity_compositionality.

Abstract: While post-training compression techniques effectively reduce the memory footprint, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), they often result in noticeable accuracy degradation and remain limited by hardware and kernel constraints that restrict supported compression formats ultimately reducing flexibility across a wide range of deployment scenarios. In this work, we propose EoRA, a novel fine-tuning-free method that augments compressed LLMs with low-rank matrices, allowing users to rapidly enhance task-specific performance and freely balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational overhead beyond the constraints of compression formats. EoRA consistently outperforms prior training-free low rank methods in recovering the accuracy of compressed LLMs, achieving notable accuracy improvements (e.g., $\mathbf{10.84\%}$ on ARC-Challenge, $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on MathQA, and $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on GSM8K) for LLaMA3-8B compressed to 3-bit. We also introduce an optimized CUDA kernel, accelerating inference by up to 1.4x and reducing memory overhead through quantizing EoRA. Overall, EoRA offers a prompt solution for improving the accuracy of compressed models under varying user requirements, enabling more efficient and flexible deployment of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/EoRA.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a crucial technique for aligning language models with human preferences, playing a pivotal role in the success of conversational models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Llama 2. A core challenge in employing RLHF lies in training a reliable reward model (RM), which relies on high-quality labels typically provided by human experts or advanced AI system. These methods can be costly and may introduce biases that affect the language model's responses. As language models improve, human input may become less effective in further enhancing their performance. In this paper, we propose Self-Evolved Reward Learning (SER), a novel approach where the RM generates additional training data to iteratively improve itself. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets such as HH-RLHF and UltraFeedback, using models like Mistral and Llama 3, and compare SER against various baselines. Our results demonstrate that even with limited human-annotated data, learning from self-feedback can robustly enhance RM performance, thereby boosting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically employs an utterance selection method within a single textual modality to locate causal utterances. This approach remains limited to coarse-grained assessments, lacks nuanced explanations of emotional causation, and demonstrates inadequate capability in identifying multimodal emotional triggers. Therefore, we introduce a task-\textbf{Multimodal Emotion Cause Explanation in Conversation (MECEC)}. This task aims to generate a summary based on the multimodal context of conversations, clearly and intuitively describing the reasons that trigger a given emotion. To adapt to this task, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) based on the MELD dataset. ECEM combines video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, helping to explore the causal factors behind emotional expression in multimodal conversations. A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net outperforms several excellent baselines. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3222345200/FAME-Net.

Abstract: When comparing the linguistic capabilities of language models (LMs) with humans using LM probabilities, factors such as the length of the sequence and the unigram frequency of lexical items have a significant effect on LM probabilities in ways that humans are largely robust to. Prior works in comparing LM and human acceptability judgments treat these effects uniformly across models, making a strong assumption that models require the same degree of adjustment to control for length and unigram frequency effects. We propose MORCELA, a new linking theory between LM scores and acceptability judgments where the optimal level of adjustment for these effects is estimated from data via learned parameters for length and unigram frequency. We first show that MORCELA outperforms a commonly used linking theory for acceptability - SLOR (Pauls and Klein, 2012; Lau et al. 2017) - across two families of transformer LMs (Pythia and OPT). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the assumed degrees of adjustment in SLOR for length and unigram frequency overcorrect for these confounds, and that larger models require a lower relative degree of adjustment for unigram frequency, though a significant amount of adjustment is still necessary for all models. Finally, our subsequent analysis shows that larger LMs' lower susceptibility to frequency effects can be explained by an ability to better predict rarer words in context.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling. SuffixDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference.

Abstract: The advanced role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled rich interactive scenarios, yet existing research in social interactions neglects hallucination while struggling with poor generalizability and implicit character fidelity judgments. To bridge this gap, motivated by human behaviour, we introduce a generalizable and explicit paradigm for uncovering interactive patterns of LLMs across diverse worldviews. Specifically, we first define interactive hallucination through stance transfer, then construct SHARP, a benchmark built by extracting relations from commonsense knowledge graphs and utilizing LLMs' inherent hallucination properties to simulate multi-role interactions. Extensive experiments confirm our paradigm's effectiveness and stability, examine the factors that influence these metrics, and challenge conventional hallucination mitigation solutions. More broadly, our work reveals a fundamental limitation in popular post-training methods for role-playing LLMs: the tendency to obscure knowledge beneath style, resulting in monotonous yet human-like behaviors - interactive hallucination.

Abstract: The recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope of multimodal applications. However, evaluations often remain limited to functional tasks, neglecting abstract dimensions such as personality traits and human values. To address this gap, we introduce Value-Spectrum, a novel Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark aimed at assessing VLMs based on Schwartz's value dimensions that capture core human values guiding people's preferences and actions. We design a VLM agent pipeline to simulate video browsing and construct a vector database comprising over 50,000 short videos from TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. These videos span multiple months and cover diverse topics, including family, health, hobbies, society, technology, etc. Benchmarking on Value-Spectrum highlights notable variations in how VLMs handle value-oriented content. Beyond identifying VLMs' intrinsic preferences, we also explore the ability of VLM agents to adopt specific personas when explicitly prompted, revealing insights into the adaptability of the model in role-playing scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of Value-Spectrum as a comprehensive evaluation set for tracking VLM preferences in value-based tasks and abilities to simulate diverse personas. The complete code and data are available at: https://github.com/Jeremyyny/Value-Spectrum.

Abstract: Sign language processing has traditionally relied on task-specific models, limiting the potential for transfer learning across tasks. Pre-training methods for sign language have typically focused on either supervised pre-training, which cannot take advantage of unlabeled data, or context-independent (frame or video segment) representations, which ignore the effects of relationships across time in sign language. We introduce SHuBERT (Sign Hidden-Unit BERT), a self-supervised contextual representation model learned from approximately 1,000 hours of American Sign Language video. SHuBERT adapts masked token prediction objectives to multi-stream visual sign language input, learning to predict multiple targets corresponding to clustered hand, face, and body pose streams. SHuBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks including sign language translation, isolated sign language recognition, and fingerspelling detection.

Abstract: A significant debate has emerged in response to a paper written by Steven Piantadosi (Piantadosi, 2023) and uploaded to the LingBuzz platform, the open archive for generative linguistics. Piantadosi's dismissal of Chomsky's approach is ruthless, but generative linguists deserve it. In this paper, I will adopt three idealized perspectives -- computational, theoretical, and experimental -- to focus on two fundamental issues that lend partial support to Piantadosi's critique: (a) the evidence challenging the Poverty of Stimulus (PoS) hypothesis and (b) the notion of simplicity as conceived within mainstream Minimalism. In conclusion, I argue that, to reclaim a central role in language studies, generative linguistics -- representing a prototypical theoretical perspective on language -- needs a serious update leading to (i) more precise, consistent, and complete formalizations of foundational intuitions and (ii) the establishment and utilization of a standardized dataset of crucial empirical evidence to evaluate the theory's adequacy. On the other hand, ignoring the formal perspective leads to major drawbacks in both computational and experimental approaches. Neither descriptive nor explanatory adequacy can be easily achieved without the precise formulation of general principles that can be challenged empirically.

Abstract: Interpreting the internal process of neural models has long been a challenge. This challenge remains relevant in the era of large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL); for example, ICL poses a new issue of interpreting which example in the few-shot examples contributed to identifying/solving the task. To this end, in this paper, we design synthetic diagnostic tasks of inductive reasoning, inspired by the generalization tests typically adopted in psycholinguistics. Here, most in-context examples are ambiguous w.r.t. their underlying rule, and one critical example disambiguates it. The question is whether conventional input attribution (IA) methods can track such a reasoning process, i.e., identify the influential example, in ICL. Our experiments provide several practical findings; for example, a certain simple IA method works the best, and the larger the model, the generally harder it is to interpret the ICL with gradient-based IA methods.

Abstract: This work presents a computational approach to analyze character development along the narrative timeline. The analysis characterizes the inner and outer changes the protagonist undergoes within a narrative, and the interplay between them. We consider transcripts of Holocaust survivor testimonies as a test case, each telling the story of an individual in first-person terms. We focus on the survivor's religious trajectory, examining the evolution of their disposition toward religious belief and practice along the testimony. Clustering the resulting trajectories in the dataset, we identify common sequences in the data. Our findings highlight multiple common structures of religiosity across the narratives: in terms of belief, most present a constant disposition, while for practice, most present an oscillating structure, serving as valuable material for historical and sociological research. This work demonstrates the potential of natural language processing techniques for analyzing character evolution through thematic trajectories in narratives.

Abstract: Self-evolving trainin--where models iteratively learn from their own outputs--has emerged as a key approach for complex reasoning tasks, addressing the scarcity of high-quality chain-of-thought data. However, its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning, remains underexplored, and the understanding of critical factors in this training paradigm remains limited. Furthermore, a central challenge for this training method is performance saturation, which impedes further improvements and scalability. Inspired by reinforcement learning (RL), in this paper, we reframe self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning through the lens of RL, identifying three pivotal factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. Through systematic analysis, we establish relatively optimal design principles that significantly enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities. Moreover, delving deeper into training dynamics, we uncover the roots of saturation and propose a new automatic balancing mechanism to mitigate this limitation. Building on these insights, we propose M-STAR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), a framework that achieves consistent performance gains across models of varying sizes and diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: The surge in online content has created an urgent demand for robust detection systems, especially in non-English contexts where current tools demonstrate significant limitations. We present forePLay, a novel Polish language dataset for erotic content detection, featuring over 24k annotated sentences with a multidimensional taxonomy encompassing ambiguity, violence, and social unacceptability dimensions. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that specialized Polish language models achieve superior performance compared to multilingual alternatives, with transformer-based architectures showing particular strength in handling imbalanced categories. The dataset and accompanying analysis establish essential frameworks for developing linguistically-aware content moderation systems, while highlighting critical considerations for extending such capabilities to morphologically complex languages.

<title>Instruction-Following Pruning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: With the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs), structured pruning has become a widely used technique to learn efficient, smaller models from larger ones, delivering superior performance compared to training similarly sized models from scratch. In this paper, we move beyond the traditional static pruning approach of determining a fixed pruning mask for a model, and propose a dynamic approach to structured pruning. In our method, the pruning mask is input-dependent and adapts dynamically based on the information described in a user instruction. Our approach, termed "instruction-following pruning", introduces a sparse mask predictor that takes the user instruction as input and dynamically selects the most relevant model parameters for the given task. To identify and activate effective parameters, we jointly optimize the sparse mask predictor and the LLM, leveraging both instruction-following data and the pre-training corpus. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks. For example, our 3B activated model improves over the 3B dense model by 5-8 points of absolute margin on domains such as math and coding, and rivals the performance of a 9B model.

Abstract: Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs. However, recent work~\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that DPO training \textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead \textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced hyperparameter fixed. Additionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct and incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.

arXiv:2501.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new finetuning method to provide pre-trained large language models (LMs) the ability to scale test-time compute through the diffusion framework. By increasing the number of diffusion steps, we show our finetuned models achieve monotonically increasing accuracy, directly translating to improved performance across downstream tasks. Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics. However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/UGPhysics .

Abstract: Self-attention in transformer models is an incremental associative memory that maps key vectors to value vectors. One way to speed up self-attention is to employ GPU-compatible vector search algorithms based on standard partitioning methods such as k-means. However, such partitioning methods yield poor results in this context because (1) the keys and queries follow different distributions, and (2) the RoPE positional encoding hinders the bucket assignment.
  This paper introduces Saap (Self-Attention with Asymmetric Partitions), which overcomes these problems. It is an asymmetrical indexing technique that employs distinct partitions for keys and queries, thereby approximating self-attention with a data-adaptive sparsity pattern. It works on pretrained language models and only requires to train (offline) a small query classifier. On a long context Llama 3.1-8b model, with sequences ranging from 100k to 500k tokens, Saap typically reduces by a factor of 20 the fraction of memory that needs to be looked-up, which translates to a time saving of 60\% when compared to FlashAttention-v2.

<title>Rethinking Evaluation Metrics for Grammatical Error Correction: Why Use a Different Evaluation Process than Human?</title>

Abstract: One of the goals of automatic evaluation metrics in grammatical error correction (GEC) is to rank GEC systems such that it matches human preferences. However, current automatic evaluations are based on procedures that diverge from human evaluation. Specifically, human evaluation derives rankings by aggregating sentence-level relative evaluation results, e.g., pairwise comparisons, using a rating algorithm, whereas automatic evaluation averages sentence-level absolute scores to obtain corpus-level scores, which are then sorted to determine rankings. In this study, we propose an aggregation method for existing automatic evaluation metrics which aligns with human evaluation methods to bridge this gap. We conducted experiments using various metrics, including edit-based metrics, n-gram based metrics, and sentence-level metrics, and show that resolving the gap improves results for the most of metrics on the SEEDA benchmark. We also found that even BERT-based metrics sometimes outperform the metrics of GPT-4. The proposed ranking method is integrated gec-metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Akan Conversation Emotion (ACE) dataset, the first multimodal emotion dialogue dataset for an African language, addressing the significant lack of resources for low-resource languages in emotion recognition research. ACE, developed for the Akan language, contains 385 emotion-labeled dialogues and 6,162 utterances across audio, visual, and textual modalities, along with word-level prosodic prominence annotations. The presence of prosodic labels in this dataset also makes it the first prosodically annotated African language dataset. We demonstrate the quality and utility of ACE through experiments using state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods, establishing solid baselines for future research. We hope ACE inspires further work on inclusive, linguistically and culturally diverse NLP resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and semantic understanding. However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose NumericBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate six fundamental numerical capabilities: number recognition, arithmetic operations, contextual retrieval, comparison, summary, and logical reasoning. NumericBench includes datasets ranging from synthetic number lists to the crawled real-world data, addressing challenges like long contexts, noise, and multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4 and DeepSeek, reveal persistent weaknesses in numerical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need to improve numerically-aware language modeling. The benchmark is released in: https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/NumericBench.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded the capabilities of traditional language models by enabling interaction through both text and images. However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe-a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness-prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning-but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area. All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have serious security vulnerabilities.While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM's security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA.

Abstract: Long context large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient serving due to the large memory footprint and high access overhead of KV cache. Retrieval-based KV cache reduction methods can mitigate these challenges, typically by offloading the complete KV cache to CPU and retrieving necessary tokens on demand during inference. However, these methods still suffer from unsatisfactory accuracy degradation and extra retrieval overhead. To address these limitations, this paper proposes A$^2$ATS, a novel retrieval-based KV cache reduction method. A$^2$ATS aims to obtain an accurate approximation of attention scores by applying the vector quantization technique to key states, thereby enabling efficient and precise retrieval of the top-K tokens. First, we propose Windowed Rotary Position Embedding, which decouples the positional dependency from query and key states after position embedding. Then, we propose query-aware vector quantization that optimizes the objective of attention score approximation directly. Finally, we design the heterogeneous inference architecture for KV cache offloading, enabling long context serving with larger batch sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that A$^2$ATS can achieve a lower performance degradation with similar or lower overhead compared to existing methods, thereby increasing long context serving throughput by up to $2.7 \times$.

Abstract: Query-driven recommendation with unknown items poses a challenge for users to understand why certain items are appropriate for their needs. Query-driven Contrastive Summarization (QCS) is a methodology designed to address this issue by leveraging language-based item descriptions to clarify contrasts between them. However, existing state-of-the-art contrastive summarization methods such as STRUM-LLM fall short of this goal. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Q-STRUM Debate, a novel extension of STRUM-LLM that employs debate-style prompting to generate focused and contrastive summarizations of item aspects relevant to a query. Leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) as powerful tools for generating debates, Q-STRUM Debate provides enhanced contrastive summaries. Experiments across three datasets demonstrate that Q-STRUM Debate yields significant performance improvements over existing methods on key contrastive summarization criteria, thus introducing a novel and performant debate prompting methodology for QCS.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pre-trained visual-language models (VLMs) to a range of downstream tasks. While optimizing the context can be effective for improving performance on specific tasks, it can often lead to poor generalization performance on unseen classes or datasets sampled from different distributions. It may be attributed to the fact that textual prompts tend to overfit downstream data distributions, leading to the forgetting of generalized knowledge derived from hand-crafted prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Similarity Paradigm with Textual Regularization (SPTR) for prompt learning without forgetting. SPTR is a two-pronged design based on hand-crafted prompts that is an inseparable framework. 1) To avoid forgetting general textual knowledge, we introduce the optimal transport as a textual regularization to finely ensure approximation with hand-crafted features and tuning textual features. 2) In order to continuously unleash the general ability of multiple hand-crafted prompts, we propose a similarity paradigm for natural alignment score and adversarial alignment score to improve model robustness for generalization. Both modules share a common objective in addressing generalization issues, aiming to maximize the generalization capability derived from multiple hand-crafted prompts. Four representative tasks (i.e., non-generalization few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset generalization, domain generalization) across 11 datasets demonstrate that SPTR outperforms existing prompt learning methods.

Abstract: Social reasoning abilities are crucial for AI systems to effectively interpret and respond to multimodal human communication and interaction within social contexts. We introduce SOCIAL GENOME, the first benchmark for fine-grained, grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. SOCIAL GENOME contains 272 videos of interactions and 1,486 human-annotated reasoning traces related to inferences about these interactions. These traces contain 5,777 reasoning steps that reference evidence from visual cues, verbal cues, vocal cues, and external knowledge (contextual knowledge external to videos). SOCIAL GENOME is also the first modeling challenge to study external knowledge in social reasoning. SOCIAL GENOME computes metrics to holistically evaluate semantic and structural qualities of model-generated social reasoning traces. We demonstrate the utility of SOCIAL GENOME through experiments with state-of-the-art models, identifying performance gaps and opportunities for future research to improve the grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined automation for effective task management, yet many AI frameworks fall short due to inadequate operational expertise. While manually written knowledge can bridge this gap, it is often burdensome and inefficient.

By deriving knowledge directly from video content, Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the effort and time required for knowledge acquisition. To rigorously evaluate this approach, we propose Mobile-Knowledge, a benchmark tailored to assess the impact of external knowledge on mobile agent performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-V enhances performance by 36% compared to existing methods, underscoring its effortless and efficient advantages in mobile automation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on Llama Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZBox1005/CoT-UQ.

Abstract: LLM-based Interactive Drama is a novel AI-based dialogue scenario, where the user (i.e. the player) plays the role of a character in the story, has conversations with characters played by LLM agents, and experiences an unfolding story. This paper begins with understanding interactive drama from two aspects: Immersion, the player's feeling of being present in the story, and Agency, the player's ability to influence the story world. Both are crucial to creating an enjoyable interactive experience, while they have been underexplored in previous work. To enhance these two aspects, we first propose Playwriting-guided Generation, a novel method that helps LLMs craft dramatic stories with substantially improved structures and narrative quality. Additionally, we introduce Plot-based Reflection for LLM agents to refine their reactions to align with the player's intentions. Our evaluation relies on human judgment to assess the gains of our methods in terms of immersion and agency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong effectiveness and robustness while fine-tuned as dense retrievers. However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. In this work, we introduce DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, we adopt pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) showcase increasingly impressive English benchmark scores, however their performance profiles remain inconsistent across multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce PolyPrompt, a novel, parameter-efficient framework for enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. Our method learns a set of trigger tokens for each language through a gradient-based search, identifying the input query's language and selecting the corresponding trigger tokens which are prepended to the prompt during inference. We perform experiments on two ~1 billion parameter models, with evaluations on the global MMLU benchmark across fifteen typologically and resource diverse languages, demonstrating accuracy gains of 3.7%-19.9% compared to naive and translation-pipeline baselines.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, and prior research shows that CoT can theoretically increase expressiveness. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of the algorithms that Transformer+CoT can learn. Our key contributions are: (1) We evaluate the state tracking capabilities of Transformer+CoT and its variants, confirming the effectiveness of CoT. (2) Next, we identify the circuit (a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state), indicating that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model. (3) Additionally, we explore three challenging settings: skipping intermediate steps, introducing data noises, and testing length generalization. Our results demonstrate that Transformer+CoT learns robust algorithms (FSAs), highlighting its resilience in challenging scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/IvanChangPKU/FSA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been observed to process non-human-readable text sequences, such as jailbreak prompts, often viewed as a bug for aligned LLMs. In this work, we present a systematic investigation challenging this perception, demonstrating that unnatural languages - strings that appear incomprehensible to humans but maintain semantic meanings for LLMs - contain latent features usable by models. Notably, unnatural languages possess latent features that can be generalized across different models and tasks during inference. Furthermore, models fine-tuned on unnatural versions of instruction datasets perform on-par with those trained on natural language, achieving 49.71 win rates in Length-controlled AlpacaEval 2.0 in average across various base models. In addition, through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs process unnatural languages by filtering noise and inferring contextual meaning from filtered words.

<title>Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback Framework for Large Language Model Agent</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically adopt a step-by-step reasoning framework, in which they interleave the processes of thinking and acting to accomplish the given task. However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.

Abstract: Dense retrieval models are commonly used in Information Retrieval (IR) applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Since they often serve as the first step in these systems, their robustness is critical to avoid downstream failures. In this work, we repurpose a relation extraction dataset (e.g., Re-DocRED) to design controlled experiments that quantify the impact of heuristic biases, such as a preference for shorter documents, on retrievers like Dragon+ and Contriever. We uncover major vulnerabilities, showing retrievers favor shorter documents, early positions, repeated entities, and literal matches, all while ignoring the answer's presence! Notably, when multiple biases combine, models exhibit catastrophic performance degradation, selecting the answer-containing document in less than 10% of cases over a synthetic biased document without the answer. Furthermore, we show that these biases have direct consequences for downstream applications like RAG, where retrieval-preferred documents can mislead LLMs, resulting in a 34% performance drop than providing no documents at all. https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohsenfayyaz/ColDeR

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, aligning them with human preferences remains an open challenge. Although current alignment methods rely primarily on explicit feedback, eye-tracking (ET) data offers insights into real-time cognitive processing during reading. In this paper, we present OASST-ETC, a novel eye-tracking corpus capturing reading patterns from 24 participants, while evaluating LLM-generated responses from the OASST1 dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct reading patterns between preferred and non-preferred responses, which we compare with synthetic eye-tracking data. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human reading measures and attention patterns from various transformer-based models, discovering stronger correlations in preferred responses. This work introduces a unique resource for studying human cognitive processing in LLM evaluation and suggests promising directions for incorporating eye-tracking data into alignment methods. The dataset and analysis code are publicly available.

<title>The time scale of redundancy between prosody and linguistic context</title>

Abstract: In spoken communication, information is transmitted not only via words, but also through a rich array of non-verbal signals, including prosody--the non-segmental auditory features of speech. Do these different communication channels carry distinct information? Prior work has shown that the information carried by prosodic features is substantially redundant with that carried by the surrounding words. Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this relationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future contexts. We find that a word's prosodic features require an extended past context (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given that long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate communication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a word's prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with a short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term planning in language production. Thus, prosody may facilitate communication by helping listeners predict upcoming material. In tandem, our results highlight potentially distinct roles that prosody plays in facilitating integration of words into past contexts and in helping predict upcoming words.

Abstract: Common subword tokenization algorithms like BPE and UnigramLM assume that text can be split into meaningful units by concatenative measures alone. This is not true for languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, where morphology is encoded in root-template patterns, or Malay and Georgian, where split affixes are common. We present SPLINTER, a pre-processing step which rearranges text into a linear form that better represents such nonconcatenative morphologies, enabling meaningful contiguous segments to be found by the tokenizer. We demonstrate SPLINTER's merit using both intrinsic measures evaluating token vocabularies in Hebrew, Arabic, and Malay; as well as on downstream tasks using BERT-architecture models trained for Hebrew.

Abstract: Children acquire language despite being exposed to several orders of magnitude less data than large language models require. Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to integrate human-like learning biases into neural-network architectures, combining both the structured generalizations of symbolic models with the scalability of neural-network models. But what does meta-learning exactly imbue the model with? We investigate the meta-learning of formal languages and find that, contrary to previous claims, meta-trained models are not learning simplicity-based priors when meta-trained on datasets organised around simplicity. Rather, we find evidence that meta-training imprints neural mechanisms (such as counters) into the model, which function like cognitive primitives for the network on downstream tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that meta-training on a single formal language can provide as much improvement to a model as meta-training on 5000 different formal languages, provided that the formal language incentivizes the learning of useful neural mechanisms. Taken together, our findings provide practical implications for efficient meta-learning paradigms and new theoretical insights into linking symbolic theories and neural mechanisms.

Abstract: Whether large language models (LLMs) process language similarly to humans has been the subject of much theoretical and practical debate. We examine this question through the lens of the production-interpretation distinction found in human sentence processing and evaluate the extent to which instruction-tuned LLMs replicate this distinction. Using an empirically documented asymmetry between pronoun production and interpretation in humans for implicit causality verbs as a testbed, we find that some LLMs do quantitatively and qualitatively reflect human-like asymmetries between production and interpretation. We demonstrate that whether this behavior holds depends upon both model size-with larger models more likely to reflect human-like patterns and the choice of meta-linguistic prompts used to elicit the behavior. Our codes and results are available at https://github.com/LingMechLab/Production-Interpretation_Asymmetries_ACL2025.

Abstract: Negations are key to determining sentence meaning, making them essential for logical reasoning. Despite their importance, negations pose a substantial challenge for large language models (LLMs) and remain underexplored.
  We constructed and published two new textual entailment datasets NoFEVER-ML and NoSNLI-ML in four languages (English, Czech, German, and Ukrainian) with
  examples differing in negation. It allows investigation of the root causes of the negation problem and its exemplification: how popular LLM model properties and language impact their inability to handle negation correctly.
  Contrary to previous work, we show that increasing the model size may improve the models' ability to handle negations. Furthermore, we find that both the models' reasoning accuracy and robustness to negation are language-dependent and that the length and explicitness of the premise have an impact on robustness. There is better accuracy in projective language with fixed order, such as English, than in non-projective ones, such as German or Czech.
  Our entailment datasets pave the way to further research for explanation and exemplification of the negation problem, minimization of LLM hallucinations, and improvement of LLM reasoning in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Data annotation is an essential component of the machine learning pipeline; it is also a costly and time-consuming process. With the introduction of transformer-based models, annotation at the document level is increasingly popular; however, there is no standard framework for structuring such tasks. The EffiARA annotation framework is, to our knowledge, the first project to support the whole annotation pipeline, from understanding the resources required for an annotation task to compiling the annotated dataset and gaining insights into the reliability of individual annotators as well as the dataset as a whole. The framework's efficacy is supported by two previous studies: one improving classification performance through annotator-reliability-based soft-label aggregation and sample weighting, and the other increasing the overall agreement among annotators through removing identifying and replacing an unreliable annotator. This work introduces the EffiARA Python package and its accompanying webtool, which provides an accessible graphical user interface for the system. We open-source the EffiARA Python package at https://github.com/MiniEggz/EffiARA and the webtool is publicly accessible at https://effiara.gate.ac.uk.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating discourse annotation for conversations. While manually designing tree annotation schemes significantly improves annotation quality for humans and models, their creation remains time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. We propose a fully automated pipeline that uses LLMs to construct such schemes and perform annotation. We evaluate our approach on speech functions (SFs) and the Switchboard-DAMSL (SWBD-DAMSL) taxonomies. Our experiments compare various design choices, and we show that frequency-guided decision trees, paired with an advanced LLM for annotation, can outperform previously manually designed trees and even match or surpass human annotators while significantly reducing the time required for annotation. We release all code and resultant schemes and annotations to facilitate future research on discourse annotation.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO, the first integration of policy gradient methods to masked dLLMs. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and planning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM. Our code is released at https://dllm-reasoning.github.io/.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.

Abstract: Mamba's theoretical infinite-context potential is limited in practice when sequences far exceed training lengths. This work explores unlocking Mamba's long-context memory ability by a simple-yet-effective method, Recall with Reasoning (RwR), by distilling chain-of-thought (CoT) summarization from a teacher model. Specifically, RwR prepends these summarization as CoT prompts during fine-tuning, teaching Mamba to actively recall and reason over long contexts. Experiments on LONGMEMEVAL and HELMET show RwR boosts Mamba's long-context performance against comparable Transformer/hybrid baselines under similar pretraining conditions, while preserving short-context capabilities, all without architectural changes.

Abstract: We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition. Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset \cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Each year, tens of millions of essays are written and graded in college-level English courses. Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts through a process known as close reading, in which they gather textual details to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models (LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331 multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external contexts. Our baseline results find that, while state-of-the-art LLMs possess some college-level close reading competency (accuracy 49.7% - 69.7%), their performances still trail those of experienced human evaluators on 10 out of our 11 tasks.

Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization, particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter) LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL) curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system. This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1, on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered, progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench}, a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

Abstract: Multi-hop question generation (MQG) aims to generate questions that require synthesizing multiple information snippets from documents to derive target answers. The primary challenge lies in effectively pinpointing crucial information snippets related to question-answer (QA) pairs, typically relying on keywords. However, existing works fail to fully utilize the guiding potential of keywords and neglect to differentiate the distinct roles of question-specific and document-specific keywords. To address this, we define dual-perspective keywords (i.e., question and document keywords) and propose a Dual-Perspective Keyword-Guided (DPKG) framework, which seamlessly integrates keywords into the multi-hop question generation process. We argue that question keywords capture the questioner's intent, whereas document keywords reflect the content related to the QA pair. Functionally, question and document keywords work together to pinpoint essential information snippets in the document, with question keywords required to appear in the generated question. The DPKG framework consists of an expanded transformer encoder and two answer-aware transformer decoders for keyword and question generation, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, showcasing its promising performance and underscoring its significant value in the MQG task.

<title>Ranking Free RAG: Replacing Re-ranking with Selection in RAG for Sensitive Domains</title>

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach. METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance, global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation. The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to 0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating strong resilience to poisoning attacks.

<title>Think Silently, Think Fast: Dynamic Latent Compression of LLM Reasoning Chains</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to: i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8% performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models' classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

Abstract: High-quality long-context instruction data is essential for aligning long-context large language models (LLMs). Despite the public release of models like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary. Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn, auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER, and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse, and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.

<title>On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law</title>

Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.

Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model, confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

<title>VRAG-RL: Empower Vision-Perception-Based RAG for Visually Rich Information Understanding via Iterative Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.

Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.

Abstract: Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is increasing the scale and complexity of ransomware attacks. Understanding the internal operations behind RaaS has been a challenge due to the illegality of such activities. The recent chat leak of the Conti RaaS operator, one of the most infamous ransomware operators on the international scene, offers a key opportunity to better understand the inner workings of such organizations. This paper analyzes the main topic discussions in the Conti chat leak using machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), as well as visualization strategies. Five discussion topics are found: 1) Business, 2) Technical, 3) Internal tasking/Management, 4) Malware, and 5) Customer Service/Problem Solving. Moreover, the distribution of topics among Conti members shows that only 4% of individuals have specialized discussions while almost all individuals (96%) are all-rounders, meaning that their discussions revolve around the five topics. The results also indicate that a significant proportion of Conti discussions are non-tech related. This study thus highlights that running such large RaaS operations requires a workforce skilled beyond technical abilities, with individuals involved in various tasks, from management to customer service or problem solving. The discussion topics also show that the organization behind the Conti RaaS oper5086933ator shares similarities with a large firm. We conclude that, although RaaS represents an example of specialization in the cybercrime industry, only a few members are specialized in one topic, while the rest runs and coordinates the RaaS operation.

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5\% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/MCU.

arXiv:2402.15319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we show that the size versus accuracy trade-off of neural network quantization can be significantly improved by increasing the quantization dimensionality. We propose the GPTVQ method, a new fast method for post-training vector quantization (VQ) that scales well to Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method interleaves quantization of one or more columns with updates to the remaining unquantized weights, using information from the Hessian of the per-layer output reconstruction MSE. Quantization codebooks are initialized using an efficient data-aware version of the EM algorithm. The codebooks are then updated, and further compressed by using integer quantization and SVD-based compression. GPTVQ establishes a new state-of-the art in the size vs accuracy trade-offs on a wide range of LLMs such as Llama-v2 and Mistral. Furthermore, our method is efficient: on a single H100 it takes between 3 and 11 hours to process a Llamav2-70B model, depending on quantization setting. Lastly, with on-device timings for VQ decompression on a mobile CPU we show that VQ leads to improved latency compared to using a 4-bit integer format.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires a time-consuming search for adversarial prompts, whereas automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that do not scale well. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds. AdvPrompter, which is trained using an alternating optimization algorithm, generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show highly competitive results on the AdvBench and HarmBench datasets, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLMs. We also show that training on adversarial suffixes generated by AdvPrompter is a promising strategy for improving the robustness of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict the loss of a target machine learning model by extrapolating from easier-to-train models with fewer parameters or smaller training sets. This provides an efficient way for practitioners and researchers alike to compare pretraining decisions involving optimizers, datasets, and model architectures. Despite the widespread use of scaling laws to model the dynamics of language model training, there has been little work on understanding how to best estimate and interpret them. We collect (and release) a large-scale dataset containing losses and downstream evaluations for 485 previously published pretrained models. We use these to estimate more than 1000 scaling laws, then derive a set of best practices for estimating scaling laws in new model families. We find that fitting scaling laws to intermediate checkpoints of training runs (and not just their final losses) substantially improves accuracy, and that -- all else equal -- estimates of performance are generally most accurate when derived from other models of similar sizes. However, because there is a significant degree of variability across model seeds, training multiple small models is sometimes more useful than training a single large one. Moreover, while different model families differ scaling behavior, they are often similar enough that a target model's behavior can be predicted from a single model with the same architecture, along with scaling parameter estimates derived from other model families.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance rapidly, rigorous evaluation has become essential, providing further guidance for their development. In this work, we focus on a unified and robust evaluation of \textbf{vision perception} abilities, the foundational skill of MLLMs. We find that existing perception benchmarks, each focusing on different question types, domains, and evaluation metrics, introduce significant evaluation variance, complicating comprehensive assessments of perception abilities when relying on any single benchmark. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AbilityLens}, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in six key perception abilities (ranging from counting, OCR, to understanding structural data), focusing on both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse types of questions, domains, and metrics. With the assistance of AbilityLens, we: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of current main-stream MLLMs, highlighting stability patterns and revealing a notable performance gap between state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models; (2) uncover interesting ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during MLLM training; (3) reveal the primary reason of ability conflict is data mixing ratio and LLM model size; and (4) discuss the effectiveness of some straightforward strategies \eg, fine-tuning and model merging, to solve the ability conflict. The benchmark and online leaderboard is released in https://github.com/Chenfeng1271/AbilityLens.

Abstract: A seminal paper published by Ledley and Lusted in 1959 introduced complex clinical diagnostic reasoning cases as the gold standard for the evaluation of expert medical computing systems, a standard that has held ever since. Here, we report the results of a physician evaluation of a large language model (LLM) on challenging clinical cases against a baseline of hundreds of physicians. We conduct five experiments to measure clinical reasoning across differential diagnosis generation, display of diagnostic reasoning, triage differential diagnosis, probabilistic reasoning, and management reasoning, all adjudicated by physician experts with validated psychometrics. We then report a real-world study comparing human expert and AI second opinions in randomly-selected patients in the emergency room of a major tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA. We compared LLMs and board-certified physicians at three predefined diagnostic touchpoints: triage in the emergency room, initial evaluation by a physician, and admission to the hospital or intensive care unit. In all experiments--both vignettes and emergency room second opinions--the LLM displayed superhuman diagnostic and reasoning abilities, as well as continued improvement from prior generations of AI clinical decision support. Our study suggests that LLMs have achieved superhuman performance on general medical diagnostic and management reasoning, fulfilling the vision put forth by Ledley and Lusted, and motivating the urgent need for prospective trials.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, but their safety alignment remain a major concern. Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.

Abstract: Understanding training dynamics and feature evolution is crucial for the mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs). Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to identify features within LLMs, a clear picture of how these features evolve during training remains elusive. In this study, we (1) introduce SAE-Track, a novel method for efficiently obtaining a continual series of SAEs, providing the foundation for a mechanistic study that covers (2) the semantic evolution of features, (3) the underlying processes of feature formation, and (4) the directional drift of feature vectors. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of features in LLMs, enhancing our understanding of training mechanisms and feature evolution. For reproducibility, our code is available at https://github.com/Superposition09m/SAE-Track.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal Language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts, pushing the frontiers of the omni-modal language model to a large extent. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of architectural design, data curation, and training strategies essential for building a robust omni-modal model. Ola incorporates advanced visual understanding and audio recognition capabilities through several critical and effective improvements over mainstream baselines. Moreover, we rethink inter-modal relationships during omni-modal training, emphasizing cross-modal alignment with video as a central bridge, and propose a progressive training pipeline that begins with the most distinct modalities and gradually moves towards closer modality alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.

Abstract: Many commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) are often closed-source, limiting developers to prompt tuning for aligning content generation with specific applications. While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to Plugin model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.

<title>Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization: Aligning Vision-Language Models with Minimal Contrastive Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations. We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details. To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks. Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency. In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities. We opensource our code at https://s-vco.github.io/

arXiv:2502.14354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Alignment (MOA) aims to align LLMs' responses with multiple human preference objectives, with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) emerging as a prominent approach. However, we find that DPO-based MOA approaches suffer from widespread preference conflicts in the data, where different objectives favor different responses. This results in conflicting optimization directions, hindering the optimization on the Pareto Front. To address this, we propose to construct Pareto-optimal responses to resolve preference conflicts. To efficiently obtain and utilize such responses, we propose a self-improving DPO framework that enables LLMs to self-generate and select Pareto-optimal responses for self-supervised preference alignment. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superior Pareto Front achieved by our framework compared to various baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/zyttt-coder/SIPO.

<title>A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos</title>

arXiv:2502.15806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, Claude-Sonnet and Gemini-Thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking Claude-Sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively. Attention: This paper contains inappropriate, offensive and harmful content.

Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring factuality of content generation.

arXiv:2502.18017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant challenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/ViDoRAG.

<title>We Should Chart an Atlas of All the World's Models</title>

arXiv:2503.10633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public model repositories now contain millions of models, yet most models remain undocumented and effectively lost. In this position paper, we advocate for charting the world's model population in a unified structure we call the Model Atlas: a graph that captures models, their attributes, and the weight transformations that connect them. The Model Atlas enables applications in model forensics, meta-ML research, and model discovery, challenging tasks given today's unstructured model repositories. However, because most models lack documentation, large atlas regions remain uncharted. Addressing this gap motivates new machine learning methods that treat models themselves as data, inferring properties such as functionality, performance, and lineage directly from their weights. We argue that a scalable path forward is to bypass the unique parameter symmetries that plague model weights. Charting all the world's models will require a community effort, and we hope its broad utility will rally researchers toward this goal.

Abstract: Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case, they correspond to a \emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \emph{soft} attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality.

<title>Enhancing Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models Through Saliency-Aware Partial Retraining</title>

Abstract: The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85\% and 7.54\% respectively.

Abstract: Recent developments in prompt learning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in target-specific tasks. However, these prompting methods often struggle to tackle the target-unspecific or generalizable tasks effectively. It may be attributed to the fact that overfitting training causes the model to forget its general knowledge. The general knowledge has a strong promotion on target-unspecific tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Features Matrix (FM) approach designed to enhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and leverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the FM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective, preserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of overfitting. Representative evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the FM is compatible with existing frameworks as a generic and flexible module, and 2) the FM significantly showcases its effectiveness in enhancing target-unspecific tasks (base-to-novel generalization, domain generalization, and cross-dataset generalization), achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations, highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined automation for effective task management, yet many AI frameworks fall short due to inadequate operational expertise. While manually written knowledge can bridge this gap, it is often burdensome and inefficient. We introduce Mobile-Agent-V, an innovative framework that utilizes video as a guiding tool to effortlessly and efficiently inject operational knowledge into mobile automation processes. By deriving knowledge directly from video content, Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the effort and time required for knowledge acquisition. To rigorously evaluate this approach, we propose Mobile-Knowledge, a benchmark tailored to assess the impact of external knowledge on mobile agent performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-V enhances performance by 36% compared to existing methods, underscoring its effortless and efficient advantages in mobile automation.

arXiv:2505.16932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Abstract: Publicly significant images from events hold valuable contextual information, crucial for journalism and education. However, existing methods often struggle to extract this relevance accurately. To address this, we introduce GETReason (Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework that moves beyond surface-level image descriptions to infer deeper contextual meaning. We propose that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information enhances understanding of an image's significance. Additionally, we introduce GREAT (Geospatial Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal Alignment), a new metric for evaluating reasoning-based image understanding. Our layered multi-agent approach, assessed using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that meaningful insights can be inferred, effectively linking images to their broader event context.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection. However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g., recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) -- which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based ("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question) evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a challenging task. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit.

Abstract: The development of high-performing, robust, and reliable speech technologies depends on large, high-quality datasets. However, African languages -- including our focus, Igbo, Hausa, and Yoruba -- remain under-represented due to insufficient data. Popular voice-enabled technologies do not support any of the 2000+ African languages, limiting accessibility for circa one billion people. While previous dataset efforts exist for the target languages, they lack the scale and diversity needed for robust speech models. To bridge this gap, we introduce the NaijaVoices dataset, a 1,800-hour speech-text dataset with 5,000+ speakers. We outline our unique data collection approach, analyze its acoustic diversity, and demonstrate its impact through finetuning experiments on automatic speech recognition, averagely achieving 75.86% (Whisper), 52.06% (MMS), and 42.33% (XLSR) WER improvements. These results highlight NaijaVoices' potential to advance multilingual speech processing for African languages.

<div> perception accuracy, reasoning length, hallucination, multimodal tasks, attention analysis

Summary:<br /><br /> The study explores the trade-off between reasoning ability and perceptual fidelity in multimodal large language models. Longer reasoning chains in these models lead to increased hallucination, as they drift away from image-grounded content and rely more on language priors. The RH-AUC metric quantifies how model perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, revealing that larger models achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception. The study introduces RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for multimodal tasks, to assess this trade-off. It is found that the balance between reasoning and perception is influenced more by the types and domains of training data rather than its volume. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluation frameworks that consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

Summary: 
The article introduces RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework that combines a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms to evaluate computer-use agents (CUAs) for potential vulnerabilities related to indirect prompt injection. The framework allows for flexible adversarial scenario configuration and bypasses navigational limitations of CUAs by initiating tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Through the development of RTC-Bench, a benchmark with 864 examples, the study identifies significant vulnerabilities in current CUAs, with ASRs ranging from 7.6% to 50%. The results show that even advanced CUAs are susceptible to indirect prompt injection, highlighting the need for robust defenses in the face of realistic hybrid web-OS attack scenarios. RedTeamCUA provides a crucial tool for comprehensive analysis of CUA vulnerabilities and emphasizes the importance of addressing these risks before real-world deployment. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) promise to automate complex tasks across operating systems (OS) and the web, but remain vulnerable to indirect prompt injection. Current evaluations of this threat either lack support realistic but controlled environments or ignore hybrid web-OS attack scenarios involving both interfaces. To address this, we propose RedTeamCUA, an adversarial testing framework featuring a novel hybrid sandbox that integrates a VM-based OS environment with Docker-based web platforms. Our sandbox supports key features tailored for red teaming, such as flexible adversarial scenario configuration, and a setting that decouples adversarial evaluation from navigational limitations of CUAs by initializing tests directly at the point of an adversarial injection. Using RedTeamCUA, we develop RTC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 864 examples that investigate realistic, hybrid web-OS attack scenarios and fundamental security vulnerabilities. Benchmarking current frontier CUAs identifies significant vulnerabilities: Claude 3.7 Sonnet | CUA demonstrates an ASR of 42.9%, while Operator, the most secure CUA evaluated, still exhibits an ASR of 7.6%. Notably, CUAs often attempt to execute adversarial tasks with an Attempt Rate as high as 92.5%, although failing to complete them due to capability limitations. Nevertheless, we observe concerning ASRs of up to 50% in realistic end-to-end settings, with the recently released frontier Claude 4 Opus | CUA showing an alarming ASR of 48%, demonstrating that indirect prompt injection presents tangible risks for even advanced CUAs despite their capabilities and safeguards. Overall, RedTeamCUA provides an essential framework for advancing realistic, controlled, and systematic analysis of CUA vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses to indirect prompt injection prior to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Evaluating tables qualitatively and quantitatively poses a significant challenge, as standard metrics often overlook subtle structural and content-level discrepancies. To address this, we propose a rubric-based evaluation framework that integrates multi-level structural descriptors with fine-grained contextual signals, enabling more precise and consistent table comparison. Building on this, we introduce TabXEval, an eXhaustive and eXplainable two-phase evaluation framework. TabXEval first aligns reference and predicted tables structurally via TabAlign, then performs semantic and syntactic comparison using TabCompare, offering interpretable and granular feedback. We evaluate TabXEval on TabXBench, a diverse, multi-domain benchmark featuring realistic table perturbations and human annotations. A sensitivity-specificity analysis further demonstrates the robustness and explainability of TabXEval across varied table tasks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a systematic approach, JQL, for curating high-quality multilingual training data for large language models, efficiently reducing computational demands. Using lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings, the approach improves cross-lingual transferability and scalability. JQL's annotation pipeline outperforms heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2 across 35 languages, enhancing downstream model training quality and data retention rates.

Abstract: High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.

Summary:
Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) is an AI-in-the-loop methodology aimed at optimizing human annotation efforts for vision-language alignment. It leverages sequential annotation to reduce redundant workload by having subsequent annotators focus only on missing visual information. By utilizing a multimodal interface that allows annotators to read and talk simultaneously, CoTalk increases annotation speed and improves the comprehensiveness of annotated samples. Intrinsic evaluations show the effectiveness of CoTalk in producing comprehensive semantic units, while extrinsic evaluations demonstrate its practical utility in aiding vision-language alignment. Experiments with participants have shown that CoTalk leads to faster annotation speeds and better retrieval performance compared to conventional parallel annotation methods. This innovative framework has the potential to maximize the number of annotated samples and enhance their quality within fixed budget constraints.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While densely annotated image captions significantly facilitate the learning of robust vision-language alignment, methodologies for systematically optimizing human annotation efforts remain underexplored. We introduce Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk), an AI-in-the-loop methodology designed to maximize the number of annotated samples and improve their comprehensiveness under fixed budget constraints (e.g., total human annotation time). The framework is built upon two key insights. First, sequential annotation reduces redundant workload compared to conventional parallel annotation, as subsequent annotators only need to annotate the ``residual'' -- the missing visual information that previous annotations have not covered. Second, humans process textual input faster by reading while outputting annotations with much higher throughput via talking; thus a multimodal interface enables optimized efficiency. We evaluate our framework from two aspects: intrinsic evaluations that assess the comprehensiveness of semantic units, obtained by parsing detailed captions into object-attribute trees and analyzing their effective connections; extrinsic evaluation measures the practical usage of the annotated captions in facilitating vision-language alignment. Experiments with eight participants show our Chain-of-Talkers (CoTalk) improves annotation speed (0.42 vs. 0.30 units/sec) and retrieval performance (41.13% vs. 40.52%) over the parallel method.

Summary:<br /><br />Recent research has focused on improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. While current methods operate at the token level, LLMs still experience hallucinations, particularly in longer contexts. To address this, Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD) is introduced as a novel decoding strategy that actively determines when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By treating decoding as a sequential decision-making process, ActLCD uses reinforcement learning to optimize factuality beyond individual tokens. Experimental results demonstrate ActLCD outperforms existing techniques across multiple benchmarks, proving its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations in various generation scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses the challenges of aligning large language models with human preferences, highlighting the multifaceted nature of preference feedback. It introduces SITAlign, a framework that implements the concept of satisficing alignment by optimizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. Drawing from research on bounded rationality, which suggests humans follow satisficing strategies in decision-making, the framework aims to reflect how humans actually make decisions. The theoretical analysis includes sub-optimality bounds for the satisficing-based inference alignment approach. Empirical validation on various benchmarks shows that SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective decoding strategy, demonstrating superior performance in maximizing helpfulness while adhering to harmlessness thresholds. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.

Abstract: Foundation model-based agents are increasingly used to automate complex tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity. However, their access to sensitive resources and autonomous decision-making also introduce significant security risks, where successful attacks could lead to severe consequences. To systematically uncover these vulnerabilities, we propose AdvAgent, a black-box red-teaming framework for attacking web agents. Unlike existing approaches, AdvAgent employs a reinforcement learning-based pipeline to train an adversarial prompter model that optimizes adversarial prompts using feedback from the black-box agent. With careful attack design, these prompts effectively exploit agent weaknesses while maintaining stealthiness and controllability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AdvAgent achieves high success rates against state-of-the-art GPT-4-based web agents across diverse web tasks. Furthermore, we find that existing prompt-based defenses provide only limited protection, leaving agents vulnerable to our framework. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current web agents and emphasize the urgent need for stronger defense mechanisms. We release code at https://ai-secure.github.io/AdvAgent/.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, pruning, regional gradients, perplexity improvement, lightweight approach

Summary:
The article introduces Wanda++, a new pruning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that utilizes decoder-block-level regional gradients to enhance the pruning process. By incorporating regional gradients for the first time, Wanda++ effectively minimizes output discrepancies between dense and sparse decoder outputs, resulting in improved accuracy without the need for full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. In language modeling tasks, Wanda++ surpasses existing methods by up to a 32% improvement in perplexity and demonstrates strong generalization to downstream tasks. Despite its regional optimization approach, Wanda++ remains compatible with sparsity-aware fine-tuning techniques like LoRA, further reducing perplexity to a great extent. This lightweight framework can prune a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU, making it efficient for practical usage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal accuracy impact. However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level \textbf{regional} gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32\% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation (HiREC) framework to address the issue of duplicate retrieval in standardized financial documents. By performing hierarchical retrieval and evidence curation, HiREC reduces confusion among similar texts and selects relevant passages while removing irrelevant ones. The framework also generates complementary queries to gather missing information. To evaluate the approach, the authors introduce a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin) question answering benchmark consisting of SEC documents and question-answer pairs. The benchmark aims to improve accuracy and completeness in knowledge-intensive tasks utilizing large language models in the finance domain. The code and data for LOFin are publicly available on GitHub, offering a valuable resource for further research in this area. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based large language models (LLMs) are widely used in finance for their excellent performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats such as repetitive boilerplate texts, and similar table structures. This similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text, leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial (LOFin) question answering benchmark that includes 145,897 SEC documents and 1,595 question-answer pairs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/deep-over/LOFin-bench-HiREC.

<div> Variable binding, symbolic computation, neural networks, dereferencing, attention<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This study explores how a Transformer model can acquire the ability to handle variable bindings in symbolic programs without explicit architectural support. Through training on programs with variable assignments and chains of dependencies, the model goes through three training phases: random prediction, heuristic prioritization, and systematic dereferencing. By analyzing causal interventions, the researchers find that the model leverages residual streams as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to track variable bindings across layers, enabling accurate dereferencing. The results demonstrate how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding, bridging the gap between connectionist and symbolic approaches. The Variable Scope platform was also developed to facilitate reproducible research and exploration of the findings. <div>
arXiv:2505.20896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variable binding -- the ability to associate variables with values -- is fundamental to symbolic computation and cognition. Although classical architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and (3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support, bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches. To facilitate reproducible research, we developed Variable Scope, an interactive web platform for exploring our findings at https://variablescope.org

Summary:<br />
Distill CLIP (DCLIP) is a variant of the CLIP model designed to improve image-text retrieval while maintaining strong zero-shot classification abilities. DCLIP uses a meta teacher-student distillation approach, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned to generate enhanced embeddings through bidirectional cross-attention between image regions and text. By training on a smaller dataset, DCLIP significantly enhances retrieval metrics and retains most of CLIP's classification performance. This approach effectively balances task specialization and generalization, offering a resource-efficient solution for advanced vision-language tasks.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.21549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Distill CLIP (DCLIP), a fine-tuned variant of the CLIP model that enhances multimodal image-text retrieval while preserving the original model's strong zero-shot classification capabilities. CLIP models are typically constrained by fixed image resolutions and limited context, which can hinder their effectiveness in retrieval tasks that require fine-grained cross-modal understanding. DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student distillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned to produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between YOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans. These semantically and spatially aligned global representations guide the training of a lightweight student model using a hybrid loss that combines contrastive learning and cosine similarity objectives. Despite being trained on only ~67,500 samples curated from MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Conceptual Captions-just a fraction of CLIP's original dataset-DCLIP significantly improves image-text retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MAP), while retaining approximately 94% of CLIP's zero-shot classification performance. These results demonstrate that DCLIP effectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and generalization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and detail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks.

Abstract: AI copilots represent a new generation of AI-powered systems designed to assist users, particularly knowledge workers and developers, in complex, context-rich tasks. As these systems become more embedded in daily workflows, personalization has emerged as a critical factor for improving usability, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the system's ability to detect, interpret, and align with individual user preferences. While prior work in intelligent assistants and optimization algorithms is extensive, their intersection within AI copilots remains underexplored. This survey addresses that gap by examining how user preferences are operationalized in AI copilots. We investigate how preference signals are sourced, modeled across different interaction stages, and refined through feedback loops. Building on a comprehensive literature review, we define the concept of an AI copilot and introduce a taxonomy of preference optimization techniques across pre-, mid-, and post-interaction phases. Each technique is evaluated in terms of advantages, limitations, and design implications. By consolidating fragmented efforts across AI personalization, human-AI interaction, and language model adaptation, this work offers both a unified conceptual foundation and a practical design perspective for building user-aligned, persona-aware AI copilots that support end-to-end adaptability and deployment.

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present SWE-bench-Live, a live-updatable benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.

<div> Keywords: rule-based reinforcement learning, multimodal large language models, jigsaw puzzles, generalization, visual tasks

Summary: 
Firstly, multimodal large language models show significant improvement in jigsaw puzzle solving through fine-tuning. They can achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize well to complex configurations. Secondly, training on jigsaw puzzles can lead to generalization on other visual tasks, depending on the task configurations. Thirdly, MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, but there may be a tendency to favor direct answering in open-source models. Complex reasoning patterns seem to be pre-existing rather than emergent, increasing in frequency with training and task difficulty. Finally, rule-based reinforcement learning exhibits more effective generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning, but an initial cold start phase with SFT may hinder subsequent optimization in RL. Overall, this study sheds light on the unique challenges and potential in rule-based visual RL in multimodal learning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile, physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue. Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the field of physics.

Summary:
This study examines the effectiveness of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. The analysis considers various perspectives such as training methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. The findings suggest that there is a diminishing return in performance as the PRM scale increases, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and computational cost. The diversity of training datasets significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the need for varied data. Test-time scaling strategies, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N Sampling, are identified as effective methods based on available computational resources. PRMs trained on mathematical datasets show comparable performance to those trained for code generation, indicating robust cross-domain generalization. Additionally, the study reveals that PRMs have a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying patterns, providing insights for optimization. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models have underscored the efficacy of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in addressing intermediate errors through structured feedback mechanisms. This study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. Our analysis reveals a pattern of diminishing returns in performance with increasing PRM scale, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and computational cost. Furthermore, the diversity of training datasets significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse data to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. We further examine test-time scaling strategies, identifying Monte Carlo Tree Search as the most effective method when computational resources are abundant, while Best-of-N Sampling serves as a practical alternative under resource-limited conditions. Notably, our findings indicate that PRMs trained on mathematical datasets exhibit performance comparable to those tailored for code generation, suggesting robust cross-domain generalization. Employing a gradient-based metric, we observe that PRMs exhibit a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying patterns, further informing their optimization.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, tool calling errors, Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist, parameter-filling accuracy, natural language processing

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist (HiTEC) framework to address parameter misfilling issues in large language models (LLMs) when calling external tools. This framework consists of a global error checklist for common issues and a local checklist for tool-specific failures. Two deployments are proposed: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL uses a conversational approach to refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates negative examples for optimization. Experimental results on public datasets show that HiTEC significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods. This framework offers a systematic way to diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors without extensive real-world interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs. However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

<div> social influence, taxonomy, techniques, LLMs, dialogue

Summary: 
The study introduces the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a framework consisting of 58 techniques categorized into nine groups to identify subtle social influence in text. The researchers create the SITT dataset, a corpus of 746 dialogues annotated by 11 experts in Polish and translated into English. Five large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on their ability to recognize social influence techniques, with Claude 3.5 showing moderate success. However, the overall performance of LLMs is limited, especially for context-sensitive techniques. The study highlights the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and emphasizes the models' lack of sensitivity to nuanced linguistic cues. This work serves as a valuable resource for exploring how LLMs perceive and categorize social influence strategies in natural dialogues.

Abstract: In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in natural dialogues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner, with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios, explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper, our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset. Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs' proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal language models, reference words, possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, perspective-taking

Summary: 
Multimodal language models (MLMs) were evaluated on their use of reference words compared to human performance. Three word classes - vocabulary words, possessive pronouns, and demonstrative pronouns - were tested, revealing that MLMs struggle with possessives and demonstratives due to limitations in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning. While MLMs showed improvement with prompt engineering on possessive use, they remained below human-level competence in using demonstrative pronouns. These findings highlight the challenges faced by current NLP systems in producing grammatical forms that require pragmatics and social cognition. This study contributes both theoretical and empirical evidence to the ongoing discussion about the capabilities of MLMs in understanding and producing human-like communication.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task, they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a clear challenge in current NLP systems.

arXiv:2506.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social (libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks.

Summary:<br />
- Popular benchmarks do not adequately assess large language models in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.
- A new set of benchmarks varying context volume and nature was introduced.
- LLM performance on multiple-choice questions can significantly decrease in multi-turn exchanges.
- Even highly capable models like GPT-4o may exhibit reduced accuracy.
- Performance differences between larger and smaller models are not always predictable.
- Strategic placement of the task description within context can improve accuracy significantly. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks, focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude, and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable. Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

<br />Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools that can mimic human behavior and capabilities. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows LLMs to generate varied outputs based on their database contents, making them valuable for studying human behavior in social science research where large experiments are impractical. In this paper, the use of interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to LLMs is explored. The study compares a simplified GMM model to experimental simulations of interacting LLMs, showing that interacting GMMs can capture dynamics similar to interacting LLMs. Key similarities and differences between the two models are investigated, highlighting the potential of GMMs in modeling complex interactions. The benefits, possible modifications, and future research directions for GMMs are also discussed. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, refusal behaviors, COSMIC, steering directions, alignment conditions
Summary: 
The article introduces COSMIC, an automated framework for identifying viable steering directions and target layers in Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on specific refusal templates detectable in model outputs. COSMIC utilizes cosine similarity metrics for direction selection, achieving comparable steering performance to existing methods while being independent of model outputs. It can reliably identify refusal directions in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, steering them toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals. The framework demonstrates robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions, showcasing its ability to enhance the safety and behavior of LLMs without requiring assumptions about their refusal behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce \textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals, demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

Summary:
Code-switching is the practice of alternating between two or more languages within a conversation, presenting a challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition systems designed for single languages. To address this issue, LinguaMaster presents SwitchLingua, a diverse dataset featuring 420K code-switching textual samples in 12 languages and over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers across 18 countries and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds. This dataset aims to support multilingual and multicultural research by capturing linguistic and cultural diversity. Additionally, the proposed Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER) evaluation metric incorporates semantic information to provide a more accurate assessment of system performance in code-switching scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech (CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.
  Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate \textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12 languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity, offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the \textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware assessment of system performance.

Summary:  
Hallucination, the production of inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs). Current classification-based methods struggle to detect non-factual information early in the output sequence, reducing reliability. To address this, a novel method called Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs) is proposed. It assesses statement truthfulness by capturing LLM dynamics in the latent space using neural differential equations (Neural DEs). The latent space sequence is then mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. Extensive experiments across datasets and LLMs show HD-NDEs' effectiveness, achieving a significant improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to existing techniques. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Verifiable Rewards, Creative Writing, Generative Reward Model, Policy Optimization

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been successful in tasks with objective ground-truth answers, but faces challenges in subjective tasks like creative writing. This paper introduces a new approach that bridges the gap between verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. The proposed method combines a pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) based on writing principles with a Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. This allows for transforming subjective assessments into reliable rewards and enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison during training. The approach aims to improve writing capabilities of large language models without supervised fine-tuning and shows resistance to reward hacking. Experimental results on writing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. This work opens up possibilities for a unified reward modeling framework in reinforcement learning for language tasks.

arXiv:2506.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation. However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.

This article discusses the importance of extracting social determinants of health (SDOH) from clinical text for healthcare analytics. It highlights the challenges faced when using large language models (LLMs), such as relying on superficial cues that can lead to inaccurate predictions. The study focuses on drug status extraction and reveals how mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely influence models to predict drug use where there is none, as well as uncovering gender disparities in model performance.

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

Abstract: Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences. Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized approaches based on open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Our results show that incorporating the personalized context provided leads to performance improvements of up to 39%. The benchmark is publicly released to support future research in this area.

Abstract: Sanskrit, an ancient language with a rich linguistic heritage, presents unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to its phonemic complexity and the phonetic transformations that occur at word junctures, similar to the connected speech found in natural conversations. Due to these complexities, there has been limited exploration of ASR in Sanskrit, particularly in the context of its poetic verses, which are characterized by intricate prosodic and rhythmic patterns. This gap in research raises the question: How can we develop an effective ASR system for Sanskrit, particularly one that captures the nuanced features of its poetic form? In this study, we introduce Vedavani, the first comprehensive ASR study focused on Sanskrit Vedic poetry. We present a 54-hour Sanskrit ASR dataset, consisting of 30,779 labelled audio samples from the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. This dataset captures the precise prosodic and rhythmic features that define the language. We also benchmark the dataset on various state-of-the-art multilingual speech models.$^{1}$ Experimentation revealed that IndicWhisper performed the best among the SOTA models.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS) models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy, reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals. Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent, offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and sustained user engagement.

Summary:
- Radiology reports often lack standardized formats, hindering both human interpretability and machine learning applications.
- Lightweight encoder-decoder models like T5 and BERT2BERT show promise in structuring radiology reports from datasets like MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus.
- These models outperform larger language models adapted using prompt-based techniques on human-annotated test sets.

arXiv:2506.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning (ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%, GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Summary: <br />
Accurate intent classification is crucial for effective customer service routing, improving connection between customers and agents while reducing time and cost. However, scalability issues arise with expanding product lines, leading to challenges in handling the increasing number of intents and taxonomy variations. The REIC approach, which combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology, addresses these challenges by dynamically incorporating relevant knowledge for precise intent classification without the need for frequent retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that REIC surpasses traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service applications. It proves effective in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, showcasing its potential for deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting, Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure. Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity. Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

Abstract: Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover, in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical decision-making.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in various NLP tasks, but their reliability in critical domains like medicine, especially in low-resource languages such as Persian, is not well studied. The PersianMedQA dataset, containing expert-validated multiple-choice medical questions in Persian and English, was introduced to assess LLMs' performance. Over 40 state-of-the-art models were tested, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) scenarios. General models like GPT-4.1 outperformed others, achieving high accuracy in both languages. Persian fine-tuned models struggled with domain reasoning and instruction-following, while the impact of translation on performance was also analyzed. Despite larger model sizes, robust performance required strong domain and language adaptation. PersianMedQA establishes a basis for evaluating multilingual and culturally informed medical reasoning in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA

<div> implicit bias, language models, racial concepts, bias mitigation, model representation <br />
Summary: <br />
The study delves into the discrepancy between explicit and implicit bias evaluations in value-aligned language models. While these models appear unbiased in explicit assessments, they exhibit stereotypes in implicit associations. The research reveals that alignment can amplify implicit bias in model outputs by overlooking racial concepts in early internal representations when facing ambiguous contexts. This lack of representation fails to activate safety mechanisms, leading to unintended biases. By incentivizing the early model layers to incorporate racial concepts, a new bias mitigation strategy is proposed. Contrary to conventional approaches like machine unlearning, this method focuses on increasing the model's awareness of race, thus effectively mitigating implicit bias. Similar to the concept of race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in language models. <div>

Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks, raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

<div> Keywords: large language models, hiring processes, fairness, demographic information, disability bias

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly used in hiring processes, where candidates often provide demographic information like gender, race, disability, or veteran status. This data is collected for diversity and inclusion efforts but presents concerns about bias in candidate selection when fed to LLMs. While previous studies have shown how disability can affect CV screening, this study specifically examines the impact of voluntarily disclosed disability information on LLM-driven candidate selection. In cases where candidates had identical qualifications and backgrounds but differed in disability status, LLMs consistently favored those who stated they did not have a disability over those who did not disclose their disability status or stated they had a disability. This bias was observed even in job roles with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without disabilities, such as Cashiers or Software Developers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs, especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have a disability.

Summary:
Large Language Models are being increasingly used in critical domains, emphasizing the need for them to detect false assumptions and engage in critical reasoning. Existing benchmarks focus on single-hop false-premise questions, but real-world scenarios often require multi-hop inference for verifying consistency across multiple reasoning steps. To address this gap, the MultiHoax benchmark is introduced. This dataset encompasses seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to facilitate factual reasoning across regions. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art Large Language Models struggle in detecting false premises across various countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning scenarios. This highlights the necessity for enhanced false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models.

Abstract: As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our Stage 1 dataset with 200+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.

Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly, rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson $\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

Summary: 
This study investigates the role of including English data in Continued Pretraining (CPT) for language adaptation. While including English does not affect validation perplexity, it is crucial for developing downstream capabilities in the target language. A language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL) highlights the importance of including English in CPT to prevent early catastrophic forgetting during training. The absence of English data leads to a significant shift in model parameters and hinders the model's ability to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language. The study introduces curriculum learning and exponential moving average of weights as effective strategies to reduce the reliance on English data in CPT. These insights shed light on the dynamics of emergent abilities in language adaptation and provide a foundation for designing more effective adaptation methods in the future. <div>

Abstract: Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.

Abstract: This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs). DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for natural language processing.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a new method for utilizing unvoiced electromyography (EMG) as a communication tool for individuals who cannot produce vocal speech. Unlike previous approaches that required both voiced and unvoiced EMG signals along with speech data, this method focuses solely on unvoiced EMG signals. By developing an EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into a large language model's input space, the average word error rate for converting unvoiced EMG to text was significantly reduced. Even with minimal data availability, the model outperformed specialized models by 20%. While large language models have been effective in speech recognition tasks, adapting them to understand articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG poses challenges. This study marks a significant advancement in enabling large language models to comprehend unvoiced speech patterns using surface EMG signals. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech using surface EMG.

<div> compression, Large Language Models, lossless, LZ77, semantics

Summary:
The paper introduces a task-agnostic lossless compression technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) similar to LZ77. The technique reduces the input token sequence length by an average of 27% and 18% for two evaluation tasks. This results in 47% and 33% less encoding computation due to the quadratic nature of attention in transformer-based LLMs. The transformation is easily reversible, preserving semantic information. The approach is evaluated on tasks requiring strict preservation of semantics/syntax, showing that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this context. The lossless compression technique only produces a small performance gap compared to using the uncompressed input, suggesting that with larger models and increased computing resources, the gap could be eliminated entirely. <div>

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are used for generating movie reviews by utilizing three different models, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0. The study evaluates the generated reviews based on factors like vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency compared to IMDb user reviews. Results show that while LLMs produce syntactically fluent reviews, emotional richness and stylistic coherence still need improvement. Participants in a survey had difficulty distinguishing LLM-generated reviews from IMDb reviews. DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, GPT-4o had an emphasis on positive emotions, and Gemini-2.0 showcased excessive emotional intensity. Overall, LLMs have potential for generating movie reviews, but further refinement is necessary to enhance the quality and emotional depth of the generated content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews, suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews. We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0 captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

Abstract: As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1) improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without SkillVerse.

Summary: TreeRare is a new framework proposed to enhance question answering tasks that require complex and knowledge-intensive reasoning. It utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning in a bottom-up fashion, generating subcomponent-based queries at each node to resolve uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module synthesizes relevant passages into context-aware evidence, which is aggregated across the tree to form a final answer. Experimental results across various datasets show that TreeRare outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in handling ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning questions. <div>

Abstract: In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive, requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex, knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Code-mixing involves the seamless integration of linguistic elements from multiple languages within a single discourse, reflecting natural multilingual communication patterns. Despite its prominence in informal interactions such as social media, chat messages and instant-messaging exchanges, there has been a lack of publicly available corpora that are author-labeled and suitable for modeling human conversations and relationships. This study introduces the first labeled and general-purpose corpus for understanding code-mixing in context while maintaining rigorous privacy and ethical standards. Our live project will continuously gather, verify, and integrate code-mixed messages into a structured dataset released in JSON format, accompanied by detailed metadata and linguistic statistics. To date, it includes over 355,641 messages spanning various code-mixing patterns, with a primary focus on English, Mandarin, and other languages. We expect the Codemix Corpus to serve as a foundational dataset for research in computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and NLP applications.

<title>Beyond Context to Cognitive Appraisal: Emotion Reasoning as a Theory of Mind Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: emotion recognition, language models, Theory-of-Mind, cognitive appraisal theory, dataset<br />
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are often used for emotion recognition but struggle with understanding emotional states beyond surface-level cues. This study explores how LLMs reason about emotions using contextual information within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. By creating a specialized ToM evaluation dataset grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, the researchers assessed the models' ability for both forward and backward reasoning. The study found that LLMs can reason to some extent but struggle to associate situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. This highlights the importance of incorporating psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs for emotion reasoning. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models (LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information, within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

Summary: 
The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has enhanced its speech foundation models by integrating the YODAS dataset, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license. Despite challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text misalignments, a scalable data-cleaning pipeline was developed to curate a dataset of 166,000 hours of speech across 75 languages. The new series of OWSM v4 models trained on this curated dataset, along with existing OWSM data, have shown significant performance improvements on multilingual benchmarks. These models have even outperformed frontier industrial models like Whisper and MMS in various scenarios. The cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and associated scripts will be publicly released via the ESPnet toolkit.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license. However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across 75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the ESPnet toolkit.

<div> Keywords: test-time computation, large language models, semantic clustering, uncertainty quantification, context-aware semantics

Summary:
Test-time computation is crucial for improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs). Semantic clustering, which groups outputs with the same meaning, plays a key role in enhancing LLM performance. However, existing methods often rely on external models, leading to high computational costs and limited context-awareness. To address this, Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC) is proposed as a lightweight and context-sensitive solution that uses internal hidden states of the generator LLM for clustering. LSC eliminates the need for external models, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining or exceeding the performance of current methods. This approach has been extensively tested across various LLMs and datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing test-time scaling strategies.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

Summary:
Neuro2Semantic is a novel framework that decodes the semantic content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG recordings. The approach involves aligning neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings using an LSTM-based adapter, followed by a corrector module that generates natural text from the aligned embeddings. This method allows for unconstrained text generation and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method with only 30 minutes of neural data. The results showcase the potential of Neuro2Semantic in practical applications such as brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding technologies. <div>

Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding technologies.

Summary: 
Effective communication training is crucial for nurses to provide high-quality patient care. While standardized patient simulations are valuable, they can be costly and inflexible. Virtual patient systems offer a scalable alternative, but most lack the ability to adapt to trainees' varying communication skills. Adaptive-VP, a framework introduced in this study, utilizes large language models to dynamically adjust virtual patient behavior based on trainee input. The framework includes a pipeline for creating flexible yet clinically sound scenarios and a system for evaluating trainee communication in real time and modifying virtual patient responses accordingly. Evaluation results showed that Adaptive-VP produced natural and realistic interactions, reflecting real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses confirmed its effectiveness, positioning it as a scalable and valuable tool for nursing communication training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time, while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for nursing communication training.

Summary: 
SHARE is a new approach for self-correction in text-to-SQL tasks that addresses two critical limitations in existing methods. It utilizes Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline to transform declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories, enabling more precise error localization and efficient correction. SHARE also introduces a hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient training. Experimental results show that SHARE significantly enhances self-correction capabilities across various Large Language Models (LLMs). It remains robust in low-resource training settings, making it valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy concerns. <div>
arXiv:2506.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2) LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

Summary: 
The article introduces the 3E Criteria for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of search strategies in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights the trade-off between performance and computational cost in current methods and proposes the Speculative Reward Model (SRM) to enhance decision-making efficiency. SRM integrates an external reward assigner and a speculative verification mechanism to guide search strategies towards optimal actions. The framework is tested on various complex tasks, showing a significant reduction in costs while maintaining effectiveness. SRM achieves this by reducing reliance on LLMs' self-evaluation and pruning suboptimal choices to improve overall performance. <div>

Abstract: Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation. And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while maintaining effectiveness.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the optimization of textual prompts in large language models (LLMs) through the Textual Gradient Descent (TGD) framework. It highlights that scaling the number of training examples initially improves TGD's performance but later degrades it for various NLP tasks. Data scaling improves results but also increases computational costs. To address this, the Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) method is proposed, which reweights prompt sampling based on past batch distributions to facilitate scalable in-context learning. Empirical results across nine NLP tasks show that TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines and reduces variance, particularly in tasks such as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks. This approach enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of optimizing textual prompts in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models (LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates (or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks - TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

<div> Keywords: children, automatic speech recognition, causal structure discovery, fine-tuned models, interdependent relationships

Summary: 
Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance is influenced by various factors, including physiological differences, cognitive development, and external factors like vocabulary and background noise. Existing analysis often overlooks the interconnected nature of these factors, such as how age impacts both ASR accuracy and pronunciation skills. In this study, a causal structure discovery method is used to untangle the relationships between physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors in children. Causal quantification is then employed to measure the impact of each factor on children's ASR performance. The analysis is extended to fine-tuned models to determine which factors are alleviated by fine-tuning and which persist. Experiments on Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 ASR systems validate the findings' generalizability across different models. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into understanding and improving children's ASR accuracy by considering the complex interplay of physiological, cognitive, and extrinsic factors. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological (e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation), and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across different ASR systems.

<div> adaptive parallel decoding, diffusion large language models, throughput, quality, autoregressive decoding

Summary: 
Adaptive Parallel Decoding (APD) is introduced as a method to enhance the generation speed of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) by dynamically adjusting the number of tokens sampled in parallel. This approach deviates from traditional autoregressive decoding by combining dLLM marginal probabilities with an auxiliary autoregressive model for more efficient token generation. By optimizing APD with techniques like KV caching and limiting input size, it offers three tunable parameters to balance throughput and quality tradeoffs. APD demonstrates significantly higher throughput while maintaining minimal quality degradation on various downstream benchmarks. This innovative method provides a promising solution to the bottleneck of autoregressive decoding in LLMs and showcases the potential for achieving faster generation speeds without compromising model quality. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding, where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: In context learning, text generation, noisy annotations, perplexity, debiasing framework

Summary:
In the study, a new approach is proposed for detecting noise in annotations in the context of text generation for in context learning (ICL). The existing method based on perplexity is reexamined to address biases arising from annotations and large language models (LLMs). A dual debiasing framework is introduced to correct perplexity estimates using synthesized neighbors, leading to a robust Sample Cleanliness Score that accurately identifies sample cleanliness regardless of overall corpus noise levels. Extensive experiments showcase the superior noise detection capabilities of the proposed method, with ICL performance comparable to fully clean demonstration corpora even in the presence of high noise ratios. The approach demonstrates resilience to extremely high noise levels, making it a promising solution for improving the quality of demonstrations in ICL settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are extremely high.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on enhancing chatbots by incorporating both visual and auditory aspects into conversations. Existing research has mainly focused on visual tasks, neglecting auditory elements. The new Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$) dataset is introduced for this purpose. A novel multimodal conversation model with multimodal memory retrieval is proposed and trained on the $M^3C$. The model is capable of engaging in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs. Human evaluations show the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, indicating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions, multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models. This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens. This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1) Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3) Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models' generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1) general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage, we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods. Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical summarization systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates a critical design decision in the practice of massively multilingual continual pre-training -- the inclusion of parallel data. Specifically, we study the impact of bilingual translation data for massively multilingual language adaptation of the Llama3 family of models to 500 languages. To this end, we construct the MaLA bilingual translation corpus, containing data from more than 2,500 language pairs. Subsequently, we develop the EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite of four massively multilingual models -- continually pre-trained from the Llama 3 family of base models extensively on diverse data mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7 tasks and 12 benchmarks demonstrates that bilingual data tends to enhance language transfer and performance, particularly for low-resource languages. We open-source the MaLA corpus, EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite artefacts, code, and model generations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet their significant computational demands hinder practical deployment. While efforts to improve LVLM efficiency are growing, existing methods lack comprehensive evaluation across diverse backbones, benchmarks, and metrics. In this work, we systematically evaluate mainstream acceleration techniques for LVLMs, categorized into token and parameter compression. We introduce EffiVLM-Bench, a unified framework for assessing not only absolute performance but also generalization and loyalty, while exploring Pareto-optimal trade-offs. Our extensive experiments and in-depth analyses offer insights into optimal strategies for accelerating LVLMs. We open-source code and recipes for EffiVLM-Bench to foster future research.

<title>PVP: An Image Dataset for Personalized Visual Persuasion with Persuasion Strategies, Viewer Characteristics, and Persuasiveness Ratings</title>

Abstract: Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images. To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset, comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized visual persuasion.

Abstract: Multi-hop questions still stump large language models (LLMs), which struggle to link information across multiple reasoning steps. We introduce Auto-Patch, a novel method that dynamically patches hidden states during inference to enhance multi-hop reasoning in LLMs. Building on the PatchScopes framework, Auto-Patch selectively modifies internal representations using a learned classifier. Evaluated on the MuSiQue dataset, Auto-Patch improves the solve rate from 18.45\% (baseline) to 23.63~$\pm$~0.7\% (3 runs), narrowing the gap to Chain-of-Thought prompting (27.44\%). Our results highlight the potential of dynamic hidden state interventions for advancing complex reasoning in LLMs.

<title>Synergizing LLMs with Global Label Propagation for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00488</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aiclaudev/DAT.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have demonstrated strong advantages in addressing complex real-world tasks. However, due to the introduction of additional attack surfaces, MASs are particularly vulnerable to misinformation injection. To facilitate a deeper understanding of misinformation propagation dynamics within these systems, we introduce MisinfoTask, a novel dataset featuring complex, realistic tasks designed to evaluate MAS robustness against such threats. Building upon this, we propose ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework leveraging goal-aware reasoning for precise misinformation rectification within information flows. Our experiments demonstrate that in challenging misinformation scenarios, ARGUS exhibits significant efficacy across various injection attacks, achieving an average reduction in misinformation toxicity of approximately 28.17% and improving task success rates under attack by approximately 10.33%. Our code and dataset is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/ARGUS.

<title>Evaluating the Evaluation of Diversity in Commonsense Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00514</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics. Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of their outputs.

<title>CausalAbstain: Enhancing Multilingual LLMs with Causal Reasoning for Trustworthy Abstention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings. Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language (\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings, outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic and commonsense knowledge QA tasks. Our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/peachch/CausalAbstain.

arXiv:2506.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property (IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental results on a Taiwan patent Q&amp;A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid, cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment. A demo version of the instantiated is available at https://github.com/renruntao/patent_rag.

<title>Decoupling Reasoning and Knowledge Injection for In-Context Knowledge Editing</title>

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bebr2/DecKER .

<title>ARIA: Training Language Agents with Intention-Driven Reward Aggregation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens, resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance, hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional, multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/MSumBench.

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed and screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity. While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense, the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse. In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered, multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.

Abstract: A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems, when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

arXiv:2506.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts. Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives. To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source, end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component, enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable, and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

Abstract: Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation (KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic evaluations of medical LLMs.

<title>Improving Dialogue State Tracking through Combinatorial Search for In-Context Examples</title>

Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking. (iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

Abstract: Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood. Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions, border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

Abstract: Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA (Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection (TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for future research in speech content moderation.

<title>Improving the Calibration of Confidence Scores in Text Generation Using the Output Distribution's Characteristics</title>

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

<title>SATA-BENCH: Select All That Apply Benchmark for Multiple Choice Questions</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

Abstract: Stuttering is a complex disorder that requires specialized expertise for effective assessment and treatment. This paper presents an effort to enhance the FluencyBank dataset with a new stuttering annotation scheme based on established clinical standards. To achieve high-quality annotations, we hired expert clinicians to label the data, ensuring that the resulting annotations mirror real-world clinical expertise. The annotations are multi-modal, incorporating audiovisual features for the detection and classification of stuttering moments, secondary behaviors, and tension scores. In addition to individual annotations, we additionally provide a test set with highly reliable annotations based on expert consensus for assessing individual annotators and machine learning models. Our experiments and analysis illustrate the complexity of this task that necessitates extensive clinical expertise for valid training and evaluation of stuttering assessment models.

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific, requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data, and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation schemas. Code, models, and synthetic datasets are available at neilus03.github.io/guidex.com

Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating, brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting, outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than zero-shot prompting.

Abstract: Malicious attackers can exploit large language models (LLMs) by engaging them in multi-turn dialogues to achieve harmful objectives, posing significant safety risks to society. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense mechanism: SafeTy Reasoning Elicitation Alignment for Multi-Turn Dialogues (STREAM). STREAM defends LLMs against multi-turn attacks while preserving their functional capabilities. Our approach involves constructing a human-annotated dataset, the Safety Reasoning Multi-turn Dialogues dataset, which is used to fine-tune a plug-and-play safety reasoning moderator. This model is designed to identify malicious intent hidden within multi-turn conversations and alert the target LLM of potential risks. We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM capability.

<title>Measuring Faithfulness and Abstention: An Automated Pipeline for Evaluating LLM-Generated 3-ply Case-Based Legal Arguments</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

<title>From Argumentative Text to Argument Knowledge Graph: A New Framework for Structured Argumentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00713</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

Abstract: Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information, making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model (LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.

<title>Structured Gradient Guidance for Few-Shot Adaptation in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks, the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy, gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular, the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

Abstract: Narrative frames are a powerful way of conceptualizing and communicating complex, controversial ideas, however automated frame analysis to date has mostly overlooked this framing device. In this paper, we connect elements of narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons. An anonymized version of DefenderBench is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DefenderBench.

Abstract: In video dubbing, aligning translated audio with the source audio is a significant challenge. Our focus is on achieving this efficiently, tailored for real-time, on-device video dubbing scenarios. We developed a phoneme-based end-to-end length-sensitive speech translation (LSST) model, which generates translations of varying lengths short, normal, and long using predefined tags. Additionally, we introduced length-aware beam search (LABS), an efficient approach to generate translations of different lengths in a single decoding pass. This approach maintained comparable BLEU scores compared to a baseline without length awareness while significantly enhancing synchronization quality between source and target audio, achieving a mean opinion score (MOS) gain of 0.34 for Spanish and 0.65 for Korean, respectively.

Abstract: We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation (e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms, where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

<title>Assortment of Attention Heads: Accelerating Federated PEFT with Head Pruning and Strategic Client Selection</title>

arXiv:2506.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited. This is mainly due to challenges specific to FL, such as resource-constrained devices and diverse data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups, XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of 3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

Abstract: Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian, Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset, comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate, reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source. This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages, contributing to more equitable and accurate translation systems.

<title>Understanding and Mitigating Cross-lingual Privacy Leakage via Language-specific and Universal Privacy Neurons</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information (PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the (sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons. Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced by 23.3%-31.6%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to 256k tokens.

<title>Improving Automatic Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Biomedical Relation Extraction via LLMs-as-the-Judge</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However, evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets. We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k samples in total) for public use here: https://github.com/tahmedge/llm_judge_biomedical_re.

<title>KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.

Abstract: Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture, research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural, stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures. We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in human-written and LLM-generated texts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances recency and factuality in answers. However, existing evaluations rarely test how well these systems cope with real-world noise, conflicting between internal and external retrieved contexts, or fast-changing facts. We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset (RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

<title>Fast or Slow? Integrating Fast Intuition and Deliberate Thinking for Enhancing Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important, and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory, which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will be released.

<title>GuessBench: Sensemaking Multimodal Creativity in the Wild</title>

Abstract: We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings, natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling: even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by 15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data, while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural contexts and low-resource languages.

<title>From Plain Text to Poetic Form: Generating Metrically-Constrained Sanskrit Verses</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition. However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit? In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically, we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over 99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile, instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal trade-offs in metrical precision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will be available.

<title>Probing the Geometry of Truth: Consistency and Generalization of Truth Directions in LLMs Across Logical Transformations and Question Answering Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs.

<title>HERGC: Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion for Multimodal Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at https://github.com/kzjkzj666/CompKE.

<title>Toward Structured Knowledge Reasoning: Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

<title>How Bidirectionality Helps Language Models Learn Better via Dynamic Bottleneck Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language models.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

<title>What's Missing in Vision-Language Models? Probing Their Struggles with Causal Order Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2506.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance. Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for future work on causal understanding.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this, existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations. Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

<title>Not Every Token Needs Forgetting: Selective Unlearning to Limit Change in Utility in Large Language Model Unlearning</title>

arXiv:2506.00876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private, sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&amp;A testing on large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small number of questions and answers.

Abstract: Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions. The dataset is available in https://github.com/JunyingWang959/A4Bench/.

Abstract: LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior, raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs' formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

Abstract: Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional. In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality. Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of compositionality.

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.

Abstract: Sarcasm fundamentally alters meaning through tone and context, yet detecting it in speech remains a challenge due to data scarcity. In addition, existing detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline. The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

<title>From Objectives to Questions: A Planning-based Framework for Educational Mathematical Question Generation</title>

Abstract: Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology. Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex, multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize" approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate data management due to their ability to process text from various document formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries. However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA. Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior, particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe), overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this, we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news, covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building trustworthy LLMs.

arXiv:2506.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.

<title>LEMONADE: A Large Multilingual Expert-Annotated Abstractive Event Dataset for the Real World</title>

Abstract: This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising 39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented global conflict events for over a decade.
  To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask, abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models. Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for AEL.
  Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further research.

<title>What do self-supervised speech models know about Dutch? Analyzing advantages of language-specific pre-training</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

Abstract: Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

Abstract: Access to humanities research databases is often hindered by the limitations of traditional interaction formats, particularly in the methods of searching and response generation. This study introduces an LLM-based smart assistant designed to facilitate natural language communication with digital humanities data. The assistant, developed in a chatbot format, leverages the RAG approach and integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as hybrid search, automatic query generation, text-to-SQL filtering, semantic database search, and hyperlink insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, experiments were conducted to assess the response quality of various language models. The testing was based on the Prozhito digital archive, which contains diary entries from predominantly Russian-speaking individuals who lived in the 20th century. The chatbot is tailored to support anthropology and history researchers, as well as non-specialist users with an interest in the field, without requiring prior technical training. By enabling researchers to query complex databases with natural language, this tool aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in humanities research. The study highlights the potential of Large Language Models to transform the way researchers and the public interact with digital archives, making them more intuitive and inclusive.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures, parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.

We present an embodied emotion classification dataset, CHEER-Ekman, extending the existing binary embodied emotion dataset with Ekman's six basic emotion categories. Using automatic best-worst scaling with large language models, we achieve performance superior to supervised approaches on our new dataset. Our investigation reveals that simplified prompting instructions and chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy, enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger ones.

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

Abstract: Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers. We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers, those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept space. Code is available at https://github.com/cisnlp/code-specific-neurons.

Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable "hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by 20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with 1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g. quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they reduce performance with others. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/metehanoguzz/LLMs-Indexicals-English.

<title>Contextual Candor: Enhancing LLM Trustworthiness Through Hierarchical Unanswerability Detection</title>

Abstract: The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting, RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset, Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness, highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness, ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities: Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities. For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the community.

<title>A Word is Worth 4-bit: Efficient Log Parsing with Binary Coded Decimal Recognition</title>

Abstract: System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

<title>Mispronunciation Detection Without L2 Pronunciation Dataset in Low-Resource Setting: A Case Study in Finland Swedish</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS, trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech.
  We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization, followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity, requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).

<title>The Inverse Scaling Effect of Pre-Trained Language Model Surprisal Is Not Due to Data Leakage</title>

Abstract: In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on 'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora. Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

<title>LAQuer: Localized Attribution Queries in Content-grounded Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast, existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2) suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3) proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized attribution in content-grounded generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for low-resource NLP.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes, adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT), Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts, introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

<title>Incorporating Hierarchical Semantics in Sparse Autoencoder Architectures</title>

arXiv:2506.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences. We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy, sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We release both our code and data: https://github.com/coastalcph/lm_ambiguity.

<title>Mamba Drafters for Speculative Decoding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their cross-model adaptability.

arXiv:2506.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second, it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH, demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally, REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving both efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar \underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories. The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs. With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence, paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding. Our code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/SungHo3268/KoGEM.

Abstract: This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing 11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric. Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2) models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning, diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism. To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning, prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts, providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models. Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wayyuanyuan/MTCMB.

Abstract: Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging. We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks. We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

Abstract: FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language. By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping, prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems. Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches, allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for unknown words.

<title>Beyond In-Context Learning: Aligning Long-form Generation of Large Language Models via Task-Inherent Attribute Guidelines</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning. Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines (MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable, learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically with automatic prompt optimizers.

<title>Detoxification of Large Language Models through Output-layer Fusion with a Calibration Model</title>

Abstract: Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data, designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding. Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

<title>Schema as Parameterized Tools for Universal Information Extraction</title>

Abstract: Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm, especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively, delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources, including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels, ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

Abstract: A recent rise in online content expressing concerns with public health initiatives has contributed to already stalled uptake of preemptive measures globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.

<title>Growing Through Experience: Scaling Episodic Grounding in Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01312</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration, limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters). While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities, they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks. Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models in Crisis Detection: A Real-World Benchmark from Psychological Support Hotlines</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01329</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across 15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open- and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

<title>Enhancing Interpretable Image Classification Through LLM Agents and Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances interpretability assessments by 30%.

Abstract: The emergence of ChatGPT marked a transformative milestone for Artificial Intelligence (AI), showcasing the remarkable potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like text. This wave of innovation has revolutionized how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements, the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs. Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities. The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that ALLMs present for the Arab world.

<title>TurnBench-MS: A Benchmark for Evaluating Multi-Turn, Multi-Step Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses, receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds. This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both, underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes. However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response. Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart, then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths. Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types. Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

<title>The Surprising Effectiveness of Negative Reinforcement in LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to $256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$ performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

Abstract: Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions, ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet, a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content, MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks the MMD between the generated documents and documents generated with various temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is benchmarked on two machine translation datasets, on which it outperforms natural competitors.

Abstract: Prompting-based conversational query reformulation has emerged as a powerful approach for conversational search, refining ambiguous user queries into standalone search queries. Best-of-N reformulation over the generated candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability. However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

Abstract: The popularity of automatic speech-to-speech translation for human conversations is growing, but the quality varies significantly depending on the language pair. In a context of community interpreting for low-resource languages, namely Turkish and Pashto to/from French, we collected fine-tuning and testing data, and compared systems using several automatic metrics (BLEU, COMET, and BLASER) and human assessments. The pipelines included automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis, with local models and cloud-based commercial ones. Some components have been fine-tuned on our data. We evaluated over 60 pipelines and determined the best one for each direction. We also found that the ranks of components are generally independent of the rest of the pipeline.

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive comparison of New York Times-style text generated by six large language models against real, human-authored NYT writing. The comparison is based on a formal syntactic theory. We use Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) to analyze the grammatical structure of the texts. We then investigate and illustrate the differences in the distributions of HPSG grammar types, revealing systematic distinctions between human and LLM-generated writing. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the syntactic behavior of LLMs as well as humans, within the NYT genre.

Abstract: We introduce UniversalCEFR, a large-scale multilingual multidimensional dataset of texts annotated according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference) scale in 13 languages. To enable open research in both automated readability and language proficiency assessment, UniversalCEFR comprises 505,807 CEFR-labeled texts curated from educational and learner-oriented resources, standardized into a unified data format to support consistent processing, analysis, and modeling across tasks and languages. To demonstrate its utility, we conduct benchmark experiments using three modelling paradigms: a) linguistic feature-based classification, b) fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs, and c) descriptor-based prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our results further support using linguistic features and fine-tuning pretrained models in multilingual CEFR level assessment. Overall, UniversalCEFR aims to establish best practices in data distribution in language proficiency research by standardising dataset formats and promoting their accessibility to the global research community.

<title>Self-Refining Language Model Anonymizers via Adversarial Distillation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains, where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full dataset used in our experiments.

<title>Redundancy, Isotropy, and Intrinsic Dimensionality of Prompt-based Text Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification, clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant. Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

Abstract: This paper reports on the development of a large-scale speech recognition model, Whale. Similar to models such as Whisper and OWSM, Whale leverages both a large model size and a diverse, extensive dataset. Whale's architecture integrates w2v-BERT self-supervised model, an encoder-decoder backbone built on E-Branchformer, and a joint CTC-attention decoding strategy. The training corpus comprises varied speech data, of not only public corpora but also in-house data, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to different speaking styles and acoustic conditions. Through evaluations on multiple benchmarks, Whale achieved comparable performance to existing models. In particular, it achieves a word error rate of 2.4% on the Librispeech test-clean set and a character error rate of 3.4% on the CSJ eval3 set, outperforming Whisper large-v3 and OWSM v3.1.

Abstract: Extracting useful signals or pattern to support important business decisions for example analyzing investment product traction and discovering customer preference, risk monitoring etc. from unstructured text is a challenging task. Capturing interaction of entities or concepts and association mining is a crucial component in text mining, enabling information extraction and reasoning over and knowledge discovery from text. Furthermore, it can be used to enrich or filter knowledge graphs to guide exploration processes, descriptive analytics and uncover hidden stories in the text. In this paper, we introduce a domain independent pipeline i.e., generalized framework to enable document filtering, entity extraction using various sources (or techniques) as plug-ins and association mining to build any text mining business use-case and quantitatively define a scoring metric for ranking purpose. The proposed framework has three major components a) Document filtering: filtering documents/text of interest from massive amount of texts b) Configurable entity extraction pipeline: include entity extraction techniques i.e., i) DBpedia Spotlight, ii) Spacy NER, iii) Custom Entity Matcher, iv) Phrase extraction (or dictionary) based c) Association Relationship Mining: To generates co-occurrence graph to analyse potential relationships among entities, concepts. Further, co-occurrence count based frequency statistics provide a holistic window to observe association trends or buzz rate in specific business context. The paper demonstrates the usage of framework as fundamental building box in two financial use-cases namely brand product discovery and vendor risk monitoring. We aim that such framework will remove duplicated effort, minimize the development effort, and encourage reusability and rapid prototyping in association mining business applications for institutions.

Abstract: This paper describes the language identification and multilingual speech recognition system developed at Tallinn University of Technology for the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge. A hybrid language identification system is used, consisting of a pretrained language embedding model and a light-weight speech recognition model with a shared encoder across languages and language-specific bigram language models. For speech recognition, three models are used, where only a single model is applied for each language, depending on the training data availability and performance on held-out data. The model set consists of a finetuned version of SeamlessM4T, MMS-1B-all with custom language adapters and MMS-zeroshot. The system obtained the top overall score in the challenge.

<title>Integrating Neural and Symbolic Components in a Model of Pragmatic Question-Answering</title>

Abstract: Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for balancing neural and symbolic components.

Abstract: Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text, has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable alternative to human annotation.

<title>Argument-Centric Causal Intervention Method for Mitigating Bias in Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01488</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01488</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution (CD-ECR) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether event mentions across multiple documents refer to the same real-world occurrence. However, current CD-ECR approaches predominantly rely on trigger features within input mention pairs, which induce spurious correlations between surface-level lexical features and coreference relationships, impairing the overall performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACCI achieves CoNLL F1 of 88.4% on ECB+ and 85.2% on GVC, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The implementation and materials are available at https://github.com/era211/ACCI.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

<title>CVC: A Large-Scale Chinese Value Rule Corpus for Value Alignment of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2506.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics. All data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Beijing-AISI/CVC, and the code is available at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/CVC.

Abstract: Rapid growth in speech data demands adaptive models, as traditional static methods fail to keep pace with dynamic and diverse speech information. We introduce continuous speech learning, a new set-up targeting at bridging the adaptation gap in current speech models. We use the encoder-decoder Whisper model to standardize speech tasks into a generative format. We integrate a learnable gated-fusion layer on the top of the encoder to dynamically select task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks, demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.

Abstract: Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge of epistemic modality in LLMs.

<title>FormFactory: An Interactive Benchmarking Suite for Multimodal Form-Filling Agents</title>

Abstract: Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module, and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into robust, practical form-filling agents.

Abstract: With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework, containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained, interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData, and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

Abstract: High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000 synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems. Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them. Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$ (Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lwhere/STORM-BORN.

Abstract: Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages. Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages, demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

Abstract: Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and creative adaptation.

arXiv:2506.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways. Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits. Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy: especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI forecasting.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu. Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of news.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP, exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient. We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains, and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models.

Abstract: Word sense analysis is an essential analysis work for interpreting the linguistic and social backgrounds. The word sense change detection is a task of identifying and interpreting shifts in word meanings over time. This paper proposes MMD-Sense-Analysis, a novel approach that leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to select semantically meaningful variables and quantify changes across time periods. This method enables both the identification of words undergoing sense shifts and the explanation of their evolution over multiple historical periods. To my knowledge, this is the first application of MMD to word sense change detection. Empirical assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1) evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world information-seeking tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model. The codes and datasets are in https://github.com/MidiyaZhu/KVWEFFER.

<title>MVAN: Multi-View Attention Networks for Fake News Detection on Social Media</title>

Abstract: Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user comments. We develop a novel neural network based model, \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a reasonable explanation.

Abstract: Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for the same concepts across languages.

<title>ESGenius: Benchmarking LLMs on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Sustainability Knowledge</title>

Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136 multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231 foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example, "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\% with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

Abstract: Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

<title>StochasTok: Improving Fine-Grained Subword Understanding in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming, and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in 'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple subword-level language games, including character counting, substring identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch. These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models.

<title>When LLMs Team Up: The Emergence of Collaborative Affective Computing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01698</link>

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2) Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social intelligence.

Abstract: The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g., plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that (1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping, Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not specified.

Abstract: Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks. Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching 68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization capabilities and robustness.

<title>SRPO: Enhancing Multimodal LLM Reasoning via Reflection-Aware Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.

<title>Tug-of-war between idiom's figurative and literal meanings in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an autoregressive transformer.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science research in LLMs.

<title>Benford's Curse: Tracing Digit Bias to Numerical Hallucination in LLMs</title>

arXiv:2506.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems, producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

arXiv:2506.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes, resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role) and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing attention diversion and style drift.

Abstract: Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper, we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods, language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text, along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality transcription.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, the ability to follow instructions has emerged as a key metric for evaluating their practical utility. However, existing evaluation methods often focus on single-language scenarios, overlooking the challenges and differences present in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MaXIFE: a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess instruction-following capabilities across 23 languages with 1,667 verifiable instruction tasks. MaXIFE integrates both Rule-Based Evaluation and Model-Based Evaluation, ensuring a balance of efficiency and accuracy. We applied MaXIFE to evaluate several leading commercial and open-source LLMs, establishing baseline results for future comparisons. By providing a standardized tool for multilingual instruction-following evaluation, MaXIFE aims to advance research and development in natural language processing.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Abstract: Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3, and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized, automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical scenarios.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

Abstract: The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war, February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust, whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies on social media influence in military conflicts.

Abstract: In this paper we describe NAVER LABS Europe submission to the instruction-following speech processing short track at IWSLT 2025. We participate in the constrained settings, developing systems that can simultaneously perform ASR, ST, and SQA tasks from English speech input into the following target languages: Chinese, Italian, and German. Our solution leverages two pretrained modules: (1) a speech-to-LLM embedding projector trained using representations from the SeamlessM4T-v2-large speech encoder; and (2) LoRA adapters trained on text data on top of a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. These modules are jointly loaded and further instruction-tuned for 1K steps on multilingual and multimodal data to form our final system submitted for evaluation.

<title>Analysis of LLM Bias (Chinese Propaganda &amp; Anti-US Sentiment) in DeepSeek-R1 vs. ChatGPT o3-mini-high</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct, cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore, such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.

<title>BD at BEA 2025 Shared Task: MPNet Ensembles for Pedagogical Mistake Identification and Localization in AI Tutor Responses</title>

Abstract: We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification) and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

Abstract: With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), the automation of daily tasks, like automatic writing, is getting more and more attention. Hence, efforts have focused on aligning LLMs with human values, yet humor, particularly professional industrial humor used in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.

Abstract: Citation quality is crucial in information-seeking systems, directly influencing trust and the effectiveness of information access. Current evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context, encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.

Abstract: There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

Abstract: The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs.

Abstract: We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models (LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).

<title>Is Extending Modality The Right Path Towards Omni-Modality?</title>

Abstract: Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models, especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models, where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

Abstract: Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability. The source code can be found here: https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/Spatial2Sentence.

Abstract: This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets, identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490 challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1. Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant variations in model performance across different domains, with particular challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%, showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language, and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation. Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work, we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms, enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: [http://s-sahoo.github.io/Eso-LMs](http://s-sahoo.github.io/Eso-LMs)

Abstract: Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains. The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices. In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like proximal policy optimization.

Abstract: Effective wastewater and stormwater management is essential for urban sustainability and environmental protection. Extracting structured knowledge from reports and regulations is challenging due to domainspecific terminology and multilingual contexts. This work focuses on domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) as a first step towards effective relation and information extraction to support decision making. A multilingual benchmark is crucial for evaluating these methods. This study develops a French-Italian domain-specific text corpus for wastewater management. It evaluates state-of-the-art NER methods, including LLM-based approaches, to provide a reliable baseline for future strategies and explores automated annotation projection in view of an extension of the corpus to new languages.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering (MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically, on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

Abstract: Generative retrieval shed light on a new paradigm of document retrieval, aiming to directly generate the identifier of a relevant document for a query. While it takes advantage of bypassing the construction of auxiliary index structures, existing studies face two significant challenges: (i) the discrepancy between the knowledge of pre-trained language models and identifiers and (ii) the gap between training and inference that poses difficulty in learning to rank. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel generative retrieval method, namely Generative retrieval via LExical iNdex learning (GLEN). For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic lexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to learn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and documents. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using identifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead. Experimental results prove that GLEN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance against existing generative retrieval methods on various benchmark datasets, e.g., NQ320k, MS MARCO, and BEIR. The code is available at https://github.com/skleee/GLEN.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their remarkable compatibility with Hardware Description Language (HDL) design. In this paper, we examine the performance of three major LLMs, Claude 3 Opus, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-4o, in designing finite state machines (FSMs). By utilizing the instructional content provided by HDLBits, we evaluate the stability, limitations, and potential approaches for improving the success rates of these models. Furthermore, we explore the impact of using the prompt-refining method, To-do-Oriented Prompting (TOP) Patch, on the success rate of these LLM models in various FSM design scenarios. The results show that the systematic format prompt method and the novel prompt refinement method have the potential to be applied to other domains beyond HDL design automation, considering its possible integration with other prompt engineering techniques in the future.

Abstract: How does textual representation of audio relate to the Large Language Model's (LLMs) learning about the audio world? This research investigates the extent to which LLMs can be prompted to generate audio, despite their primary training in textual data. We employ a three-tier approach, progressively increasing the complexity of audio generation: 1) Musical Notes, 2) Environmental Sounds, and 3) Human Speech. To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary. Further research into techniques that can enhance the quality and diversity of LLM-generated audio can lead to an improvement in the performance of text-based LLMs in generating audio.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on external evidence retrieved at inference time. While RAG addresses critical limitations of parametric knowledge storage-such as factual inconsistency and domain inflexibility-it introduces new challenges in retrieval quality, grounding fidelity, pipeline efficiency, and robustness against noisy or adversarial inputs. This survey provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in RAG systems, offering a taxonomy that categorizes architectures into retriever-centric, generator-centric, hybrid, and robustness-oriented designs. We systematically analyze enhancements across retrieval optimization, context filtering, decoding control, and efficiency improvements, supported by comparative performance analyses on short-form and multi-hop question answering tasks. Furthermore, we review state-of-the-art evaluation frameworks and benchmarks, highlighting trends in retrieval-aware evaluation, robustness testing, and federated retrieval settings. Our analysis reveals recurring trade-offs between retrieval precision and generation flexibility, efficiency and faithfulness, and modularity and coordination. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions, including adaptive retrieval architectures, real-time retrieval integration, structured reasoning over multi-hop evidence, and privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms. This survey aims to consolidate current knowledge in RAG research and serve as a foundation for the next generation of retrieval-augmented language modeling systems.

Abstract: Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving, locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient diagnostic categorization.

<title>SafeCOMM: What about Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuned Telecom Large Language Models?</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for telecom tasks and datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training, revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales (1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance. Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence, highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in high-stakes medical tasks.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost, and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers, executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains. These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning, coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain, including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded, user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and digital policy.

Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies, as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this, anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults. This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy, but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models, notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails). Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining 98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8 percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall, DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI safety and alignment.

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference. This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

Abstract: This paper target in addressing the challenges of underthinking and overthinking in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by introducing Reasoning Control Fields (RCF)--a novel test-time approach that injects structured control signals to guide reasoning from a tree search perspective. RCF enables models to adjust reasoning effort according to given control conditions when solving complex tasks. Additionally, we present the Control-R-4K dataset, which consists of challenging problems annotated with detailed reasoning processes and corresponding control fields. To further enhance reasoning control, we propose a Conditional Distillation Finetuning (CDF) method, which trains model--particularly Control-R-32B--to effectively adjust reasoning effort during test time. Experimental results on benchmarks such as AIME2024 and MATH500 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 32B scale while enabling a controllable Long CoT reasoning process (L-CoT). Overall, this work introduces an effective paradigm for controllable test-time scaling reasoning.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.

Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures. Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which demonstrates its flexibility.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability, improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation, crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a globally interconnected world.

<title>Beyond Semantic Entropy: Boosting LLM Uncertainty Quantification with Pairwise Semantic Similarity</title>

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text summarization, and machine translation. Our code is available at https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/SNNE.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in harnessing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. While existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG); capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity. This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and +4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GRAG) places high demands on graph-specific retrievers. However, existing retrievers often rely on language models pretrained on plain text, limiting their effectiveness due to domain misalignment and structure ignorance. To address these challenges, we propose GPR, a graph-based retriever pretrained directly on knowledge graphs. GPR aligns natural language questions with relevant subgraphs through LLM-guided graph augmentation and employs a structure-aware objective to learn fine-grained retrieval strategies. Experiments on two datasets, three LLM backbones, and five baselines show that GPR consistently improves both retrieval quality and downstream generation, demonstrating its effectiveness as a robust retrieval solution for GRAG.

<title>RoboMoRe: LLM-based Robot Co-design via Joint Optimization of Morphology and Reward</title>

Abstract: Robot co-design, jointly optimizing morphology and control policy, remains a longstanding challenge in the robotics community, where many promising robots have been developed. However, a key limitation lies in its tendency to converge to sub-optimal designs due to the use of fixed reward functions, which fail to explore the diverse motion modes suitable for different morphologies. Here we propose RoboMoRe, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework that integrates morphology and reward shaping for co-optimization within the robot co-design loop. RoboMoRe performs a dual-stage optimization: in the coarse optimization stage, an LLM-based diversity reflection mechanism generates both diverse and high-quality morphology-reward pairs and efficiently explores their distribution. In the fine optimization stage, top candidates are iteratively refined through alternating LLM-guided reward and morphology gradient updates. RoboMoRe can optimize both efficient robot morphologies and their suited motion behaviors through reward shaping. Results demonstrate that without any task-specific prompting or predefined reward/morphology templates, RoboMoRe significantly outperforms human-engineered designs and competing methods across eight different tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts, we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and platform moderation.

<title>Dyna-Think: Synergizing Reasoning, Acting, and World Model Simulation in AI Agents</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

<title>Adapting General-Purpose Embedding Models to Private Datasets Using Keyword-based Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Text embedding models play a cornerstone role in AI applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While general-purpose text embedding models demonstrate strong performance on generic retrieval benchmarks, their effectiveness diminishes when applied to private datasets (e.g., company-specific proprietary data), which often contain specialized terminology and lingo. In this work, we introduce BMEmbed, a novel method for adapting general-purpose text embedding models to private datasets. By leveraging the well-established keyword-based retrieval technique (BM25), we construct supervisory signals from the ranking of keyword-based retrieval results to facilitate model adaptation. We evaluate BMEmbed across a range of domains, datasets, and models, showing consistent improvements in retrieval performance. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how BM25-based signals contribute to improving embeddings by fostering alignment and uniformity, highlighting the value of this approach in adapting models to domain-specific data. We release the source code available at https://github.com/BaileyWei/BMEmbed for the research community.

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions. We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a widely adopted strategy for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, significantly reducing memory and computational costs. However, most existing PEFT techniques uniformly deploy LoRA adapters across all layers, disregarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of layer contributions and task-specific rank requirements. This uniform paradigm leads to redundant parameter allocation and suboptimal adaptation efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose FLoE, a novel PEFT framework that introduces two key innovations: (i) a Fisher information-guided importance scoring mechanism to dynamically identify task-critical transformer layers for MoE-based low-rank adaptation, enabling sparse adapter deployment; and (ii) a Bayesian optimization-driven rank allocator that automatically determines optimal LoRA ranks on specific datasets without exhaustive grid search. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and benchmarks reveal that FLoE achieves impressive efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, making FLoE particularly advantageous in resource-constrained environments that necessitate rapid adaptation.

Abstract: Understanding urban socioeconomic conditions through visual data is a challenging yet essential task for sustainable urban development and policy planning. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models (LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view imagery. We construct a multi-modal dataset covering a total of 17 globally distributed cities, spanning 6 key domains: economy, education, crime, transport, health, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted nature of urban life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation, and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in predicting urban socioeconomic indicators. CityLens provides a unified framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding future efforts in using LLVMs to understand and predict urban socioeconomic patterns. Our codes and datasets are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityLens.

Abstract: Existing attacks against multimodal language models (MLLMs) primarily communicate instructions through text accompanied by adversarial images. In contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our implementation is made publicly available.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Directly training Large Language Models (LLMs) for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) remains challenging due to intricate reward modeling, dynamic agent interactions, and demanding generalization requirements. This paper explores whether post-training techniques, specifically Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), can effectively $\textit{generalize}$ to multi-agent scenarios. We use economic reasoning as a testbed, leveraging its strong foundations in mathematics and game theory, its demand for structured analytical reasoning, and its relevance to real-world applications such as market design, resource allocation, and policy analysis. We introduce $\textbf{Recon}$ ($\textbf{R}$easoning like an $\textbf{ECON}$omist), a 7B-parameter open-source LLM post-trained on a hand-curated dataset of 2,100 high-quality economic reasoning problems. Comprehensive evaluation on economic reasoning benchmarks and multi-agent games reveals clear improvements in structured reasoning and economic rationality. These results underscore the promise of domain-aligned post-training for enhancing reasoning and agent alignment, shedding light on the roles of SFT and RL in shaping model behavior.

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work, we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing. Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines. Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

Experimentally, our approach delivers comparable results to CRF while being faster, and achieves better results in highly constrained settings compared to mean field, another parallelizable alternative.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities. However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zihanghliu/LIFT.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1) identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments. Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1 rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions, which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended migration environment. The datasets are available at https://github.com/xdshen-ai/Benchmark-of-Code-Migration.

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Abstract: Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English, Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then, we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will open-source the constructed benchmark and code at https://github.com/NLPGM/PCogAlign.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures, facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text, bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal languages, corresponding to conversational input.

<title>Bridging the Gap: From Ad-hoc to Proactive Search in Conversations</title>

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers' performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

<title>Simple Prompt Injection Attacks Can Leak Personal Data Observed by LLM Agents During Task Execution</title>

Abstract: Previous benchmarks on prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) have primarily focused on generic tasks and attacks, offering limited insights into more complex threats like data exfiltration. This paper examines how prompt injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a 15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage. Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs, highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense efficacy.

<title>Attention Retrieves, MLP Memorizes: Disentangling Trainable Components in the Transformer</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization, and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction. While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer -- a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks, especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms. We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for solving different classes of tasks.

<title>Earley-Driven Dynamic Pruning for Efficient Structured Decoding</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language (DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel $\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time, significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly, Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order statistics. On the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a slight improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals are incorporated into Praat TextGrids using a point tier, and they are also output as a table for researchers to analyze separately as diagnostics or to incorporate uncertainty into their analyses.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic reasoning capacities.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs, desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However, existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online environments.

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plays a key role in speech processing, often utilizing hand-crafted or neural features. This study examines the effectiveness of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and pre-trained model (PTM) features, including wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, UniSpeech, MMS, and Whisper. We propose FusionVAD, a unified framework that combines both feature types using three fusion strategies: concatenation, addition, and cross-attention (CA). Experimental results reveal that simple fusion techniques, particularly addition, outperform CA in both accuracy and efficiency. Fusion-based models consistently surpass single-feature models, highlighting the complementary nature of MFCCs and PTM features. Notably, our best-performing fusion model exceeds the state-of-the-art Pyannote across multiple datasets, achieving an absolute average improvement of 2.04%. These results confirm that simple feature fusion enhances VAD robustness while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this \textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for the participants in the community to bridge the implementation gap.

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans (P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning. With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between different drugs (drug-drug interaction or DDI) is critical for ensuring patient safety and optimizing therapeutic outcomes. Existing DDI datasets primarily focus on textual information, overlooking multimodal data that reflect complex drug mechanisms. In this paper, we (1) introduce MUDI, a large-scale Multimodal biomedical dataset for Understanding pharmacodynamic Drug-drug Interactions, and (2) benchmark learning methods to study it. In brief, MUDI provides a comprehensive multimodal representation of drugs by combining pharmacological text, chemical formulas, molecular structure graphs, and images across 310,532 annotated drug pairs labeled as Synergism, Antagonism, or New Effect. Crucially, to effectively evaluate machine-learning based generalization, MUDI consists of unseen drug pairs in the test set. We evaluate benchmark models using both late fusion voting and intermediate fusion strategies. All data, annotations, evaluation scripts, and baselines are released under an open research license.

Abstract: We introduce LinearVC, a simple voice conversion method that sheds light on the structure of self-supervised representations. First, we show that simple linear transformations of self-supervised features effectively convert voices. Next, we probe the geometry of the feature space by constraining the set of allowed transformations. We find that just rotating the features is sufficient for high-quality voice conversion. This suggests that content information is embedded in a low-dimensional subspace which can be linearly transformed to produce a target voice. To validate this hypothesis, we finally propose a method that explicitly factorizes content and speaker information using singular value decomposition; the resulting linear projection with a rank of just 100 gives competitive conversion results. Our work has implications for both practical voice conversion and a broader understanding of self-supervised speech representations. Samples and code: https://www.kamperh.com/linearvc/.

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.
